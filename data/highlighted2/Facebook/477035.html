SUVs and two sedans Amazons new plane the Amazon One is set to launch Friday Rackspace could be getting bought out by Apollo Global Management Apple is rewarding hackers who find security flaws Its no secret that Amazon NASDAQ AMZN would be involved in leasing its own planes to improve its logistics operations But that plan is now set to go into action Friday with the company primed to launch the Amazon One The plane is an Amazonbranded Boeing NYSE BA and will be unveiled at Seattles Seafair Air Show And no CEO Jeff Bezos wont be the pilot Instead Atlas Air NASDAQ AAWW will be doing the honors Its among of the planes that the ecommerce giant has leased from Atlas and Air Transport Services Group NASDAQ ATSG So why is Amazon doing this Surprising to imagine but the company believes its logistics operations can improve But honestly the move is just for Amazon to continue cementing itself in our everyday lives The more efficient the supply chain the faster and potentially cheaper it can get products from Point A to Point B The faster it moves the products the quicker it can deliver and in the end hopefully the more products its customers will buy The end goal is to soak up not just onetime or occasional purchases but staple products as well Thats why the company has launched and continues to add to its bevy of Dash buttons It also sends a message to UPS NYSE UPS and FedEx NYSE FDX that before it gets to drone deliveries and other futuristic methods Amazon isnt afraid of anyone Including its delivery service Tesla NASDAQ TSLA is perhaps the most wellknown producer of electric cars but that hasnt prevented others from entering the race General Motors NYSE GM and BMW OTCPKBMWYY have introduced electric vehicles but theres another player entering the race MercedesBenz OTCPKDDAIY Reportedly Mercedes will produce four cars in total two SUVs and two sedans The company plans to roll out the new vehicles before with the first prototype being introduced in September at the Paris Auto Show Its expected that the vehicle will be an SUV with a driving range of roughly miles Would Mercedes be a competitive threat to Tesla Of course Add in BMW and the Californiabased Tesla will have its work cut out in Europe particularly in Germany But it seems as if Tesla CEO Elon Musk is welcoming to competition and even encourages it after he made TSLAs patents more widely available Why more competition The assumption is that it will drive interest and public awareness to the industry If Tesla is able to hold down the reputation for having the best electric car the thinking I believe goes along the lines of having BMW MercedesBenz and others drive interest with their ad dollars and branding power which will ultimately boost Tesla For what its also worth Mercedes and Tesla could also be battling for market share in the electric trucking market as well Shares of Rackspace NYSE RAX have been a disappointment for quite some time Before Thursday and Fridays big gain shares were down and over the past one and five years respectively But investors have got a bit of good news to end this week Rackspace could be a takeover target for Apollo Global Management Shares have been flying since up from Thursdays open Reports suggest the deal may happen around billion but a Wells Fargo analyst made the case that the stock could be valued at per share in a takeover attempt a little higher than current levels While the stock initially traded towards that figure on Friday it has since backed off and fallen to around Perhaps investors are hopeful but leery as buyout talks for Rackspace have surfaced before Given that this situation has happened before it really wouldnt be surprising to see nothing come of it But given that Rackspace has struggled against gigantic cloud competitors like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Amazon among many others perhaps a sale makes the most sense for management Likewise Apollo is reportedly looking to up its exposure to tech and given the relatively low market cap perhaps Rackspace would be a good fit After all Rackspace is trading at its lowest valuation in some seven years Buyers in previous years may have been turned off by the high valuation but with a low valuation its likely more attractive Apple NASDAQ AAPL has always been serious about security So serious in fact that rather than build a backdoor operating system for a specific case involving the FBI although it doesnt sound easy you know Apple could do it the company refused to do so The fear it said was that it could be used to jeopardize the security of other users phones The company was ready to fight all the way to Supreme Court if it had to And whether you agree with the company or not it doesnt change the fact that when faced with nearly all imaginable situations Apple will side with user privacy In that light it seems unsurprising that the company is now offering rewards for those who can find security flaws But its not open to just anyone First Apple will start with hackers that have previously notified the company of a potential issue Then the hacker or group will need to show proof and upon satisfaction Apple will dole out a reward between and The size of the payout depends on how severe the flaw is If the tactic sounds familiar its because a number of bigname tech companies already use similar tactics including Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Theres not much to dislike here The company is finding alternative ways to keeping its most valuable asset safe and thats the customer Im not sure why but it sort of reminds me of an exchange between legendary NFL quarterback Peyton Manning and teammate cornerback Tracy Porter In one spring practice Porter intercepted Manning on a series then got burned by a pass a few plays later ESPN The Magazines Ryan McGee added As he walked off the field the defensive back felt a hand on his shoulder It was the quarterback who said You tell me what I did wrong on that first play and Ill tell you what you did wrong on that next play Thats the only way were going to get better Deal I guess Im not sure why it reminded me of that exchange But it did Only this is more of a tell us what we did wrong and well pay you scenario Either way I think its good for Apple Or at least not bad The
