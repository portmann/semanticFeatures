free internet access for all program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has rebranded its Internetorg initiative to Free Basics and it now let people download and use a mobile app to access websites at zero data charge BernersLee assessed Free Basics as a walledgarden approach that violates his view what net neutrality should be I see free basics as a great free tool for students teachers and underprivileged people to tap online education materials Tim BernersLee the famous originator of the World Wide Web made it clear that he wants people to say no to Facebooks NASDAQ FB branded free internet initiative Free Basics Free Basics is Facebooks nonprofit organization that seeks to provide a select number of websites for free to underserved people living in developing countries Free Basics is a nonprofit partnership that taps the help of leading wireless operators allow free access to some websites on the approved list of Facebooks Free Basics program All the wireless telcos here in the Philippines a country of more than islands already signed up for this program BernersLee hinted that Free Basics or formerly known as Internetorg was a scheme that violates the net neutrality principle he holds dear My own take is that BernersLee would have said yes to Free Basics if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers free access to all websites not just a few ones He argued that Free Basics decision to offer only a select number of websites for free is somehow contrarian to the ideal vision of free flow of information that BernersLee aspired to when he created the World Wide Web However Im a greedy capitalist and an FB long BernersLee demand for Free Basics to enable free access to all websites is going to be detrimental not only to Facebooks bottomline but also to wireless carriers internet service providers and premium subscriptiononly website owners I am therefore going to contradict BernersLee and say yes to a selective Free Basics program Limiting it to essential websites that help students teachers and poor people to learn important online educational materials is already satisfactory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is already clearly spending big money for Free Basics even if it only provides free access to a limited number of websites The carriers themselves would not have agreed to support Free Basics if they did not get some kind on incentives from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Mark Zuckerberg already said last year that Facebooks Connectivity Lab is working hard and will spend money on satellites drones unmanned solarpowered aircrafts and lasers to help provide free internet access to remote locations in the world I certainly do not want <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to spend more money to incentivize all website owners to provide free access to their premiumcontent only websites Zuckerberg also made it clear that any website owner or developer is free to submit their sites for inclusion to the Free Basics nonprofit initiative Instead of encouraging people to boycott Free Basics I more of expected BernersLee to urge website owners to say yes to Free Basics The only requirement for any website to qualify for inclusion in Free Basics is it should be simple and dataefficient so that mobile operators dont lose too much money providing free internet access It was not a Facebookinitiated requirement the Free Basics partner carriers demanded that provision It is not the fault of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>if Free Basics now only offers a limited number of sites that could be accessed for free It is up to owners if they want they site to comply and be included to the free internet for all program of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The walledgarden accusation against Free Basics is therefore unfair and unjustified It is true that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will increase its advertising audience by enabling even the poorest of the poor to have free internet access However profiteering is clearly not the primary objective of Free Basics It is primarily intended to help underprivileged citizens like poor Filipinos living in remote areas finish their researchthesis paper so they could graduate from college In my country the unlimited day only prepaid internet mobile service costs pesos Sad but true my country still has millions of students that cannot afford this day prepaid mobile internet access I also live in a town of over people that is residing in the remote mountainous areas This huge population of my town mates are underserved because wireless carriers do not want to provide them with decent internet access because of it is uneconomical to put up cell towers in far flung areas Facebooks dream of putting up satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles to provide free internet access is something I really admire Free Basics will ultimately help billions of people get free access to online knowledge FB has performed beyond my expectations this year I am
