class='textDiv'>Why Ill Continue To Hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>And Not Touch Twitter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long FB MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article There is a lot to be said about using or consuming a companys product to get a feel for its heartbeat and lifeblood Based on using both Instagram and Twitter for business and organizational purposes I feel there is a clear cut reason why one company is up and the other is down This empirical evidence is not simply my own isolated observation as there is a clear winner in MAUs engagement and revenue The clear difference in growth and engagement of its users is why I will continue to hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and stay far away from Twitter There are not many times when empirical or anecdotal information and presentation is more than just supplemental in an investment case either bullish or bearish The times where it is useful as a driving factor are slim but when there is a stark difference between either side of the case it becomes more relevant than financials alone That is the case here where I have drawn on some meaningful empirical evidence beyond just my small bubble where it in turn drives the companys business and lifeblood directly What two companies am I referring to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR of course More specifically I am talking about Facebooks whollyowned Instagram Why do I write today about this comparison of application usefulness and business execution Its pretty simple I coown a small race team that is building its own brand and using social media as a major facet of that brand establishment We dont necessarily have time to drive engagement of our followers and fans beyond doing what any social media account owner would do which is posting and following up with likes requests and comments This isnt to say we are lazy in fact we enjoy the social aspect of the journey but when it takes grinding effort and a lot of following up to further that brand or image then were going to look for the best value of time versus engagement We began our social media engagement through YouTube since we are part of a visual and audiodriven market by nature Once that was established we desired to interact with others who shared our passions and interests on a more personal oneonone level I wanted something quick and easy and decided to go with Twitter Having never used Twitter I figured this would be a good reason to give it a try After setting up our account and filling it up with pictures information and some initial friends to follow us we were in business We began tweeting and posting semiregular updates and began our engagement As the weeks and months went by we didnt see a huge increase in engagement and only moderately saw our following increase I began thinking that this was going to take a lot of work Thereafter my coowner said we should also get an Instagram Also not having a reason to have an Instagram account prior we had one before I could spell my username I quickly learned that pictures are what everyone wants to engage with A huge portion of the internet population has succumbed to reading less and looking at pictures more It makes sense since reading takes effort comprehension and visualization while pictures tell a thousand words all on their own Of course you can post images on Twitter very readily but it isnt required to make a tweet On Instagram its all about imagery angles filters and perspectives Theres something more appealing about engaging with a picture rather than plain old text Our Instagram engagement has been far and wide a better experience than our Twitter We have doubled the number of followers on our Instagram compared to our Twitter account in less than four weeks We also noticed more of our friends and acquaintances are more likely to be on Instagram than Twitter when we were in the process of setting up our account Turning my focus to the backend rather than the frontfacing end of both apps I noticed that Instagram is far less bulky and cumbersome to use than Twitter Having used Twitter for nearly a year I still cannot open the app and easily remember how to get to my profile page In Instagram my menu is always visible and the icon is always there for me to go to my profile or back to my feed and then to my notifications Im a highly tech savvy person so for me to be confused by the UIUX user interfaceuser experience of Twitter says something All of this empirical evidence is simply that my own observations However I dont believe this to simply be my own experience and opinion How can I prove that you might ask It actually comes down to simple data sets We can start with how many active users there are on both sites Instagram for example surpassed M monthly active users MAUs users a few short months ago Twitter on the other hand reports M MAUs There is obviously an M user difference but theres more to it than that Source Data from Statista Chart is Authors Lets further break this down by examining the growth rates we are seeing at a comparable level To do this I take the time periods for Instagram data and create the same data time periods for Twitter Then I show the growth rates relative to each time period By examining the following chart we can see some substantial differences the largest being that Instagrams growth is in the middouble digits pretty consistently Twitter on the other hand is consistently in the high single and very low double digit range Source Numbers based on above charts chart is Authors Now of course the first thing many will say is that Twitter is much more mature in its user growth than Instagram There is no argument there Twitter has been established since while Instagram was founded in With a fouryear headstart it makes sense that Twitter has single digit growth for the most part The difference though is that Instagram has grown and surpassed Twitter in such a short period of time five years to be exact half of Instagrams existence Going even further into a comparison some will say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter share very little in common One is a microblogging site while the former is a fullfledged social network However Instagram is a closer comparison to Twitter and is the reason why I draw comparisons in users and their growth Another point that I will make is that many users of Twitter are found on Instagram and even more so on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>while the reverse cannot be said for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or Instagram users being on Twitter In a research report by Pew Research Center there is a concise collection of statistics outlining this Out of those who use Twitter of them use Instagram and of them use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Of those who use Instagram use Twitter and for those who use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>only use Twitter If I was a small business looking for a better engagement and to some extent I am with my race team its clear that my audience is residing on Instagram and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>This is apparent to me in my experience on both social media sites as Ive already described at the beginning of this article On a related thought to this I know it has been said time and time again that Twitter is the place to find a lot of celebrities athletes and other famous people This is great and all but as someone with a business or organization who is trying to gain a following and create engagement with their new brand why would I want to be where the attention is on the already famous With Instagram I am finding many groups and followings that are similar to me very easily Hashtags are a huge help in this and while Twitter may have invented the hashtag I find its use far more superior on Instagram than I ever have on Twitter The Financials Share A Similar Story To make the connection to an investment case I find that all of what I have described above translates into revenue on the business side of both public companies Let me start with the valuation of each and how they match up Twitter trades with a market capitalization of about B This is far less than what it was trading at just several months ago nearly twice the current market cap Instagram has been valued by some analysts to be worth around B This means in the present day that Instagram is worth almost three times as much as Twitter Oh did I mention those valuations of Instagram were a year or so old Thats not hard for me to believe with the way users are engaged on each platform and how more and more users join Instagram by the month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently does not break down Instagram revenue on its quarterly reports but there are estimates that believe Instagram will have over B in revenue by On the other hand Twitters trailing twelve month revenue is just now approaching B after existing for years Instagram didnt start producing revenue until according to eMarketer But lets say it actually started in when Instagram signed its first ad agency deal valued at M If the estimates turn out to be accurate that means Instagram will have the same B in revenue that Twitter has today after years of existence Twitter took years to get to B This means Twitter did it faster right Not so fast Twitter was bringing in revenue long before Instagram as Twitters revenue coming in around M So Twitter technically starting bringing in revenue about the time Instagram was born On the other hand Instagram had zero revenue up until Going back to that estimate it means Instagram would have grown its revenues more than twice as fast as Twitter as it would have only taken four years to go from zero to B This is also me cutting Instagram short remember the estimate is for B in B could very well be reached in mid or late There is a very telling story going on in the market right now As we all know there is quite the downward trend in the market since the start of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>entered the year near alltime highs and has fallen since those highs while Twitter entered the new year near alltime lows and has fallen close to further into uncharted alltime low territory A lot of tech stocks are getting hit hard right now With all that I have presented I dont wonder why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has fared so well against all other stocks especially against Twitter The market clearly thinks Twitter has an issue and broken business model as the stock continues to take out new lows while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hovers within reach of its alltime high The Reason For My Investment Decisions To bring this all together I am saying there is a clear difference in the products of both companies The UIUX is better in one product over the other the user engagement and user growth is seeing a steady outpacing and on top of that revenues are there to prove that the empirical evidence is not without support and fundamental backing It is due to this reason that I will continue to hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>while at the same time continue to stay far away from Twitter as an investment vehicle Twitters product while popular in most regards falls short on all tests that make the purpose of the product fruitful This is not just my opinion as the user growth and user engagement along with the statistics and revenues show a similar and agreeable story While this is not the sole reason I own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it is the reason why I have no plans of selling my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock It also is the reason even with Twitter falling to alltime lows why I will not purchase shares in the company There is clearly a winner and a loser in this segment of advertising and Instagram has the better product audience and financials to keep that trend moving in the right direction Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
