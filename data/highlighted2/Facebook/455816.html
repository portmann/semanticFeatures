class='textDiv'>One Year After Surpassing Walmart Amazon Is Now Bigger Than Berkshire Zero Hedge by Knave Dave Jul PM Nothing is moreshameless in a bedazzling sort of way than rich banksters standing on the public curb with their hands out Such is the spectacle across Europe today as its largest banks begin to crash by BullionStar Jul AM The Bank of England has emerged as an active subcustodian of gold bars held by the SPDR Gold Trust This raises the possibility that GLD holds borrowed central bank gold by Phoenix Capital Jul AM Despite the Bear Stearns hedge fund blow up stocks hit a new alltime high in late They are doing the same thing today ignoring numerous major warning signs that the business cycle is ending Jeff Bezos has marked another milestone Nearly one year to the day following Amazons surpassing of Walmarts market capitalization on the heels of a great report on AWS Amazon Web Services growth numbers Amazon has surpassed another American business icons market capitalization that of Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Notably tomorrow is Amazon Prime Day Leaving the big question when does Amazon rise to Apples market cap level or will Apple fall to Amazons market cap level Place your bets Boris Alatovkrap Jul PM This is measurement of size of customer If Walmart is measure sag of scooter cart chassis what is metric for success of Amazon Size of UPPS delivery truck How many food delivery per day This is scare pretty bird Manipuflation Jul AM Winston Churchhill rocks I later met Sally by the sea She showed me her wonderful grapes and oranges After that she agree to toss my salad Her mother came and watched I plan to take Sallys mother to the pumpkin patch Shes a lovely woman And knows Winston Churchill Toodles you ought to know the answer to that then again living in a former kommie place of course that would excuse you if you arewere a UN employee the point you do not know the meaning of real comfort and being idiotized by the consuming society aka herd of imbeciles because you lived in kommie place bezos as much as i despise his ideology and indeed ulterior motives has figured out the idiotized american consumerist the metric is how idiotized the populi is already and amazon resolve to make the life of these zombies more comfortable this is how a dengerous idiotologue becomes a real threat he figures out the way to become extremely wealthy and then goes and vomits his true intents and ideotology upon the masses reminds me of the herpes equivalent soros after all once you have grabbed such powerthe rest comes relatively easy since the majority if not all of the idiots will never realize the true intentions as for me i am just a peon sailing in a nutshell in a powerful river of ignorance incapable and most importantly unwilling to change what is unchangeable jeff montanye Oldwood Jul PM now mr oldwood amazon on most occasions makes a profit just not a big one or a clearly growing one although in both of the last two quarters it made about a buck a share whether the chart below supports a share price is a matter of some controversy roddy Oldwood Jul PM Bezos hides most of his profits in other countries He also has a lot of senior citizens working in nonairconditioned warehouses in the middle of summer for shit wages If he ever has to bring his profits back to America and pay taxes like most of us have to he might go under Also a change in the minimum wage law would hurt him a lot flaminratzazz Cabreado Jul PM I would rather sit here and buy a trinket from Amazon then go fight the hordes of walmart zombies and half humanoids and wind up with something that falls apart before I get it into the trunk of the car Between bidding on things and checking amazon for suggested retail prices I think we have a winning system The brick and mortar are going the way of the news papers and net work television Cabreado flaminratzazz Jul PM flaminratzazz Cabreado Jul PM if you are stating that the trend is the death of walmart newspapers and network tv then you are way wrong I despise all three Cabreado flaminratzazz Jul PM feldgrau Cabreado Jul PM How do you prep without AMZN Although ebay is getting to be as good or better w prices and free shipping As a history buff I think AMZN is great for books amazon is great for guitar fx pedals too but you can do the samesimilar maybe cheaper things at reverbcom or ebay among others amazon has pretty much everything though it is a lot easier than going to a mall but if theyre earning per quarter and the share price is thats a pe of maybe that too is the new normal Im sure its gonna make every investor rich beyond his widest imagination just as those who invested in Tulips firmly hoped so back in the day Amazon is recapitizing its debt to build treehouses in a dome Its a tax deductible time out zone for unruly employees Bet that some of those botanical rare plants wont make the urination watering HRH of Aquitaine Jul PM I dont know if anyone else has been paying attention to or learned about FBA It is wild There are also accusations of stealing ideas and products that FBA folks are trying to develop Who is the thief Amazon Considering tomorrow is the big Prime Day what was the Alibaba day Singles Day go buy yourself a present This rabbit hole seems to get deeper and deeper FBA is Fulfillment by Amazon Crazy concept I dont understand how they can afford to have warehouses of used books and afford the shipping costs I have bought and sold used books off and on The model just does not make sense to me Books are heavy and cost a fortune to ship move and warehouse I know I have a library with foot high bookshelves Dont ask me what my last move cost because this is the answer too much Cabreado HRH of Aquitaine Jul AM Ive been inside an Amazon fulfillment center If you get a chance to visit one do it the idea that they somehow generate a profit is mindblowing to anyone who sees their operation at the battlefield level Theres an unbelievable amount of damaged product the one I saw was a big and bulky products warehouse and there was trailer loads worth of product that was in the process of being liquidated to a wholesaler at cents on the dollar Addin a poor safety record high turnover rate and high labor costs Tijuana Donkey Show HRH of Aquitaine Jul AM FBA is the ultimate in real estate I use it its insane how cheap it is for my company They make money off the entire process Books are a small part of their biz now Walmart fucked themselves when they pulled their suppliers in and told them to slash their prices to stay on Walmart shelves Meanwhile Amazon helps you turnover more of your product and gives you warehouse space I walked into an Apple Store three weeks ago with a gift card and didnt see a single thing I wanted to buy I cant give this gift card away Atomizer Catullus Jul PM Walmart also makes the supplier buy back the inventory if minimum product turns are not met Walmart is a glorified distribution center Depending on product cost they make between GP margin Did I mention you pay for the shelf space to market your product Distribution product class Take the educational class About years ago to ratio Depends on transportation advertising and product defect returns All part of the illusion to make money as a partner with Walmart Straw Dog Catullus Jul PM How do they make money with prime members with the day shipping I ordered a pound medicine ball and the shipping alone had to be close to bucks if they had to charge shipping They are bleeding to death with this day shipping Atomizer heisenberg Jul PM Good point Thats the other trick You sell a product for a dollar SH Receive quote to ship and add on for shipping Dont forget product cost was only The other angle is to offer free shipping and build to into selling price Lastly you offer free SH and build in easy payments which include into product cost That way if customer returns productyou still havent lost money Just profit margins Remember were using a retail sales number of for product being sold All retail sales figures are subject to variations Wrote a book once Never got published as the publisher closed the doors as my book was going to print That was in the s Amazon has it listed but says out of print If Amazon sold it would I get any royalties I never gave them permission to put it on their site I wonder how much stuff they are selling and never paying royalties etc I have no use for Amazon or EBay Over rated There will always be a need for traditional type stores if nothing else as an excuse for people to leave their couches and move around a little Atomizer cherry picker Jul PM You didnt mail a copy to your mailing home address first mistake Take portions of the book and search if someone changed the title and kept the content Otherwise your book could be in limbo Who knows could be Amazon using a backlink to create clickbait ChargingHandle Jul PM lucky and good Jul PM Because of its massive advertising budget and other ties to the company the media often seems to be in bed with Amazon This means you seldom hear anything bad about the retail behemoth While the people who love and support Amazon might claim the points above show Amazon and its CEO to be clever cunning and masters of the game an argument can be make that an aura of evil hangs over much of what it has created Amazon is a job killer that abuses and exploits the brick and mortar stores that line streets throughout America People should consider what kind of community and society they want in coming years before jumping on the Amazon bandwagon Below are fifteen things Amazon is not in a hurry to tell you I tried to stop at ten but found it impossible wizteknet lucky and good Jul AM Sales taxes is really why I stopped using amazon as much since I do live in Texas found it cheaper on ebay on most occasions Plus in the beginning you didnt find out you owed taxes until after you ordered it till they fixed there app finally That might stop after Trump becomes president Bullshit marketing gig but consumers will fall for this crap and thats ok Just make it work to your benefit No scruples no
