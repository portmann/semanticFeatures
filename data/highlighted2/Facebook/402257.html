class='textDiv'>Amazon Web Services The New Face Of Tech Giants Profitability Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazon Web Services is now officially the highest operating income earner for the company The CFO says margins may be bumpy moving forward I add that they wont show any significant decline because of a key factor As Amazon Web Services takes over the responsibility of EPS growth for the foreseeable future it will boost market confidence in the companys high valuation More than two months ago on February I wrote an article called Amazon Web Services Holding The Profitability Bag For Amazon In that article I spoke about why I thought AWS would soon become the highest earner by operating income for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN at the pace it was growing My reasons were simple the companys cloud unit was growing along with the industry at doubledigit levels with very high margins of over while the retail business was continuing to see a fraction of that filtering down to the bottom line But to be honest even I did not expect AWS would overtake Amazons North America segment in as little as one quarter As of Q it officially leapfrogged over Amazons domestic retail business to become the lead operating income earner for the company Despite healthy overall sales growing across all three segments North America revenue grew by and International revenue grew by it was the growth in AWS that has bought in ample breathing space for Amazons overall bottom line So AWS which accounted for a mere of total revenue is now responsible for more than of the companys operating income as of Q But even in its two retail segments the company has seen slight improvements in its operating margins Are These Stellar Margins Temporary Amazon recorded a healthy operating margin in AWS but the company is not very confident of maintaining that high level moving forward During the Q earnings call CFO Brian T Olsavsky said Were very pleased with the quarter we came in at operating margin the new basis including stockbased compensation and other Were very pleased But stepping back with the growth in AWS which is now a billion business but on the margin side I would caution you that were pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the longterm margins in this business theyll be bumpy over time I agree with that assertion that the current margin levels in excess of might be a hard one to hold due to the fluid nature of an industry that is seeing a fourway competition between IBM Corp NYSE IBM Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Amazon and Google GOOG GOOGL However a deeper dive into the continual launches of highvalue services around the core cloud offering tells me that might not be the case Investorspeak Why Bumpy Not Declining Margins As you might know AWS has already cut prices over times So how do its margins continue to stay above the level despite that The answer is in those services I mentioned A quick look at Amazons reinvent for the last two years will tell you how quickly its offerings are expanding in the cloud space To put it simply the company is trying to simplify the job of technology teams and turning it into income for itself Amazon Kinesis Firehose To Stream data into the cloud Amazon Inspector For Security and Compliance I understand these are services that many of us have never heard of before but the point is that Amazon keeps adding to its features list and every new introduction makes it that much easier to operate in a cloud environment Thats the main reason the companys been able to sustain its margins despite the ongoing price war with the other cloud providers and thats why Im confident that as long as it keeps introducing valueadded services to its cloud ecosystem it will continue to see high margins for AWS Yes it will be bumpy as new revenues play catchup with deep discounting practices but I dont see the margins shrinking anytime soon Thats going to be a big boost for Amazon stock prices The company will now show consistent profitability but more importantly at least one segment has finally stepped up to fill the gap between reality and high valuation From now on the burden of EPS is squarely on AWSs shoulders and retail has the breathing space it needs to become consistently and significantly profitable over time As I advised earlier today in my article about investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB a dollarcost averaging approach would be the right one with AMZN as well These are stocks where high valuation is gradually being justified through greater profitability Amazon and new revenue streams <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>so you should definitely look at owning your piece of these companies as they grow to maturity and grow into their current valuations Big brothers shoes are finally starting to fit Thanks for reading this article To get first read on my upcoming work please click the
