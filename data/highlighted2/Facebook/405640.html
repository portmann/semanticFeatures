The company continues to lose search market share on desktop and mobile while Bing is steadily growing I started analyzing Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO in late prior to writing about the company in August and November of the following year At that time YHOO was trading around per share My research and that of numerous other analysts found a company that was trading well below its sumoftheparts value With a market capitalization of billion billion attributed to Alibaba NYSE BABA and a negatively valued core business this seemed like a nobrainer investment Two years after my initial investment my Yahoo shares have returned a paltry compared to a SP return during the same period This was a stock that was supposed to generate a return if we look back at the price targets set by several banks It did so briefly when Alibaba began approaching a billion market capitalization post IPO as Yahoo stock closely imitates Alibabas performance However as Alibaba shares have settled around a billion value as of late we have also seen a settling of Yahoo shares At the time of writing Yahoos market capitalization is billion essentially unchanged from the time of my investment the slight difference attributed to Alibabas performance and the companys buyback program Here are the details of trends I overlooked in my analysis and my opinion regarding the core business spinoff Source Yahoo Inc Q Financial Highlights Revenue has remained stagnant at Yahoo over the last five years staying within the billion range While acceptable for a company in the midst of a turnaround come July CEO Marissa Mayer will be entering her fifth year at the role and she has announced that will see a decrease in revenue Yahoo is projecting billion in revenue in as compared to billion in As of Q of this year Search accounts for of the companys revenue a YOY increase in source revenue contribution but a million decrease in Search revenue at million compared to million in the prior year While Search revenue increased in compared to it was due to higher priceperclick as Yahoo has seen its search query market share decrease during the same period Source Yahoo Inc Q Financial Highlights The company has recognized this and is aggressively building its Mavens also stylized as MaVeNS Mobile Video Native and Social business Mavens is projected to contribute just under billion in revenue in but will account for over twothirds of GAAP revenue by as a billion segment As depicted in the above graphs Yahoo has seen a steady decrease in search market share for over years Its global Search market share on desktop was as of April boosted in November by its default search agreement with Mozilla Globally on mobile Google GOOGL GOOG is unmatched with its market share In the US its largest revenue contributing market at Yahoos search market share is gradually decreasing Currently the platform is positioned at roughly market share also boosted in November by its default search deal within Firefox In addition Bings recent growth both domestically and in the global markets have eaten into Yahoos market share Bing is a billion business for Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT three times larger than Yahoos search business which in turn also powers over of Yahoos searches Keep in mind Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for billion at one point In search market share is king With it advertisers flock to your platform and you can be more aggressive in the rates you charge per ad While Yahoo is still a relevant platform in search and is generating higher priceperclick it is quickly losing market share to Bing and Google The company will have to continue to invest in Mavens if it wants to become a more relevant advertising platform Like many Yahoo investors I read what seems like every article related to the impending Yahoo spinoff Its an area of solace for many frustrated investors who are patiently waiting to realize any form of financial gain relating to Yahoo or Alibaba Yahoos core business is still an attractive asset During the companys Q earnings call CEO Marissa Mayer confirmed Yahoos collective platform still draws one billion monthly active users Mayer also mentioned the companys monthly active users on mobile doubled in While its search market share is decreasing the platform is still capable of drawing users and advertisers The companys advertising platform is a meaningful business and is enticing to potential acquirers Motif Investing reported on Seeking Alpha that as many as companies had expressed interest in Yahoo initially including SoftBank Group OTCPKSFTBY Britains Daily Mail OTCPKDMTGY OTCDMTGF and Time Inc NYSE TIME The current frontrunner seems to be Verizon NYSE VZ I wont comment on the synergies on a Verizon acquisition as many other analysts have already provided color on the potential deal With the addition of Starboard Value LPs chief executive Jeffrey Smith and three of his nominated directors to Yahoos board shareholders are fairly confident a spinoff will materialize in the coming months After four years at the helm Marissa Mayers Yahoo is still struggling to grow in a crowded search and advertising market Bing is quickly grabbing market share in the US and Yahoos mobile aspirations will struggle to compete with Google In advertising the competition is even greater with Bing and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB in the mix Yahoos core business can be viable with the right acquirer If acquired the company will have access to the capital needed to rapidly grow its Mavens business potentially reaching the billion segment target before But that is not the reason I am holding this stock Though I will likely hold to on to my shares going forward it is due to my desire to hold on to Alibaba not the potential billion ad business that is Yahoo I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Internet Information Providers </div></body></html>
