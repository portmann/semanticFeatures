style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter have been rampant in recent years Many longs claim Twitter finally had its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>moment meaning effective monetization and a visible path for strong revenue growth I will look at Facebooks meteoric rise from to and determine a range of outcomes for Twitter assuming similar performance at key business metrics Being short Twitter NYSE TWTR as a hedge to my long portfolio I was thinking the other day what if Twitter actually did just have its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went from a floundering desktopridden website to an advertising powerhouse and cash flow machine in a relatively short period of time I needed to obtain a clearer picture of Twitters upside should it have a business renaissance like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Both Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>operate in the social media space and derive the vast majority of their revenues from ads located on their platforms Even though the content and display mechanisms are different the content is exclusively user created Obviously there are no two companies exactly alike but I would argue the closest thing to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is Twitter aside from Instagram maybe But a larger audience and slightly different content should not make the comparison void I will look at Facebooks meteoric rise from approximately to impose the performance in key operating metrics onto Twitter then assign potential valuations under similar market conditions I will not be discussing the long term viability of either business logged out users certain accounting practices or any other hotbutton issue These topics have merit and should be considered before investing with or against either company but I will confine this article to the following primary metrics and the forecasted growth rates average revenue per user ARPU monthly average users MAU other revenue streams total revenue operating expenses adjusted EBITDA accepted under current market conditions GAAP Earnings and a market valuation Parameters and assumptions used for the comparison It was necessary to establish the quarter that each company had its moment For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>that period was Q For Twitter lets assume conservatively from a shorts perspective that quarter was Q creating a business time lag of six quarters The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>data from Q to Q will be used in modeling and predicting key metric performance and possible valuations for Twitter from Q to Q It was necessary to split the MAU and ARPU metrics between North America and the rest of the world due to the large differences in ARPU When possible I imposed Facebooks growth rates directly into Twitters numbers Just by looking at the Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>MAU and ARPU it is evident they are on different seasonal patterns This was ignored Twitter does not provide ARPU as a direct metric but can easily be found by multiplying ad rev per K timeline views by timeline views per MAU in thousands This simple table shows Facebooks ARPU broken down into two demographics US Canada and the rest of the world The growth is quite impressive and actually accelerating for this last quarter however lumpy it may be I calculated the second ARPU World excl US and Canada using a weighted average of MAUs and ARPU for the AsiaPacific European and Rest of World demographics as presented in Facebooks K For Twitters revenue growth I modeled a bullish neutral bearish and very bearish scenario ARPU growth was calculated as a percentage of Facebooks growth in this metric MAU and Data Licensing and Other growth rates were independent of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and estimated with historical data from Twitter Because Facebooks user growth is far superior to Twitter it was not viable to use the formers growth trajectory to predict the latters There is not much growth here other than ad rev per K timeline views Timeline views are essentially flat in both demographics and users are slightly up although more so with international markets Now onto the different scenarios for Twitters revenue growth The assumptions and growth rates are listed below each chart The noted growth rates below each table do not account for seasonality but seem reasonable should the company continue heading in the right direction The MAU growth rates take into account both user and timeline views growth For instance a user growth would be virtually equivalent to a user growth with timeline views growth or user growth with timeline views growth when multiplied by ARPU to get revenues Besides most Twitter longs and almost every Twitter short will tell you this story is no longer about user and timeline views growth but rather monetization ARPU growth rates were directly linked to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>subject to the time offset Im taking the phrase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>moment literally here I imagine Twitter longs would be thrilled with the same level of monetization <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has demonstrated over the last few quarters as it has been impressive There is no doubt Twitter can dramatically increase revenues over the next few quarters but it all depends on monetization of the existing user base Note that Twitters FY guidance for billion is between the Bearish and Very Bearish scenarios Another interesting debate is where the ceiling might be for ARPU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has taken this number from to very quickly and it appears to have gone parabolic Where this spaceship ends nobody knows Is each MAU worth Whether you believe Twitter can monetize similarly to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>this is a metric I will be closely following on Facebooks future earnings releases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has done a reasonably good job keeping operating costs down except for well this last quarter Well give Twitter a break and not include the anomaly I think for the average Once again I simply looked at Facebooks approximate operating expense growth over the last six quarters took the average and assigned that to Twitter The compounding effect in the model would overestimate these expenses over time but for six quarters it is tolerable These businesses are extremely lumpy so assumptions must be made Also note the EBITDA adjustments column I took the noncash items Twitter uses as adjustments to arrive at its preferred earnings metric of adjusted EBITDA added them for Facebooks Q Q found the growth rate and then used that to model Twitters EBITDA adjustments I will use those numbers to calculate GAAP earnings from adjusted EBITDA in a minute My fellow bears will get mad at me for showing Twitter containing its costs based on historical standards as this would be a true change of personality Once again I wanted to see where Twitter would be valued if it operated in a manner resembling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>during its great run And finally we get to whats really important The chart combines the revenue GAAP expenses and EBITDA adjustments On a side note my numbers for Q dont match exactly because I left out the interest expense Here are two graphs showing the range of quarterly earnings outcomes one GAAP and the other adjusted EBITDA The earnings are in dollar terms instead of EPS because guessing the outstanding share count over time is a near impossible endeavor My modeling based on Facebooks performance over the last six quarters has produced a very wide range of outcomes which would match the perception around the stock It is interesting to note Twitters guidance for FY of million in adjusted EBITDA doesnt even come close my Very Bearish scenario This is beating a dead horse but once again it comes back to monetization <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>found a way to massively increase the ARPU metric in a short amount of time If Twitter can match Facebooks excellence in this metric the stock will appear cheap in just two or three quarters If the company cannot find a way to get ARPU to or or begin cutting expenses meaningfully while not giving up too much revenue the stock will remain expensive Based on the above revenue operating expenses and earnings calculations we have arrived at potential valuations Please note these valuations assume a constant billion market cap current market cap The first thing to notice is anything less than a worlddominating performance and this company will not be profitable in FY on a GAAP basis but thats not much of a surprise However look at the Very Bearish column for adjusted EBITDA a PE for FY A multiple around this area could be within reach if the company handily beats estimates for two or three quarters this year That would give the bulls some firepower assuming the companys growth rate and monetization efforts continue to maintain positive momentum Based on the companys FY guidance of million in adjusted EBITDA the company would trade at approximately x EBITDA if the market cap held constant throughout the year After readers go through this article and forecast Im sure my assumptions and growth rates will be challenged But thats okay this is a forecast Will this article be perfectly accurate predicting Twitters business success moving forward I guarantee it wont But the objective was to show the evolution of Twitter should it replicate performance at key metrics similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>when applicable Based on company guidance for FY it appears very doubtful Twitter will make a run similar in nature to that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>over the last yearandahalf Twitter is no <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>So long as the market continues to accept adjusted EBITDA as a legitimate metric to value a company Twitter can appear reasonably or even underpriced with exceptional execution over the next year Twitters future valuation will be determined by absolutely positively one metric ad rev per K timeline views due to sluggish MAU growth If this shows any signs of slowing down in the near or intermediate future and usertimeline views growth remains stagnant expect volatility sharply to the downside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter will be fun stocks to watch They are high growth high expense creatures from a new world Many value investors such as myself are not comfortable investing long in companies with these valuations But within the next few years we will know who was right and who was wrong
