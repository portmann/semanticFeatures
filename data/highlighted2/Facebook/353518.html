lawsuits encryption iphone The highprofile legal standoff between Apple and the FBI recently came to an end when the government unlocked a terrorists iPhone without Apples assistance but new data confirms that this single showdown is just one of dozens of cases where the federal government has successfully used a more than yearold law to compel Apple or Google to aid authorities in bypassing smartphone security measures At the center of the recently concluded Apple vs FBI dispute is the All Writs Act which allows a judge to compel a person or group to assist in the enforcement of a court order but only if that assistance is both necessary and agreeable to the usages and principles of law In February the federal government successfully sought a court order under the All Writs Act compelling Apple to aid the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that had belonged to Syed Farook one of the shooters who killed people in San Bernardino CA on Dec Apple fought back against the court order arguing that this use of the All Writs Act was unprecedented and the governments request was not about one isolated iPhone but instead a case of the Department of Justice and the FBI seeking through the courts a dangerous power that Congress and the American people have withheld the ability to force companies like Apple to undermine the basic security and privacy interests of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe However in another Applerelated case in a New York federal court one in which the judge sided with Apple the DOJ told the court that it had previously used the All Writs Act dozens of times to compel Apples assistance and that the company had not balked This assertion led the American Civil Liberties Union to root around to see just how widespread the governments use of the All Writs Act had been in recent years According to data released today by the ACLU the group turned up court documents for cases plus at least another without docket numbers in states since where the government applied for a court order under the Act to compel the assistance of either Apple or Google Most of the court orders involve either password resets or lockscreen bypasses and many of them occurred before Apple and Google updated their operating systems in to remove previously existing backdoors Even those court orders coming after the security upgrades seem to involve phones seized before those changes went into place For example in the Department of Homeland Security sought a court order for Googles assistance in resetting the password for a Samsung smartphone belonging to a man arrested on child pornography charges However that phone had been seized in long before Google made it more difficult to assist in unlocking devices Similarly a court order obtained by the FBI is for an Android device seized in a drugrelated case a year earlier Speaking to the Wall Street Journal a rep for Google acknowledges that the company has obliged court orders but that it has never received an All Writs Act order like the one Apple recently fought that demands we build new tools that actively compromise our products security If Google were to receive this sort of demand compelling the company to weaken the security of the operating system it creates the rep says We would strongly object to such an order FBIs success in getting through iPhone security without Apples assistance is only going to make Apple Google and others tighten their privacy measures further both to prevent any third parties from using the FBIs workaround and to ensure securityminded customers that their data is protected The iPhone maker is reportedly already working on a device that would prevent the company from pushing software updates to locked iPhones meaning Apple would not be able to help law enforcement by replacing a secure operating system with a lesssecure version After Unlocking iPhone On Its Own Government Drops Effort To Compel Apples Help Apple
