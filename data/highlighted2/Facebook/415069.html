billions in RD Apple has historically focused on improving existing products for consumers They are a business not a research lab They focus on a limited number of ideas and there have been no signs of a shift in strategy under Tim Cook Apple this Apple that A main argument that bears make is that Apple NASDAQ AAPL needs to innovate Releasing a new iPhone color isnt innovation agreed What investors want is that next game changing product There are no guarantees but you have to play the RD lottery to win the RD lottery Interestingly possibly Apples best analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C Bernstein came out with a study a couple years ago He found that spending on RD doesnt guarantee any results obviously and overall there really isnt a correlation between spending and shareholder returns Tech or otherwise I have some theories why this would apply but a couple factors regarding innovation The Economic Recovery Act of gave us an RD tax credit Corporations have an incentive to classify everything as RD Is the next upgrade cycle of Windows really innovation How much RD is even innovation focused and how much is taking the iPhone to the iPhone s What if one company with a big RD budget pursues every willy nilly idea while the company with the smaller budget picks and chooses their battles more carefully from the get go It would be incredibly difficult to standardize the data factoring in true RD upgrades and long shot ideas vs more probable winners Steve Jobs echoed Tony Sacconghis comments in when he told Fortune that innovation has nothing to do with how many RD dollars you have Jobs was fond of pointing to his small RD spend as a key difference between Apple and Microsoft Some people can just do more with less Is it talent focus strategy luck For jobs Id say all of the above The X factor was Steve Jobs RD can be a cash pit Every engineer has their pet project that might be the next big thing they just need more time and resources to work on it Jobs was apparently good at spotting and cutting deadend projects early on He was a CEO with the engineering background that really understood the tech and had the ability to save millions of company dollars from sunk RD costs You cant say the same about at the time rival CEO Steve Ballmer Steve Jobs was winning the RD lottery and he wasnt even buying many tickets it wasnt luck Jobs kept a simplified product offering If Apple was a restaurant theyd have a few items on their menu and theyd all be delicious Thats easier from an RD perspective and inventorysupply chain than branching out so many ways Simple focused quality Focus Are you trying to invent cool new technology or technology that consumers will actually buy Apple admits that they may be passing up decent opportunities but they stay focused on money making ideas Apple is a business not a science lab Apple didnt even invent the MP player smartphone or tablet Others invented these products first Apple just improved them and made them more commercial friendly Its easier to improve an existing product and make it your own than create it from scratch A good artist copies a great artist steals When people say that CEOs arent worth X times the salary of the average employee blah blah blah I think those people are naive and dont understand business or even math and logic Some CEOs are overpaid others are underpaid just like any other job When you take the jealous emotion out of the argument you see that a poor CEO can drive a good company into the ground while a great CEO can turn a niche computer company into the most valuable company in the world Apple was saving billions on RD dollars yearly with Steve Jobs and the iPhone has one of the greatest ROIs of alltime Oh but Steve should have only been making X what the parttime pimply faced high school kid at the Apple store makes Steve Jobs was underpaid Apples approach to RD is secretive which is correct for a hardware tech vendor If you are in the market for a new phone but know that the iPhone is coming out and will have virtual reality built in and other bells and whistles you might not buy the now That hurts sales so they keep future initiatives close to the vest Other tech titans dont have to worry about that In terms of RD to revenue Apple invests a fraction of what their tech peers Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB pay In the trailing months Apple invested of revenue into RD while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was investing Alphabet Microsoft and Amazon As of Q earnings Apples number jumped to which is still less than half of their competitors when standardized by revenue Factor in that Amazons profits are a lot less than their middle man revenue and the numbers look even better In absolute terms Apple spends billions less than tech peers This year Apple is on track to spend billion and billion next year which is incredible considering they were spending a little over billion four years ago Data is from Neil Cybart at the Above Avalon blog If Apple was a baseball team theyd be the Oakland As that are spending less than the Yankees Red Sox Dodgers and theyd still be winning more games Steve Jobs would obviously be Billy Beane in this analogy The problem is that Jobs is gone and this data is backward looking The iPhone was the winning lottery ticket as was Windows as was Google search and Facebooks social network If Apples RD interests you again Id suggest reading this and other Above Avalon blog posts These next two charts from the blog illustrate that Apple is rapidly increasing RD For something big We dont know where those investment dollars are being directed Apple did mention an increase in headcount but theres plenty of speculation about Project Titan a car Overall the company is investing billion in capex including their acqusitions and capital improvements Apple Campus which could be complete next year is big enough to accommodate project Titan Apple also is opening an RD facility in Yokohama Japan an area known to specialize in vehicles and the health industry The Hyderabad India office will be a tech center The smartphone market in the developed world is coming to saturation of the population has a smartphone and many of the hold outs dont want them So what People are irrationally obsessed with their phones iOs is what of the market They cant just out compete Samsung OTCSSNLF and others Do people say that the clothing market is saturated so Under Armour NYSE UA cant grow No if their air wick shirts are better than their competition you buy them Many people replace their phones every year and a half maybe thats slowing to three years but its still a huge cash cow If iPhones are better than Samsung phones then forget the overall market THEIR market grows Even with slowing and declining revenue the company already is trading at a cheap price Its not like this is a PE stock with flat revenue like Procter Gamble NYSE PG If you take the debt out of the equation the financials look even better There are too many impatient investors who want a stock to always go up It doesnt work like that Cook has been buying shares on the way down Tis could be a redux Cook knows more about the RD than anyone and I dont think hes panicked at all It used to be that Apple was going to be the first trilliondollar market cap now the shorts are talking about Apple at s I initially bought Apple pre split under per share post split and made additional purchases on the way up maybe Added some during the last pull back without looking it up in I believe post split I trimmed some of my position when it hit and when it went over due to portfolio management and everything firing on all cylinders and a hope to buy back later cheaper My portfolio is still about Apple Ive had a great track record with this one and Im here to tell you the time to buy back in is now Im not sure what that amped up RD budget will bring a car heavily commercialized virtual reality D pictures improved voice search Siri additional breakthroughs in health wearables but Apple will innovate Im expecting results with their increased RD budget Apple lost their secret weapon in Jobs but the increased RD headcount and additional facilities show the companys commitment to innovation If Apple continues the Jobs way focusing on a few strongcreative ideas likely to make money instead of spreading thin and working on everything they should do well So far there are no indications of a strategy shift even with the increased spending Based on Apples sterling historical RD return on investment the market is currently underrating this stock Disclosure
