For that reason, to continue to spend on huge projects with little or no revenue potential in the near term, takes Google's eye off of its core business, which is in danger of losing its former appeal to competitive forces it should consider potential disruptors of its business model.Another factor is the average price per ad has dropped for Google since 2011, as smaller screens have exploded in use.Marketing departments don't consider them as effective as other content platforms.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The combination of disruption and declining ad price on average suggests the company needed to reassess its priorities. (Uncertainty) </span>Focusing on its core business is the right step to take.As for Amazon, it also faces a similar challenge, and the sooner it takes action to address this, the better.It also has chased after numerous projects outside of its core business.As mentioned, now that Prime is under assault, it will be forced to defend it, as that is the future revenue and earnings generator of the company as it now stands.The market has started to pressure the more mature tech companies to start showing earnings.Google is starting to respond to that demand, and I think Amazon will be forced to follow.Source: Google Is Showing The Way Amazon Must Go Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
