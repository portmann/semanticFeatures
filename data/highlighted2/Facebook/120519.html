spending the future of Google Amazon will be forced to take similar steps as WalMart attacks its core business A misconception over the strategy embraced by many tech companies is that they can continue to spend large sums of capital incurring huge debts as they scale out presumably having the ability to turn on the earnings spigot and become highly profitable companies After years of engaging in those practices Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has apparently started to understand that there is only so far you can take that model before it has to start acting like a real company It appears this is a major reason Google hired Ruth Porat as its new CFO in May to implement more discipline on the company which has gone far astray of its core business throwing money at numerous dubious projects Some may point to tech companies have to scale out before focusing primarily on earnings I dont dispute that But that scale must end up being able to be profitably monetized on a sustainable basis in order to justify the expenditures With six quarters in a row of missing earnings estimates it appears Google is starting to understand it must become more disciplined in its pursuit of new projects that have no guarantee of success and which are outside its core business After a couple of decades in business Amazon NASDAQ AMZN has a similar challenge as its leadership finds it difficult to rein in its ambitions and focus more on its core Internet retail business as I wrote about concerning the strategy and future of Amazon Now that WalMart NYSE WMT is striking quick and hard at its Amazon Prime business AMZN will be forced to take actions to defend its position I find that to be good for the company Amazon has also strayed far from its core business spending a lot of money on projects it has had a lot of mixed results with Its not that companies shouldnt try different things its that Amazon and Google have found it difficult to restrain themselves from a seemingly endless array of projects suggesting capital is being used as more of a playground for management than to build out a profitable business and business model For that reason its refreshing to see Google take these initial steps to be more disciplined in the projects it throws money at Hopefully Amazon will do the same which will make it even more desirable to investors The obvious problem for Google was its expenses were outpacing its revenue growth As quarter after quarter the company failed to meet earnings estimates it became obvious someone had to come in and make some changes From the last earnings report it looks like Porat is already making her presence in the company known as Google finally exceeded analysts expectations In the latest quarter the tech giant had earnings of per share blowing past the per share looked for by analysts Whats important here to me is it confirms even fastgrowing tech companies have limitations and the idea that they can spend with seeming impunity is not based on reality In other words all that money being spent wasnt generating revenue that offset it Again its understandable in the early years of a company but there comes a time when the adults must step in and settle things down That time for Google has arrived and that should make the company even better Now what Google must do is convince certain types of investors that this will be good for them over the long haul Even though the company has struggled to meet earnings expectations by throwing a lot of money around it gave the impression it was doing things that would pay off in revenue and earnings in the future That obviously didnt materialize and so the new era of austerity may be upon With that in mind Google now has to prove it can in fact turn on the earnings spigot in regard to its core advertising business If it isnt able to do that on a consistent basis questions will be raised on whether or not the numerous projects it touted were simply distractions to keep investors eyes off of its core performance I dont believe thats the case but Google must prove it That is exactly what it must to do in the quarters ahead Assuming some form of austerity continues Google will have to balance the two areas in order to show it can still invest in new projects wisely while continuing to grow earnings at a pace investors are looking for If it isnt able to do that it will show it is vulnerable Under Porats guidance Google will attempt to walk the austerityinvestment tightrope She said that while Google will continue to pursue opportunities that have a lot of potential upside it will do so with great care regarding resource allocation The company of course was using some of the spending as a form of marketing as it let media know about the various projects it was engaging in Whatever spending category one wants to put that under though the fact is it was spending that its revenue and earnings werent able to keep up with Googles great challenge is to find ways to compete stronger in its search and advertising business as major competitors like Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB provide other means of finding what consumers are looking for outside of search For that reason to continue to spend on huge projects with little or no revenue potential in the near term takes Googles eye off of its core business which is in danger of losing its former appeal to competitive forces it should consider potential disruptors of its business model Another factor is the average price per ad has dropped for Google since as smaller screens have exploded in use Marketing departments dont consider them as effective as other content platforms The combination of disruption and declining ad price on average suggests the company needed to reassess its priorities Focusing on its core business is the right step to take As for Amazon it also faces a similar challenge and the sooner it takes action to address this the better It also has chased after numerous projects outside of its core business As mentioned now that Prime is under assault it will be forced to defend it as that is the future revenue and earnings generator of the company as it now stands The market has started to pressure the more mature tech companies to start showing earnings Google is starting to respond to that demand and I think Amazon will be forced to follow Source Google Is Showing The Way Amazon Must Go Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
