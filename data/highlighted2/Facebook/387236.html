Estimize are in aggregate bullish on Tuesdays earnings On the other hand the social data analyzed by Likefolio shows an erosion in customer enthusiasm for Apple products and a confusion about the companys offerings With Apple NASDAQ AAPL reporting earnings next Tuesday delayed a day due to a memorial for Silicon Valley icon and former Apple board member Bill Campbell two startups that aggregate crowdsourced data offer a conflicted picture of the companys prospects On the bullish side the nearly Apple analysts reporting to Estimize collectively predict the company will beat Wall Streets consensus earnings estimate next week as the graph below shows The Estimize consensus earnings estimate shown above is cents ahead of the Wall Street consensus of Since its analysts include private investors as well as those from independent research shops buy side firms and sell side firms Estimize says its estimates tend to be more accurate than those from Wall Street analysts alone Theres a lot of chatter on social media about individual stocks but a challenge with generating useful data from it is the tendency of an investor to talk his book anyone who is long a particular stock is likely to make bullish comments about it and vice versa Likefolio attempts to surmount this challenge by mining comments about brands owned by publicly traded companies rather than the stocks themselves as the image above from its website illustrates Someone who comments about Yum Brands NYSE YUM on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Twitter NYSE TWTR or other social media platforms may be talking his book But for every YUM investor there are many more Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut customers and they are sharing their thoughts about those brands on social media constantly to see an example for yourself enter Taco Bell in the search field on Twitter now and click the Live tab A drop in social data sentiment and volume on Yum Brands offered a warning last June that was confirmed by the companys disappointing earnings release last October Likefolio posted a sell rating on Apple on Wednesday Limiting Downside Risk For Apple Longs For Apple longs buoyed by the bullish Estimize earnings prediction but concerned about the bearish trend suggested by Likefolios analysis well present a couple of ways of hedging the stock below First though a quick refresher on hedging terms Recall that puts short for put options are contracts that give an investor the right to sell a security for a specified price the strike price before a specified date the expiration date And calls short for call options are contracts that give an investor the right to buy a security for a specified price before a specified date Optimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest cost A collar is a type of hedge in which you buy a put option for protection and at the same time sell a call option which gives another investor the right to buy the security from you at a higher strike price by the same expiration date The proceeds from selling the call option can offset at least part of the cost of buying the put option An optimal collar is a collar that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest cost while not capping your possible upside by more than you specify In a nutshell with a collar you may be able to reduce the cost of hedging in return for giving up some possible upside Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find an optimal put and an optimal collar to hedge AAPL below but you dont need the app to do this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for an optimal put is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of If you are more riskaverse you could use a smaller threshold And if you are less riskaverse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Thursdays close to hedge shares of AAPL against a greaterthan drop by late October As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A couple of points about this cost To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the put In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your AAPL position would be down not including the hedging cost When scanning for an optimal collar youll need one more number in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a month period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap You dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that We checked Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of AAPLs potential return over the time frame of the hedge Every trading day the site runs screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the US and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return Potential return in its terminology is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next several months Apple passed both screens and the site estimated a potential return of for it We also calculated a potential return for Apple using Wall Street brokers median price target for the stock via Yahoo Finance pictured below That median price target of represented a increase from Apples Thursday closing price of but those price targets go out year so that suggests a potential return of over the next six months We decided to split the difference between the two estimates and use a cap of As of Thursdays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AAPL against a greaterthan drop by late October while not capping an investors upside by less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was a bit higher or of position value So the net cost was negative meaning an investor opening this collar would have collected an amount equal to or of position value Two notes on this hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal puts to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar Although the threshold takes into account positive hedging cost as we noted above it doesnt take into account negative hedging cost So taking into account negative hedging cost of the worstcase scenario for Apple investor hedged with this collar would be a drawdown of Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned
