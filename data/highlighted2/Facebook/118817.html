giant has long frustrated shareholders with out of control expenses Google has operating margins far below the other tech giants The hiring of a new CFO a few months back had shareholders hopeful that the new finance leader would help constrain the spending at Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL The Internet search leader has long spent heavy on research and development for projects far astray of the main money generator The stock though hasnt always seen the impact due to consistent revenue growth that hides unnecessary costs With a market cap of billion investors cant really complain If the new CFO can realign the business into a focus on costs without cutting back on legitimate growth areas the projection is for substantially higher profits per share One quick way to view the operating margins of Google is in comparison to other tech giants including Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB In comparison the other tech giants are producing considerably higher operating margins One can make a reasonable assumption that Google should even top the operating margins of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>While Apple is a mostly hardware firm that typically has lower margins Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are similar in their advertising focus With Google having the significantly larger revenue base of billion vs billion for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the bigger base would typically produce the higher margins Not to mention <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is aggressively building out services and ad products for not only the standard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform but also the new services of Instagram WhatsApp and Messenger The company has even forecasted costs surging over this year This brings us back to the news of the day that CFO Ruth Porat is actually requiring internal teams to justify spending including the hiring of new employees The head count totals detailed by the Wall Street Journal is probably the most notable shift in the Google mindset with reduced hiring taking place even prior the CFO joining back in May Looking at the operating margins from a nonGAAP basis that excludes stockbased compensation the Google margins jump to in Q Those improvements are in large part due to the lower employee growth but the hidden costs of extra stock issued hurts the EPS In the last year the share count grew by million shares or up In essence the slightly better margins were far outweighed by the higher share count causing a muted increase in EPS growth The EPS growth far trailed the revenue growth for the quarter On the flip side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>generated nonGAAP operating margins of for the quarter Even with the ramp up in expenses that reduced margins from the Q levels last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still far more efficient with expenses Where an improving margin will really help Google is with the valuation multiple The stock trades at about x earnings estimates that could jump if the new CFO can constrain operating expense growth Analysts only forecast the EPS growing by nearly in with revenue jumping Google isnt projected to produce a ton of leverage at that rate Along with controlling costs Google needs to limit the growth in shares outstanding One way the company could do itself a huge favor is to use the cash balances of billion to return capital to investors With a market cap of billion and strong cash flow despite the out of control expense growth the company could reduce the share count if it spent a billion or more each quarter on buybacks According to the below chart ignore the blip in Google has consistently hurt the EPS growth by the surge in outstanding shares GOOG Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Quarterly data by YCharts Going forward a increase in operating margins would add roughly to EPS estimates an amount equivalent to adding over basis points to the EPS growth rate Now if Google can mirror higher margins with a buyback that is able to reduce the outstanding shares the search giant would see EPS growth that could approach The key takeaway is that some fiscal responsibility could go a long way for the stock valuation of Google The company could easily generate higher profits while the market would award the company a higher PE multiple The resulting impact is a large jump in the stock price to new highs A simple increase in EPS estimates to up from now and a higher forward PE multiple of would send the stock up to or roughly higher from the Tuesday close Now imagine if the company produces margins inline with those of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Source Is Google Finally Growing Up Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it
