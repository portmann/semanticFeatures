Disney recently declared its second semiannual dividend of which goes exdividend this week Theres a longterm option play that pays in addition to Disneys dividends for a potential yield Disney has beaten analysts consensus EPS estimates for the past quarters This is the latest in our recent series of articles that illustrates options selling as a way to increase your yield on dividend stocks that may not have a very high dividend yield such as GE NYSE GE or alternatively to create some income on nondividend paying stocks such as Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB In most of these articles weve listed options trades with an expiration date thats around months out However since Walt Disney Co NYSE DIS is now paying semiannual dividends one in December and the other in July we took a look at how Disneys longterm LEAP options that expire in January would compare to its most recent semiannual dividend payouts Dividends Up until Disney had been declaring an annual dividend in late Novemberearly December However in fiscal it changed its policy to paying semiannual dividends the first one of which went exdividend on and paid The second semiannual dividend pays and goes exdividend on with a pay date of DIS has a very impressive year dividend growth rate of over but its trailing dividend yield is only hence our curiosity in seeing if we could improve upon this yield via selling options Options To be sure even though this option trade doesnt expire until January if your strategy is strictly long term then this idea may not be for you For example Disneys priceshare has risen over in the past year so covered call sellers would have missed out on some of those price gains The million dollar question of course can DIS do it again in There has been much debate about the companys highly profitable ESPN cable franchise due to lower subscription rates which has helped to depress Disneys priceshare over the past month Given all of the potential uncertainty the market faces in how many Fed rate hikes the US elections etc it might make sense to hedge ones bet This January covered call trade has a strike which currently pays a bid of around x the amount of Disneys next projected dividends Its above Disneys priceshare so you would have room for some potential price gains Since we dont know how large a dividend DIS will declare in July and December weve just added the current December dividend plus a repeat of the July dividend and a repeat of the December dividend in for a total of Could DIS pay more than that Absolutely given their dividend growth history However the strike price would compensate you share if your shares get assignedsold before the exdividend dates You can see more info for this and over other covered call optionselling trades in our free Covered Calls Table NYSE A If DIS doesnt rise above before the exdividend dates or before expiration your profit would be which includes the dividend and option Youd keep your shares NYSE B If DIS does rise above before the exdividend dates your profit would be the in option and the difference in price between the priceshare and the strike price Your shares would be assignedsold NYSE C This scenario is also possible given that this a month trade you may be able to collect all dividends and still have your shares assigned for a profitshare for a total profit of if DIS rises above after all exdividend dates However this is probably the least likely of these potential outcomes Puts DIS also has attractive longterm put option yields This January put option pays but you wont receive any dividends since you dont need to own the stock to sell puts against it The caveat here is that you have to be willing to buy DIS at share since it will get put sold to you if DIS goes much lower than However your cost will be minus the in put option you received Put option assignments tend to happen closer to the expiration date Analysts Estimates DIS has received upward EPS revisions for fiscal from analysts over the past days and for fiscal It has also beaten analysts consensus EPS estimates over the past quarters The buzz surrounding the upcoming release the new Star Wars movie has been intense and promises to be a blockbuster for Disney the teaser trailer had million downloads Source Disney Annual Report Heres an oddity though with analysts covering this stock youd think that thered be a closer price target range but there isnt Theres a dollar spread between the lowest target and the highest one Valuations You cant really say that DIS is undervalued on a trailing PE basis but its forward estimated PE is going in the right direction However even a Forward PE of is at the high end of Disneys year PE range The consensus estimate for EPS growth would represent growth which is still impressive for a mature company of Disneys size However it doesnt look undervalued on a PEG basis Disneys Media Networks and Consumer Products segments had the best margins in fiscal All of the companys segments had positive growth in fiscal with Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products leading
