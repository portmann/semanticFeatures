class='textDiv'>Instagram Isnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha I argue that the street is viewing Instagram and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>too closely together from an ad platform standpoint and that this has created a chance to buy FB at a discount I make the case that FB is cultivating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram into highly distinct two very specific ways to prepare for its longterm advertising efforts I also use Kissmetrics data to explain why Instagram might be the real advertising platform of the videoad future Continue to be long FB it should see a parabolic move higher once the street learns to silo the platform use cases Let me just get that out of the way early because thats going to be an important differentiation as your read this article Its also going to be something that I try to drive home the undervaluing of Instagram as a platform as a reason to be bullish FB On Monday RBC Capitals Mark Mahaney came out with a reiteration of his Outperform rating and his price target for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB the price target is roughly a premium to FBs most recent close Largely these expectations are being driven by the secular demand expectation which is already evidencing itself presently for video advertising and what should be Facebooks and Instagrams collective ability to service this demand effectively I couldnt agree more with Mahaney that FB should be able to deploy video ads across its platforms But my reasoning for why and to what level for each platform at least based on what has been made public from Mahaneys report appears to be quite a bit different from his Ive spent quite a bit of time the last few weeks opining on why I believe Facebooks ability to advertise effectively should only get better and better My thoughts on this have been strengthened by my belief that FB is positioning the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform for content and inbound marketing the early results of the Creative Accelerator program and the fact that FB has developed Lite a low data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>app for international or stressed infrastructure environments Now my thoughts on Instagram and why it will have high levels of ad efficacy are again quite a bit different from those for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but they basically boil down to the fact that Instagram isnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and thats a very very good thing for those long FB So what I mean by Instagram isnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is exactly whats implied These are two very different platforms with two very different conceptual flows Excuse the lack of a better term I hope I can make my point regardless If ancillary largely photo only quasisocial networks Pinterest give me some rope here Spring Instagram and a handful of other apps have shown us anything its that they arent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>More specifically when users deploy these apps they arent in the same state of mind and they arent desiring the same outcome they are when they deploy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has contributed greatly to this via its algorithm and its a more intimate social network thats about familiarity about connecting and about intimacy Again FB has worked hard to keep this the status quo by constantly working to eliminate viral content proliferation read Upworthy Gawker Viralnova etc and limiting what viewers see from an ad standpoint The former names are about discovery about the unknown and about entertainment Pinterest has perfected leveraging this flow into most recently the release of monetization efforts like Buyable Pins and an updated Guided Search Instagram which by the way has no algorithm but is a realtime feed display has slowly allowed greater advertising efforts as well Kissmetrics put out an incredible Infographic recently on the major structural differences for advertisers and brand marketers to recognize between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram In summary what it showed was that slowly advertisers are taking to Instagram to advertise in volume abandoning volume efforts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which are largely thwarted by the algo anyways and that Instagram users dont care that this is happening Thats right Instagram users have been unaffected by the increased overt marketing efforts First this doesnt mean that advertisers are abandoning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>altogether FBs financials show that just isnt true BUT what it does mean is that the ads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are clearly being selected more carefully whereas the ads on Instagram are being deployed in shotgun fashion The Kissmetrics data shows that this is actually the more efficacious way to advertise Again this is a good thing for FB longs Kissmetrics has been able to show that Instagram again simply being a realtime feed display becomes more effective for advertisers as they advertise in volume It also shows that with enough volume an advertiser or brand can create network momentum meaning that users will advertise for it using the brands hashtag even if not directly following the brand Also excellent in data it appears that there is no preferable time or day of the week to post for engagement Doesnt that seem like an advertiser dream The total FB ecosystem especially the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram platforms should only get stickier as if they arent already as FB can silo its two platforms further What I mean by that is the less untargeted unalgo checked advertisements users see on FB thanks to the elimination of viral content farmers the more attractive the network becomes to FB users The more volume of advertisements Instagram users see apparently according to volumetounfollowed hashtag usage data the happier Instagram users are to attach to a brand Thats an incredibly powerful message to a massive adspend budget slowly transitioning from TV to video both mobile and desktop based For me this is the big miss currently by The Street FB as a company is currently cultivating almost petridish style two very big very distinct very effective advertising platforms that marketers and brands can use across use cases Its going to be the onestop shop for advertising Its close now but again there are similarly competitive platforms like Pinterest that I would say rank parallel once it can further dialin the silos for both networks I think The Street outside of Mahaney apparently is too closely viewing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram platforms too closely together Instagram isnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt Instagram These networks need to be thought of as completely different segments rather than FB as a company As FB can continue its experimentation Instant Articles Creative Accelerator Instagram adbacklinking etc it should only be a more and more valuable outcome generator That means a more and more valuable company Again I think The Street is too rigid in thinking about FB as a concept I think theres money to be made in this misread as well
