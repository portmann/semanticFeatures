</span>Share on Twitter Comments Is There Truth In Advertising Dodge Brothers characters dodge charger brands car manufacturers John Dodge Horace Dodge chrysler evolution Commericals In a series of recent ads exploring the creation and evolution of Dodge and its famous Challenger and Charger models the car maker harkens all the way back to its origins as the Dodge Brothers Company toevoke a sense of spirit and competitiveness While these commercials are successful in eliciting the desired emotional response the company isnt quite telling the truth about John and Horace Dodge and their role in creating these popular muscle cars To evaluate the truthiness of the Dodge Brothers history presented in these commercials looked at the stories told in each of the ads The above commercial the second of the ads to aired by Dodge tries to establish the companys origins Dubbed Ahead of Their Time it centerson the beginning of the Dodge Brothers Company and the differences betweenitand Ford Motor Company By the Dodge brothers quit Ford Motor Company and set out on their own the commercial proclaims While this statement works to establish an environment of competition between the two companies it implies that John and Horace were just a pair of Ford employees with dreams of stepping out on their own In truth the brothers didnt technically work for Ford Motor Company In they founded Dodge Brothers Company which produced engine and chassis components for a number of companies including Olds Motor Vehicle Company and Ford According to a article from the New York Times Henry Ford struck a deal with the brothers in that gave the Dodges a interest in Henry Ford Automobile Company for building chassis Several years later the brothers set out to make their own cars instead of just carcomponents In they did just that producing the Dodge Model a direct competitor to the Ford Model T Unsurprisingly this resulted in a strained relationship between the Dodge brothers and Ford in which Ford stopped paying dividends to shareholders including John and Horace The Dodge brothers then brought a lawsuit against Ford claiming that he was using his control over the company to restrict dividend payouts even though the company was enormously profitable and could afford to pay large dividends to its shareholders according to a Cornell University report PDF titled Why We Should Stop Teaching Dodge v Ford In the end the Dodge brothers received million from Ford when the court ordered the payment of special dividends toshareholders So while there is a decent kernel of glossedover truth to the quitting Ford claim in that Dodge ad this next commercial attempts to draw a connection between the siblings competitive spirit and two of Dodges signature cars the Challenger and Charger In the ad we see John and Horace horsing around and finally jumping into what we can only presume are Dodge vehicles racing each other down a deserted highway The way in which the commercial is crafted with the vehicles seamlessly transforming from era to era gives the impression that the Dodge brothers played some important part in the evolution of the company that carries their name and the Charger and Challenger models That simply isnt the case Sadly both Horace and John died in decades before the first Charger or Challenger would hit the market According to Edmundscom the Challenger which has encompassed three different generations of automobiles first appeared on dealership lots in the late s Likewise the Charger brand wasnt produced until the mids While its entirely possible the Dodge brothers envisioned a fast muscle car of the future they werent around to see those models produced or evolving the way in which it is presented in the advertisements The final commercial in the series focuses on the Dodge brothers spirit and drive to create a cuttingedge company Their lives were big but their dreams were bigger the commercial states while panning to the newest models of Dodge vehicles One hundred years later this is how their spirit lives on As weve shown the Dodge brothers spent only a few years at the helm of their vehicle manufacturing business Since that time the company has undergone significant changes and more than one acquisition After the brothers deaths in the company was sold to Dillon Read Co for million Auto Evolution reports Just three years later the company underwent another transformation when it was acquired by Chrysler Corporation Although its plausible that the brothers way of thinking and presence is considered when creating new Dodge vehicles with the evolution of the company and its vehicles it may be difficultto hold onto the same motivation held by the founders nearly years ago In a way its much like McDonalds which owes its name to the McDonald brothers who opened the first restaurants but owes its legacy to Ray Kroc On one hand the Dodge Brothers commercials do their job of trying to make people want to buy Dodges At the same time the omit some very important facts about the companys timeline in an effort to establish historical connections that are at best a stretch Then again advertisements only run between to seconds and we cant reasonably expect the advertiser to include every relevant piece of information about its history so perhaps this is a case of picking nits While certain omissions and the presentation of the Dodge models through the years arent exactly rooted in the complete truth it doesnt look like the company was attempting to maliciously mislead consumers
