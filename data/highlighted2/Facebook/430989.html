class='textDiv'>The EU Is Coming To Close Down Your Free Speech Zero Hedge by Secular Investor Jun AM by Phoenix Capital Jun PM Submitted by Douglas Murray via The Gatestone Institute The German Chancellor was not interested in the reinforcement of Europes external borders the reerection of its internal borders the institution of a workable asylum vetting system and the repatriation of people who had lied to gain entry into Europe Instead Chancellor Merkel wanted to know how Facebooks founder could help her restrict the free speech of Europeans on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and on other social media Then on May the European Union announced a new online speech code to be enforced by four major tech companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and YouTube It was clear from the outset that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a definitional problem as well as a political bias in deciding on these targets What is Facebooks definition of racism What is its definition of xenophobia What come to that is its definition of hate speech Of course the EU is a government and an unelected government at that so its desire not just to avoid replying to its critics but to criminalise their views and ban their contrary expressions is as bad as the government of any country banning or criminalising the expression of opinion which is not adulatory of the government People must speak up must speak up now and must speak up fast in support of freedom of speech before it is taken away from them It is sadly not an overstatement to say that our entire future depends on it It is nine months since Angela Merkel and Mark Zuckerberg tried to solve Europes migrant crisis Of course having caused the migrant crisis by announcing the doors of Europe as open to the entire thirdworld Angela Merkel particularly would have been in a good position actually to try to solve this crisis But the German Chancellor was not interested in the reinforcement of Europes external borders the reerection of its internal borders the institution of a workable asylum vetting system and the repatriation of people who had lied to gain entry into Europe Instead Chancellor Merkel was interested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>When seated with Mark Zuckerberg Frau Merkel wanted to know how the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>founder could help her restrict the free speech of Europeans on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and on other social media Speaking to Zuckerberg at a UN summit last September and not aware that the microphones were picking her up she asked what could be done to restrict people writing things on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which were critical of her migration policy Are you working on this she asked him Yeah Zuckerberg replied In the months that followed we learned that this was not idle chatter over lunch In January of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>launched its Initiative for civil courage online committing a million Euros to fund nongovernmental organisations in its work to counter racist and xenophobic posts online It also promised to remove hate speech and expressions of xenophobia from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>website It was clear from the outset that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a definitional problem as well as a political bias in deciding on these targets What is Facebooks definition of racism What is its definition of xenophobia What come to that is its definition of hate speech As for the political bias why had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>not previously considered how for instance to stifle expressions of openborders sentiments on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>There are many people in Europe who have argued that the world should have no borders and that Europe in particular should be able to be lived in by anyone who so wishes Why have people expressing such views on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and there are many not found their views censored and their posts removed Are such views not extreme One problem with this whole area and a problem which has clearly not occurred to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is that these are questions which do not even have the same answer from country to country Any informed thinker on politics knows that there are laws that apply in some countries that do not and often should not apply in others Contrary to the views of many transnational progressives the world does not have one set of universal laws and certainly does not have universal customs Hatespeech laws are to a very great extent an enforcement of the realm of customs As such it is unwise to enforce policies on one country from another country without at least a very deep understanding of that countrys traditions and laws Societies have their own histories and their own attitudes towards their most sensitive matters For instance in Germany France the Netherlands and some other European countries there are laws on the statute books relating to the publication of Nazi materials and the propagation of material praising or even representing Adolf Hitler or denying the Holocaust The German laws forbidding largescale photographic representations of Hitler may look ridiculous from London but may look less ridiculous from Berlin Certainly it would take an enormously selfconfident Londoner unilaterally to prescribe a policy to change this German law To understand things which are forbidden or able to be forbidden in a society you would have to have an enormous confidence in your understanding of that countrys taboos and history as well as its speech codes and speech laws A ban on the veneration of communist idols for instance may seem sensible tasteful or even desirable in one of the many countries which suffered under communism wish to minimise the suffering of the victims and prevent the resurrection of such an ideology Yet a universal ban on images or texts which extolled the communist murderers of tens of millions of people would also make criminals of the thousands of Westerners notably Americans who enjoy wearing Che Guevara Tshirts or continue their adolescent fantasy that Fidel Castro is an icon of freedom Free societies generally have to permit the widest possible array of opinion But they will have different ideas of where legitimate expression ends and where incitement begins So for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and others to draw up their own attempt at a unilateral policy of what constitutes hatespeech would be presumptuous even if it were not as it is clearly politically biased from the outset So it is especially lamentable that this movement to an enforced hatespeech code gained additional force on May when the European Union announced a new online speech code to be enforced by four major tech companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and YouTube Of course the EU is a government and an unelected government at that so its desire not just to avoid replying to its critics but to criminalise their views and ban their contrary expressions is as bad as the government of any country banning or criminalising the expression of opinion which is not adulatory of the government That these are not abstract issues but ones exceedingly close to home has been proven as though it needed proving by the decision of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to suspend the account of Gatestones Swedish expert Ingrid Carlqvist In the last year Sweden took in between and additional people to its population Similar numbers are expected this year As anyone who has studied the situation will know this is a society heading towards a breakdown of its own creation caused at the most benign interpretation by its own openhearted liberalism Countries with welfare models such as Swedens cannot take in such numbers of people without major financial challenges And societies with a poor integration history cannot possibly integrate such vast numbers of people when they come at such speed As anyone who has travelled around there can tell Sweden is a country under enormous and growing strain There is a phase in waking up to such change which constitutes denial The EU the Swedish government and a vast majority of the Swedish press have no desire to hear critiques of a policy which they have created or applauded the consequences will one day be laid at their door and they wish to postpone that day even indefinitely So instead of tackling the fire they started they have decided to attack those who are pointing to the fact that they have set the building they are standing in on fire In such a situation it becomes not just a right but a duty of free people to point out facts even if other people might not want to hear them Only a country sliding towards autocracy and chaos with a governing class intent on avoiding blame could possibly allow the silencing of the few people pointing out what they can clearly see in front of them People must speak up and speak up now and speak up fast in support of freedom of speech before it is taken away from them and in support of journalists such as Carlqvist and against the authorities who would silence all of us It is sadly not an overstatement to say that our entire future depends on it Xenophobia chase the white Christian down the street for daring to defend his woman kill him rape his woman then eat his dead corpse Ignatius Artemis Rand Lives Jun AM Wow youve been a member of ZH for less than hours and youre already trying to incite race war These immigrant invasions are designed to destabilize Europe et al so if youre not a plant then youre doing one hell of a job imitating an eggplant Artemis Rand Lives Ignatius Jun AM Dumbfuck Listen to me dumbfuck I was on here for a few years before I got kicked off by one of you tolerant liberals so go fuck yourself These immigrant invasions are designed to destabilize Europe et al so if youre not a plant then youre doing one hell of a job imitating an eggplant WTFUD Shemp Victory Jun AM Ghordius atthelake Jun AM I would have stated you are likely to be a grandmother that looks at childrens photos or a mother or a child but ok When will Russia or some Russians or someone in Iceland create a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>competitor allowing Free Speech Put the servers in Iceland There has to be some good programmers in more enlightened places like Iceland Russia Czech Republic and maybe Hungary Programmers in different countries have done various versions of Linux with no real money Why not a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>killer F Zuckerberg I want to see Zuckerberg get Fed over Come on Vlad or Kaspersky You will get users i get sick when I see conservatives or Christians using FarceBook On a German language string I wanted to post the sentence in German If you are looking for information you cannot go past guardian and RT Your comment failed to post it said I left out RT only this one change and it was accepted Even the mentioning of RT is censored on German networks When I was corresponding with someone about the KohlRegimes frauds I had a reply the prosecutor is awfully quick with confiscating computers What a Trojan Merkel is and Obama of course please Britainleave the EU and help all of the rest of europe break the trance that we need an enormous unelected burocracy to tell us what to think do and say and then tax us up the ass for it aaaand the Gatestone Institute again on its crusade to make Europe safe for the US First Amendment right of saying whatever you want which in the Gatestone Institutes view is of course that all Muslims are all the same and unspoken that Israel is doing everything right Of course the EU is a government this you have to take as an article of faith a dogma its important that you believe that the EU is a government it reinforces this mirroring thing that the EU is something like the US except that it is not its a kind of coop of governments Merkel is the chancellor of Germany and she sits like Cameron and the other ministers of the national governments in the Council which is the one body that steers and initates all things EU and yes she is not elected as Cameron and all the other ministers sure she is elected as Member of Parliament MP but not as chancellor nor is Cameron elected as Prime Minister they both are appointed as government european way of using the word ie as executive by their elected parliaments and yes Merkel has to follow the law ie she has the mandate to uphold the law in this case German law which forbids certain kinds of talk chiefly incitements to violence versus groups and lo and behold every single european country has some kind of law that forbids it that German law is just a bit more specific and detailed its German after all and forbids nazi swastikas too and a few things more but the Gatestone Institute is globalist after all in that interesting American fashion it treats the whole world in the same way in the US there is the st Amendment so the whole world ought to have that standard period so what one of the main reasons why we have something like the EU and will continue to need something like the EU in future is this kind of global megabiz like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>where its easier for european governments to kick them at a EU level instead of tackling them at a national level so yes you see Merkel telling Zuckerberg that he has to do something otherwise the law tells her that she is not doing enough to curb illegal activities in Germany does Merkel have the rest of the european govs behind her in the EU Council of course she has those european laws are not new nor are they in any way particularly controversial here but Douglas Murray of the Gatestone Institute pretends to be partly oblivious about how european laws are he asks What is its definition of xenophobia What come to that is its definition of hate speech Where Mr Murray In the US Or here in Europe If the latter then its actually simple our laws protect groups more then your right to say that all Englishmen are hooligans all Muslims are terrorists all gays are whatever and so on and if you incite to violence against groups you are just that a clear case of a criminal here its our laws our national laws done by elected parliaments Mr Murray based on our constitutions you want the freedom of the st Amendment thats a right you can have wherever the US flag flies like where your Gatestone Institute is headquartered in NY NY USA There you can be antiMuslim as much as you want its not our business meanwhile if you are requesting the extension of the US st Amendment to the whole world then yes you are acting globalist I could ask you why you dont try with China or Russia first but of course since your focus is on antiMuslim propaganda as a support to Zionist propaganda ie Israel is right regardless european countries are much more important so you know what there is support for the EU Council kicking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to stop disregarding our national laws here in europe the sheer action of kicking global megabusinesses alone has support here I know not the American Way of treating them but there you have it aaaand the Gatestone Institute again on its crusade to make Europe safe for the US First Amendment right of saying whatever you want which in the Gatestone Institutes view is of course that all Muslims ara all the same and unspoken that Israel is doing everything right and spoken that criticism of Israels government is Hate Speech meanwhile its an article full of bullshitty little details and sour grapes about the frozen Fcebook account of the Gatestoned Swedish expert but the Gatestone Institute is globalist after all in that interesting American fashion it treats the whole world in the same way in the US there is the st Amendment so the whole world ought to have that standard period Thats just part of the American Way knowing what is best for all people places and cultures and shoving it down their throats for their own good so you know what there is support for the EU Council kicking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to stop disregarding our national laws here in europe the sheer action of kicking global megabusinesses alone has support here I know not the American Way of treating them but there you have it What is it going to take to make you stubborn Europeans bow down and embrace American Exceptionalism Dont make us put you through another war of aggression against Russia because well do it Although Bunds remain below this morning focus continues to Shanghai Composite index preliminary closes down at AUCTION PREVIEW French EUR bln Month TBill Auctions NOTICE We are aware of
