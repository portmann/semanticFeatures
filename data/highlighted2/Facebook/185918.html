Facebooks stock follows a key shareholderfriendly metric The stock is still fairly valued on a DCF basis Facebooks NASDAQ FB stock correlates well with free cash flow FCF Free cash flow is considered shareholderfriendly because it is the money available to repurchase stock reinvest in the business and pay dividends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt pay dividends but it has done buybacks and reinvested in the business Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still in a high growth phase it chooses to forgo paying a dividend and reinvest in the business This is positive for shareholders as this leads to aboveaverage gains in revenue and earnings which leads to higher stock prices For the first two quarters of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had about billion in free cash flow This means the company is on pace to have about billion in FCF for the year This would be about higher than last years FCF of billion So with the correlation between the stock price and FCF I would expect the stock to continue to rise Facebooks valuation still looks fairly valued on a discounted cash flow basis I calculated the intrinsic value of the stock by using the companys WACC of as the discount rate If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can grow its FCF at annually in line with consensus estimates for the next five years annually for years to and annually thereafter the stock has an intrinsic value of about This is a few dollars higher than the current price At this valuation I think that the stock can continue to grow approximately in line with its FCF growth over the long term The companys PEG based on year projected earnings growth is This reinforces the stocks fair valuation Some investors might be turned off by the trailing PE of or the forward PE of These metrics only look back and forward one year So the PEG is a better measure as it accounts for multiple years of growth The stock should perform well because of Facebooks strong aboveaverage revenue earnings and FCF growth The PEG is a more refined valuation measure for such a highgrowth company With the PEG between one and two the stock is fairly valued in terms of its year projected earnings growth The bottom line for Facebooks valuation is that the stock is fairly valued in terms of longterm earnings and FCF growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still achieving strong doubledigit gains in daily and active monthly users This is being converted into increased revenue growth as advertising continues to grow I think that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future since many people like to stay in touch with their friends and family and post information that is funny political religious inspiring or just updates on what they are doing or what is important to them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also has strong growth potential with the consumer version of the Oculus Rift being released next year There are numerous uses for this device The immediate use will be for virtual reality gaming However there are numerous applications that are likely to use this technology For example viewing movies at home or even in theaters is a likely use I could see special theaters equipped with Oculus Rifts to allow for virtual reality movie experiences Viewing sports with the Rift could make viewers feel like they are present at the game with perfect seats Medical students could perform surgery in simulation mode before actually touching a body Exercising could turn into gaming with the Rift Users could play virtual reality games or have the experience of traveling on a scenic trail while riding a treadmill or stationary bike It would be reasonable to assume that the Rift will be used for driving and flying simulation to provide education and experience before users hit the road or the air The bottom line is that the Oculus Rift is likely to produce a significant amount of future revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a good riskreward investment for the long term The current advertising business still has plenty of room to grow The numerous uses for the Oculus Rift make it likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will experience strong aboveaverage growth for many years The stocks fair valuation makes it likely that the stock will continue to increase approximately in line with free cash flow growth going forward Since revenue earnings and free cash flow are likely to increase at an aboveaverage pace I expect the stock to outperform the market over the long term We only use your
