seasonality services are arbitrary and useless to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors Still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shows a seasonal pattern An autumn sprint followed by a winter hibernation I was reading your last article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and for the most part agree with your analysis and outlook Im curious if you factor seasonality into your analysis For example when I look at the seasonality for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on Financhill I see that it is due to fall by over the next weeks Prior to this message I had not even heard of Financhill But after looking at the seasonality section of the site I found my suspicious to be true Its a black box site I am not against automated stock analysis services but I am against those services that hide their inner workings Financhill indeed shows FB to fall in the coming weeks but based on what factors A look at the chart shows a prediction curve dotted lines This alone should be a red flag A prediction of this sort implies a model that uses overfitting A model that is overfit looks good from a numerical standpoint but almost always fails moving forward That is the model works on historical data because it is trained on historical data but the model does not imply anything of statistical significance The week period is arbitrary and has no fundamental basis Seasonality is only seasonality if it contains an underlying fundamental cause That cause could be related to the weather as in agricultural stocks or investor psychology as in the Sell in May phenomenon That is seasonality is only relevant when it is based on something Otherwise the chosen time segments are arbitrary So my first response to Whitney is to ignore Financhills seasonality predictions they have no basis and are black boxbased Now to Whitneys second question Whether seasonality is a factor in Facebooks stock As I have shown in many articles earnings periods are great times to break up stocks in a search for alpharich earnings For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I intend to do the same H <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock shows no statistically significant stock growth difference during different earnings seasons We will have four alternative hypotheses one for each quarter Since the inception of FB the buyandhold strategy has outperformed the SPDR SP ETF NYSEARCA SPY by Thus a random threemonth period of holding FB should produce a total return of Hence we must see returns significantly different than for a strategy that employs holding during a certain earnings period I ran this test and found significant differences for two earnings periods The numbers you will see in the charts below show the cumulative returns for holding FB for a single earnings period per year every year The significantly different earnings periods should be obvious Clearly Q and Q were significantly different than the average Q and Q returns Unlike many stocks which are evenly weighted across the year FB sees outperformance during Q and underperformance during Q Think of it like an autumn sprint that requires a winter hibernation This provides us with a FB hold strategy that possibly surpasses standard buyandhold What if we avoided the worst quarter Q Would our gains exceed those of buy and hold The chart below shows the results of this strategy compared with standard buyandhold as well as holding the SPY This seasonal strategy far surpasses the other two despite freeing up three months worth of funds The seasonal strategy is better than holding FB and better than holding the SPY It also is a less volatile strategy than holding FB rarely do less volatile investments outperform more stable investments Weve also naturally cut down on our average drawdown by Would a addition to your gains be worth switching from capital gains returns to income tax returns For the majority of investors the answer is yes Investors interested in the seasonality of FB have little reason not to sell FB at the end of the year buying back in April The seasonal pattern of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is as interesting as it is profitable While an underperformance in Q is hard to explain an exceptional Q is easier to explain As an exmarketer I know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the goto source to place ads for consumers In fact I have a saying If it doesnt convert on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it wont convert anywhere In my experience ads on sites such as LinkedIn NYSE LNKD and Twitter NYSE TWTR never get the ROI that ads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>get one exception is YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL ads which Ive found to work great for infomarketing products but not so well for products With Q containing the holiday season online ads are ramped up Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>uses a bidding system for its ads competition increases increasing the cost of ads Seasonal keywords such as Christmas gifts become highly targeted and a seasonal opportunity for extra revenue Many large companies rely on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for online ads during the holiday season Some of Facebooks largest clients include seasonal consumer product companies such as Nike NYSE NKE Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX and Disney NYSE DIS For these companies budget is no problem and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>sees a sudden influx of nonstingy marketers competing for timely keywords Still the possible reasons for evading Q elude me Perhaps readers have their own theories Feel free to post them in the comments section below Reducing your exposure to FB during Q is a worthwhile strategy despite the tax implications First the strategy outperforms buyandhold to such an extent that the conversion of capital gains earnings to income earnings only takes a small bite out of the overall profits Second the selling of FB at the end of Q and the buyback at the beginning of Q allows investors to sell the peak and buy the dip ultimately earning themselves more shares for the same amount of capital Third the strategy opens up months to grow your FB capital whether safely through bonds or more aggressively through equity hopefully one that statistically performs well in Q Alternatively you can apply the above results without actually leaving the buyandhold strategy Many investors refuse to sell FB for whatever reason or excuse Too much work I want the capital gains or I dont believe in statistics and you cannot time the market These investors can at least hedge their FB position by recognizing the strong possibility FB will underperform in late winter How An options strategy opened on FB during Q can hedge your FB position I can think of at least ten options strategies that will work well with FB Each has its own use and riskreward profile for example a credit spread works well for highly volatile stocks that begin a slow trend downward For the sake of practicality I will recommend a bear debit spread which limits the damage of time decay yet puts us in a profitable position for a bearish move Buy to open FB strike April put Sell to open FB strike April put The above strategy should cost you roughly The theta is nearly for such a strategy meaning that you wont be losing money on the strategy through time decay In addition delta should be giving you a gain for every fall in FBs strike price Soon I will be launching my Exploiting Earnings premium subscription here on Seeking
