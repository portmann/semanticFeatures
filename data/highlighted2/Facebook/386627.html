race Effective sameday delivery is kind of the holy grail of online retail right now being able to get your hands on that thing you need right now when you need it is the one advantage brickandmortar stores still have and its the one Amazon in particular wants to chip away at The list of cities where Amazon promises Prime subscribers access to sameday delivery keeps getting longer but theres a snag not all addresses within a city are considered equal and the pattern to the areas without access looks distressingly familiar It makes sense that not every single ZIP code out there can be equally reached by sameday delivery services Some cities are large and sprawling and complicated sure and even in the more compact ones there might be some roads that are just tricky to take a truck down Warehouses might be juuuuuuust out of range for the farflung corners of a metropolis Exceptions will always happen But reporters at Bloomberg went looking at those exceptions and what they found in many of the nations biggest cities isnt just haphazard its a pattern with a clear and troubling correlation to hand For example those exceptions makes a lot less sense when the nogo zone is one tiny little island in the middle of a geographically compact city as in the Roxbury area of Boston perhaps Bloombergs most immediately egregious example Bloombergs map of Amazon Prime sameday delivery in Boston Likewise the map of our nations capital designed from the start as only ten miles on a side and since even smaller has a rather abrupt demarcation in it Bloombergs map of Amazon Prime sameday delivery in DC And what do Roxbury and Southeast DC have in common Theyre the areas of their home cities with the highest concentration of black residents What has happened in both of those cities Bloomberg found as well as in Chicago Dallas Atlanta and New York is that those little pockets or glaring lines where sameday delivery is unavailable correlate very neatly to the pockets or glaring lines of the neighborhoods racial makeup as reported on the census Amazons certainly not doing it on purpose no one is sitting around their office in Seattle twirling a handlebar mustache while brandishing a cigar and exclaiming I know Racism Instead its a problem weve seen before when an algorithm or a computer or a human wielding those tools uses proxy data like ZIP code and income correlations what it often ends up with is a big fat pile of unintentional but still present racial bias Amazon tells Bloomberg that its plan in each city it goes to is to start out small where theres already a high concentration of Prime members and then end up getting big as they expand the program which makes a perfect amount of sense from Amazons point of view But there are a lot of cities including these six where highest number of existing subscribers is probably going to correlate to wealthiest areas which also tends to correlate to whitest areas In other words customers who behind a screen are all anonymous and who live mere yards from each other are still treated differently under the data A Washington DC area Prime customer who lives in one of the neighborhoods without sameday delivery tells Bloomberg I still get twoday shipping but none of the superfast convenient delivery services come here If you bring that service to the city you should offer it to the whole city Bloombergs interactive map of race vs Prime sameday access in Chicago Theres a lot of segregation in most American cities still neighborhoods and therefore the ZIP codes that define them in databases dont necessarily see a lot of black and white families living side by side That allows for high concentrations of pretty much any data point in one kind of ZIP code or another and if you dont have eyes inside the company any company specifically looking for it its a pattern you may not see until its already done Or as the DC customer put it to Bloomberg They Amazon are offering different services to other people who dont look like you but live in the same city and so long as the effect continues to exist the cause doesnt really matter Amazon Now Delivering Restaurant Food In Seattle
