just given birth to a daughter Max but the real highlight of the letter is the part in the text in which he discloses that in order to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation Zuckerberg begins the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and that in order to advance this mission Zuckerberg will give of his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares currently worth billion to advance this mission Today your mother and I are committing to spend our lives doing our small part to help solve these challenges I will continue to serve as Facebooks CEO for many many years to come but these issues are too important to wait until you or we are older to begin this work By starting at a young age we hope to see compounding benefits throughout our lives As you begin the next generation of the Chan Zuckerberg family we also begin the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to join people across the world to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation Our initial areas of focus will be personalised learning curing disease connecting people and building strong communities We will give of our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares currently about billion during our lives to advance this mission We know this is a small contribution compared to all the resources and talents of those already working on these issues But we want to do what we can working alongside many others For the sake of human potential and equality of children everywhere we for one hope that the value of the shares held by the proud new father retain their value in perpetuity and that billions of people around the world do everything in their power to preserve their own <span

they possibly can doing what they must for the sake of human betterment clicking on ads Tue johngaltfla FB BS TRANSLATOR He has inside information that the market is about to crash and hes going to fuck everyone he can on the way to his survival island Superficial prone to surveillance and worthless to the user Tue pods Normally you have to create the Foundation first and then dump the proceeds of crime into it like the Clintons did I guess it takes longer to avoid taxes when you already have the money Tue Buckaroo Banzai What sickens me about this is the Cultural Marxists will get ahold of this foundation just like they got hold of most of the other big foundations to fund their evil purposes The Ford Foundation is the poster child for this shit Look at all the progressive code words you can find on their website Tue Save_Americast so the global NWO elitists created this little fag just like they did Bill Gates in order to lead the masses right into their traps They gave him what Fraudbook became and allowed him to become some sort of geek child celebrity just like Bill Gates and allowed him to reap Billions while being the face and socalled creator of Fraudbook essesntially a fucking marketing and spy system database for sheeptards And so this is obvioulsy the same deal as Bill Gates got who was already wealthy anyways by his sellout eugenicist dad Once theyve made their Billions they will act and be billed as the saviors of humanity by the govscum and traitor media and willfully be the Judas Goats to lead all the sheeptards to government tyranny and slaughter They will give their Billions away for the benefit of humanity and will go down in revisionist history as little fucking angels Sure this fraudulent little fuck head will get to keep sounds like hes going to be living in back alleys sleeping under cardboard boxes completely destitute right The sheeptards would think so because they have no clue what somebody with of Billion dollars actually has left over Million This asshole will be preaching eugenics global warming antiwhite racism and all kinds of antiConstitutional bullshit from coast to coast and will do or say anything for the NWO that they want him to for the rest of his worthless life Tue SoilMyselfRotten Tue MANvsMACHINE Tue J S Bach Tue Divided States Tue bunzbunzbunz yeahor he is getting to the age where he realizes he is mortal and most of the money means nothing so maybe juuuust maybe he wants to try to help people in reality i think he probably wants to market himself as a good person to make himself and his family less of a target to psycho fucks that actually believe he is an enemy of humanity Tue Stainless Steel Rat I want my great great great grandkids not to be walmarts serfs living paycheck to paycheck in a company owned apartment complex I imagine that when their generation comes about land will be in the hands of about five landlords I was just thinking about how much of a pussy he is If he really REALLY wants to help humanity he would donate of his shares and go and live in a van down by the river TY Chris Farley Tue Goof Tue Lost My Shorts Actually Foundation is even more clever It becomes the prime customer for your new ventures Personalised learning is a euphemism for sticking school children in front of computers where they will be taught by expensive software sold by a forlotsaprofit company in which Fzuck is a ground floor investor So you can pose as a doogooder and dodge taxes while funneling the money back to yourself Tue aVileRat What I find incredible is that Zuck is just repeating the CarnigieDuPontRockefellerGatesBuffettMorgan strategy of entrusting your assets installing your children as managers and thus preventing the govt from ever taking your wealth People will see him for generations as a visionary when in reality Zuckerburg is simply ring fencing his own assets from the future capital gain bill wealth taxes which will affect the rest of the Tue Ignatius If he really wanted to help hed use his money to buy a few simple political solutions Ironic I know but use his money to get concentrated corporate wealth out of the political system as an example But youre right pods hes likely just sheltering it like that giant turd Gates and his foundation Tue Implied Violins He had to transition from baby eating to baby creating Many oligarchs have trouble with that stepor combine the two Tue Charming Anarchist Yes and just like BitCoin the FaceBook infrastructure has a lot of potential to be used for good shit but alas untrustworthy I have a different take on this news I do not have the mental capacity to appreciate what Billion represents It means as much as telling me that the Sun is Million miles away Those ridiculously astronomic numbers are out of my league of comprehension My caveman brain tells me to go with my gut and my gut tells me this is all theater hiding some other shit When I first delved into FaceBook I dreamed of the day where FaceBook would be the CostCo of the legal security and financial worlds I reckoned that FaceBook would put all lawyers out of business by offering Click Here formal business employment and marriage contracts Nope I reckoned FaceBook would offer cheap dispute resolution services Nope I reckoned FaceBook would offer life disablity medical dental car and property insurance packages to its customers Nope Nope Nope The sky is the limit to how FaceBook can offer cheap freedom to folks Yet it is nothing put nefarious bullshit Tue greenskeeper carl i dont think you need inside information to know that all of this isnt going to end well Anyone paying attention should be able to tell you that As to the rest of it fuck you zuckerburg You made your billions encouraging these young people you claim to care about waste their fucking lives sitting on your dumbass site A whole generation of selfie taking narcicists ignoring each other in social settings while goofing off on their phones You made your money selling ads to these same people activiely encouraging them to sepnd mony they dont have on shit they dont need This has to be one of the most glaring examples of blatant hypocracy Ive ever seen Your daughters and mines generation will be worse off than mine which is worse than my parents because of progressive fucks like you Fuck you fuck off now you did it FB is going to data mine your ass and delete your FB page just to show you whose boss I feel your pain man Tue greenskeeper carl Tue boattrash But I liken this to a Motorcycle Club called gang by some They occasionally bring in Prospects not yet fullpatch members but if they play their cards right for the club they can become members With Facefuck being a backdrop for Govt data mining Snookerberg has joined Tue beemasters Tue The Greek horse Suckerburg what a genius right He stole the idea from the twins in his college days AOL Myspace what now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>please this is a CIANSA experiment to keep big brother always in OUR homes Steve Jobs was a real genius with technological breakthrough for computer dummies like me Suckerburg just dumb ed down civilization FB has NO true value maybe this jerk off might be in for the short of the century Tue golden kafir Tue SixIsNinE the uber wealthy always have ways to structure their so as to gain favor from positive corporate media owners by their crony ilk Remember Gates was said to have over billion in ish which during the s he couldve played blind pinyata stock picking and become a trillionaire easily but it was always reported that his wealth stayed in the half billion range forever thats because he STRUCTURED it so it is NOT public knowledge if hes got to be worth many Trillz by now Tue Lorcas Novena Once the see eye a is done with his program which Im sure they are abot there the stock will retrace to where it should be and that is on the OTC Tue Miffed Microbio Tue Urban Redneck Hell no they want to get all the money into that nonprofit tax shelterslush fund ASAP before the US government goes Greek on the USSA serfs Tue KirkNCC What is this are we expecting the imminent return of the Almighty or space alien Overlords that these people are trying to suck up to in a preemptive move s Funny but there will be a part TV series on Dec on the SciFi channel based on Arthur C Clarkes classic novel Childhoods End Lt Uhura do you have any communication from Karellen No Hmmm Tue venturen let me guess the donation will involve a foundation that is taxfree and will support every aspect of their offspring lifestyle Kind of like the rockefeller foundation Pays the CEO and others millions from TAX FREE SCAM Tue pods Tue Dick Buttkiss Say what you will about Zuckerbergs move income taxes are an abomination and along with the Federal Reserve both became law in have been two of the most virulent forces of our nations destruction Tue sgt_doom As did the oil depletion allowance and the financial structure of foundations and trusts allowing for the hiding of ownership and the sheltering of stocks and bonds to avoid taxation and hostile takeover of said stocks FYI When Rockefeller was supposed to break up his Standard Oil what he had his lawyers and accountants do instead was to create various foundations then create holding companies shift his stocks to those and move the ownership of said holding companies to his various foundations One of the dudes responsible for this and credited with the creation of the first holding company was Thomas Scott later to become the Secretary of War under Lincoln and the mentor of a guy named Andrew Carnegie so a Rockefeller stooge mentored Carnegie which is probably why there today exists an Andrew Carnegie Rockefeller now guess who this dude is descended from Tue Dick Buttkiss The same goes for centralized fractionalreserve banking Tue layman_please the tax free foundations are the primary link to influence education science policy media etc its as much about transferring wealth as about reprogramming the culture thats where zuckerbergs shares are going to be used thats the real power compared to the money which is just a mean to the purpose of controlling the society in general zuckerbergs clintons and gates are new money carroll quigley wrote about the old money from the wall street mainly dominated by the jp morgan et al that established full control over many aspects of life ivy league media left wing parties etc in america already in the s Because of its dominant position in Wall Street the Morgan firm came also to dominate other Wall Street powers such as Carnegie Whitney Vanderbilt BrownHarriman or DillonReed Close alliances were made with Rockefeller Mellon and Duke interests but not nearly so intimate ones with the great industrial powers like du Pont and Ford Because of the great influence of this Wall Street alignment an influence great enough to merit the name of the American Establishment this group could control the Federal government and in consequence had to adjust to a good many government actions which they had secretly supported The chief of these were in taxation law beginning with the graduated income tax in but culminating above all else in the inheritance tax These tax laws drove the great private fortunes dominated by Wall Street into taxexempt foundations which became a major link in the Establishment network between Wall Street the Ivy League and the Federal government Dean Rusk Secretary of State after formerly president of the Rockefeller Foundation and Rhodes Scholar at Oxford is as much a member of this nexus as Alger Hiss the Dulles brothers Jerome Greene James T Shotwell John W Davis Elihu Root or Philip Jessup The Eastern Establishment in the US Behind this unfortunate situation lies another more profound relationship which influences matters much broader than Far Eastern policy It involves the organization of taxexempt fortunes of international financiers into foundations to be used for educational scientific and other public purposes Sixty or more years ago public life in the West was dominated by the influence of Wall Street This term has nothing to do with its use by the Communists to mean monopolistic industrialism but on the contrary refers to international financial capitalism deeply involved in the gold standard foreign exchange fluctuations floating of fixedinterest securities and to a lesser extent flotation of industrial shares for stockexchange markets This group which in the United States was completely dominated by J P Morgan and Company from the s to the s was cosmopolitan Anglophile internationalist Ivy League eastern seaboard high Episcopalian and Europeanculture conscious Their connection with the Ivy League colleges rested on the fact that the large endowments of these institutions required constant consultation with the financiers of Wall Street or its lesser branches on State Street Boston and elsewhere and was reflected in the fact that these endowments even in were largely in bonds rather than in real estate or common stocks As a consequence of these influences as late as the s J P Morgan and his associates were the most significant figures in policy making at Harvard Columbia and to a lesser extent Yale while the Whitneys were significant at Yale and the Prudential Insurance Company
