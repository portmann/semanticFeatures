messaging and video demonstrate the brilliance of CEO Mark Zuckerberg Time to stop making excuses not to own it Traders asked about the stock say they owned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB for a while saw a profit got out and now regret it No company this decade is so wellrun or looks better poised to continue going forward I admit to having been an idiot I seldom use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>At Im not in the target demographic and my kids while in their mids dont focus on it either I generally dont like to own companies I dont use and fully understand but in this case it is time to make an exception The companys latest moves encrypting its WhatsApp messaging platform endtoend and the addition of a video tab highlighting its video offerings are great examples of this The first puts the service ahead of even Apple NASDAQ AAPL in the encryption struggle with governments around the world Since WhatsApp is focused on mobile it should quickly become a primary tool for spreading news inside Turkey for getting the facts of the Panama Papers through the Great Firewall of China and for sticking it to the Obama Administration and its national security apparatus For the companys global audience and WhatsApp has billion users its a winwinwin But thats not the big news The big news is CEO Mark Zuckerbergs latest obsession live video There are lots of players here but only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the dedicated cloud infrastructure and the mobile user base needed to get there first and monetize it As I have written elsewhere TV has two huge advantages over text once the bit traffic headroom is dealt with First its cheaper to put some talking heads in front of a camera than it is to actually think write and edit something coherent It takes less time Second the amount of TV ad inventory is inherently limited Because its linear you cant pile a lot of ads on a video stream as you can with text You can demand full attention as well This is a company with yearoveryear revenue growth of and margins that actually rise with time because costs drop to nearzero once an app is deployed into the cloud Zuckerberg is much more tightly focused on the needsanddesires of todays user base than anyone else in tech he has the power to act and he acts Sometimes its impulsive and sometimes it doesnt work <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has done acquisitions under his leadership but his batting average is better than any venture capitalist I know of The risk is that the leadership team is thin There are just five managers listed on its Web site and eight directors three of them insiders The only adult in the room is director Erskine Bowles a Clinton and Obama Administration insider who is also the lead independent director at Morgan Stanley NYSE MS This is why rumors that COO Sheryl Sandberg might leave to become CEO of Disney NYSE DIS which believe it or not has half the market cap of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>today are of concern But Zuckerberg has built a cadre of likeminded associates like Chris Cox Cox is with similar backgrounds and tastes to the boss While Cox is listed as chief product officer he has also been head of the companys human resources department and gives talks to new recruits on the companys mission culture and philosophy If a bus ran over Zuckerberg tomorrow god forbid and Sandberg ran off somewhere Cox would be a fine replacement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>next reports earnings on April with analysts expecting earnings of centsshare and revenue of billion This would be just short of the December quarters cents of earnings of billion in revenue but in line with the previous years seasonal pattern The growth rate justifies the high priceearnings multiple of Of all the socalled FANG stocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the closest to being a blue chip Zuckerberg has proven highly adept at making the big moves first in building out its own cloud infrastructure then to making the right acquisitions and focusing the company on mobile and now in turning to messaging and video Its time to stop making excuses not to own the stock despite its price Its time to buy The Steve Jobs of this
