</span>to find their desired target market The range of potential outcomes with respect to Facebooks valuation is astounding Though its business model doesnt have many comparable stories we do recall a time when AOL was also the Internet With such low barriers to entry the landscape could be completely different in five to ten years posing both risks and opportunities Facebooks monthly active users MAUs and mobile monthly active users are growing at tremendous rates As of the end of MAUs rose to nearly billion and mobile MAUs rose to billion compared to less than million mobile MAUs at the end of In our opinion the best measure of a firms ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firms economic profit spread Facebooks year historical return on invested capital without goodwill is which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of As such we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT The concept of an economic moat or sustainable competitive advantages focuses purely on the sustainability and the duration of the competitive advantages that a firm possesses The concept of an economic moat does not consider the cumulative sum of a firms potential future economic profit creation but only that at some point in time in the future a moaty company will continue to have an economic profit spread and a nomoat firm will not Lets examine the problem that arises by focusing exclusively on companies that have economic moats or sustainable and durable competitive advantages Image Source Valuentum EVA is trademarked by Stern Stewart Co In the chart below we show the probable path of Facebooks ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome in our opinion and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate Firms that generate a free cash flow margin free cash flow divided by total revenue above are usually considered cash cows Facebooks free cash flow margin has averaged about during the past years As such we think the firms cash flow generation is relatively STRONG The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow FCFF which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cash flow from operations increased about from levels registered two years ago while capital expenditures expanded about over the same time period In fiscal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reported cash flow from operations of billion and capital expenditures of billion resulting in free cash flow of billion representing a increase from fiscal This is the most important portion of our analysis Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Facebooks shares are worth between each Shares are currently trading at in the lower half of our fair value range This indicates that we feel there is more upside potential than downside risk associated with shares at this time The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers The estimated fair value of per share represents a pricetoearnings PE ratio of about times last years earnings and an implied EVEBITDA multiple of about times last years EBITDA Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of during the next five years a pace that is lower than the firms year historical compound annual growth rate of Our model reflects a year projected average operating margin of which is above Facebooks trailing year average Beyond year we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of for the next years and in perpetuity For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>we use a weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows Click to enlargeMargin of Safety Analysis Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows Although we estimate the firms fair value at about per share every company has a range of probable fair values thats created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers like future revenue or earnings for example After all if the future was known with certainty we wouldnt see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values In the graph above we show this probable range of fair values for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>We think the firm is attractive below per share the green line but quite expensive above per share the red line The prices that fall along the yellow line which includes our fair value estimate represent a reasonable valuation for the firm in our opinion We estimate Facebooks fair value at this point in time to be about per share As time passes however companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends The chart above compares the firms current share price with the path of Facebooks expected equity value per share over the next three years assuming our longterm projections prove accurate The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year represents our best estimate of the value of the firms shares three years hence This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time should our views on the firms future cash flow potential change The expected fair value of per share in Year represents our existing fair value per share of increased at an annual rate of the firms cost of equity less its dividend yield The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is putting up tremendous revenue growth earnings expansion and
