CPC This is a big deal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for its advertising and marketing partners for content creators and for its investors Ill explain First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now defining CPC to only include clicks to websites and apps and not likes shares and comments Put simply if you take a user off the platform it will be recorded According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>this is intended to help advertisers better understand how their ads perform against their objective which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>deems as driving a business goal such as instore traffic and website clicks I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing this for a few reasons but all that dialin to helping the company obviously drive the bottom line So what does this change in definition do then For starters it will make Facebooks advertisements appear to be more effective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>notes this in its release today Once this change goes into effect advertisers who care about link clicks are likely to see better return on advertising spend since theyll be paying for only the most valuable outcome Separating link clicks from engagement clicks including likes and comments means your budget will be spent more efficiently no matter if you bid for clicks or engagement As a result of this change some campaign reporting metrics related to clicks may look different By excluding likes shares and comments CPC may increase but will also become more valuable as it counts only the clicks you want Similarly it may look like your clickthrough rate NYSE CTR has decreased again this is because the CTR will no longer factor in the additional clicks All told though the actual cost and underlying efficacy of course will remain unchanged and I think that will be fairly transparent to those paying for them The platform is what the platform is But what this can lead to and what this hints are much bigger definitive pivots in the overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>model Separating the two metrics in definable silos can now allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to begin inflating its costs for Link Clicks at accelerated rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now will be able to show in more granularity its direct effect on driving predictable outcomes Thats a very very powerful leverage driver with advertising and marketing partners This is going to become increasingly important as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to shape its platform into a content creation and contentinbound marketing machine Essentially this is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>spent the time developing and creating the final version of Instant Articles Link Clicks will be the white glove product under Facebooks offering umbrella Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>made very careful note that it would also include in Link Click price scheduling when a user clicks a call to action button These are inclusive of buy now buttons app installation buttons and maybe most importantly newsletter and other consistent touchpoint buttons I detailed Facebooks willingness to help drive these recurring touchpoint outcomes for advertisers and marketers just two weeks ago in a research note for Seeking Alpha It appears this wasnt simply a Good Samaritan rollout not that I was thinking that as indicated in my research note I believe shortly it will be scheduled where these clicks are the most expensive for the platform as they should be The other thing that this presumably does is allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a less expensive menu item for SMBs or low adspend businesses that simply want to create awareness rather than an outcome For instance a company looking to build awareness for a product launch would have little use for a Link Click unless taking presales enrollments etc but would have plenty use for a like share or comment all variables that drive awareness for the engaged user and drive News Feed visibility by appearing more attractive to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>algorithm While complete speculation its my guess that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>keeps these clicks at a lower costs as a way to introduce advertisers and marketers to the ecosystem All told an advertising change at one of the biggest companies in the world is a big deal I think this is a big deal in itself but also a big deal in what it means for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>longer term This change directly contributes and positively moves forward my media companycontent marketing bull thesis that Ive shaped for readers over the last few months It also should do well for my longdated CALL options that are up a market pullback inclusive in three weeks of ownership If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can pull off what I think it can by January I should be a lot deeper in the money than Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Alters Its Advertising
