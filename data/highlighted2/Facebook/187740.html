class='textDiv'>Mark Zuckerberg Creates Opportunities To Launch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Theres no denying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is banned in China and for the company to sustain high rates of growth it has to win over Chinese politicians Well Mark Zuckerberg is making progress in that hes met directly with the president of China Xi JinPing twice over the past week Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can make some compromises here and there and it appeals to the political interests of China the company should be able to launch its family of products That would bode well for shareholders as it would add substantial upside to growth assumptions But even without those optimistic circumstances I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a solid buy as theres room for more upside in and So Mark Zuckerberg could be making some headway when it comes to foreign politics as he posted a photo of him attending a dinner with the Chinese President Xi Jinping This is important because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is not in China and the only way for Chinese <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users to gain access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is to use a VPN Going forward however I anticipate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will eventually gain enough political capital to enter the Chinese market so as long as they adhere to strict censorship laws or strike some other compromises when pertaining very specifically to cyber security Mark Zuckerberg also met President Xi Jinping at the eighth annual USChina Internet Industry Forum in Seattle on September rd With various opportunities to meet the Chinese president its likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will eventually win over the Chinese political elite which could be a noteworthy earnings catalyst at some future point in time Having met the president of China twice the probability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>entering into China increases as the president of China is looking to improve US relations and continue the discussion of cybersecurity the Internet and various other political themes that are very standard when two leaders of state meet over dinner Of course the people attending the dinner are Silicon Valley and business elites and from what I can tell this is one of those golden opportunities in which Mark has a much better opportunity to cold approach the Chinese president than via phone or email Marks wife Priscilla Chan is dressed in red as a sign of formality and respect but also her heritage is Chinese Mark Zuckerberg practiced speaking Mandarin so he can intermingle with his inlaws more and used those skills as he attempted a conversation in Mandarin with full fluency with the president of China In a prior article I mentioned that China is going to be a very important theme going forward as I anticipate that the companys growth rate in terms of daily and monthly active users will slow further as the company is going to face saturation issues at around billion monthly active users However saturation becomes less of an issue assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can set up shop in China as it would expand the Internet addressable market to billion users by which would reduce the saturation impact over the foreseeable three years as I project that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could reach an MAU figure of billion over that respective time frame The stock has outperformed the broader market over the month trailing period and as such investors are pricing in a lot of earnings and revenue growth to sustain current pricing levels This implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would need to sustain a fairly high compound annual growth rate and that results will need to be driven by Instagram WhatsApp and market opportunities as well While Im not necessarily pessimistic the market environment hasnt been very conducive to momentum names lately with the exception of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>So good news in terms of China would be unexpected and would drive the stock to even loftier levels Of course thats assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can compete in China and put itself in a position where it can be a truly international platform in which everyone in China can intermingle with the United States and vice versa This all goes back to censorship and whether China has the stomach to deal with further westernization Also US and Chinese relations pertaining to cyber theft hasnt been that good and its also fair to say that the United States government does use social networks as a means to combat terrorism Therefore because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is complicit to the demands of various foreign governments its not exactly clear whether China is going to be very comfortable with data pertaining to Chinese social user accounts stored on US servers Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would have to build data centers in China because it wouldnt be efficient to operate a large network on Facebooks scale without situating the data within China Nonetheless the political friction is there and its why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to be banned in the Chinese mainland However its not like all hope is lost China is moving toward more of a consumptiondriven economy which will eventually result in some political compromise Furthermore opening the virtual borders to social networking could stimulate growth in the Chinese service sector This is because tourism and various other industries would benefit significantly by having an online presence via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>If more people had access to the Chinese via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>there would be much more reason for foreigners to travel to China and for the Chinese to travel outside of the countrys own borders Over the years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>integrated translation directly into status messages so people in foreign countries can interact with one another I would know because I have met foreign exchange students from Germany Netherlands and South Korea and when they go back to their native countries Im still able to interact with their posts as a result of being able to translate status messages within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Going forward I anticipate that this unique feature will appeal very specifically to Chinas political and economic interests Furthermore China cant remain isolated from the remaining G states much less the rest of the world as its on its way to becoming a superpower and as such politicians need to demonstrate openness and collaboration with the international business community to win more political capital within the United Nations and with their own constituency However even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>were granted entry into China the challenges dont end there The company faces an uphill battle with attracting mobile active users onto <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In other words the remaining social networks RenRen NYSE RENN SinaWeibo NASDAQ SINA and WeChat OTCPK TCEHY would have to respond The good news though for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bulls is how fragmented these services are Theyre very focused on certain aspects of social networking whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>tends to pool social accounts into a web of different services Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would inherently have a larger database of social accounts in which users can interact with as people in mainland China can connect to friends and family overseas Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does have an installed base of users in China Admittedly its not clear what the figures are but the number of Chinese users accessing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>via VPN could be a somewhat meaningful figure According to a recent study by Global Web Index there are million Chinese using a VPN service to gain access to censored websites and social networking services Of course there are no figures to clearly establish how many are using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>out of that number and furthermore its not exactly clear how effective Chinas efforts to combat VPNs have been since the beginning of The Chinese market does offer immense value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I anticipate that the total addressable market is around million internet users by The ARPU figure for those users is around to based on APAC Asia Pacific results and is currently growing at a growth rate according to Facebooks most recent annual report Of course the Chinese advertising market is growing much more quickly than the average CAGR of APAC markets By the TAM would be approximately billion million internet users times ARPU The current TAM is approximately billion million internet users times ARPU If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>were to enter into the Chinese social media market it wouldnt be that saturated in terms of users so the actual revenue from Asia Pacific would mostly be driven by India Japan Russia and other Asian markets However the uptake in demand will likely be strong and it will likely impact revenue and earnings more meaningfully by the to time frame I anticipate that Facebooks nonGAAP EPS will grow to in FY when compared to consensus estimates at Im anticipating much lesser earnings growth deceleration than the consensus as I anticipate profitability metrics to improve following an investment year And while revenue could decelerate slightly pricing of ads and engagement metrics will offset the modest deceleration in user acquisition While I acknowledge that these figures are optimistic theyre not inclusive of Chinese impact so I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a buy regardless of whether or not theyre able to expand into China Theres a lot at stake here but its not enough to derail investor sentiment and growth in terms of earnings or sales Hence I continue to recommend the stock and maintain my current price target of
