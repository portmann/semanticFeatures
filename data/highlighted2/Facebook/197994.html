class='textDiv'>VideoNOW And Accelerated Mobile Pages Will Launch Twitters Stock Higher Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti My Janet Yellen Impersonation clicks Right on the heels of the launch of Moments Twitter had a VideoNOW conference At this event it revealed the expansion of Amplify When Chris Sacca said last week Twitter NYSE TWTR was working on a lot of cool new projects at an accelerated speed because of Jack Dorsey I was skeptical because he was spending half of his time at Square I am revoking my hesitations after this weeks product releases Twitter is on a tear and could potentially leapfrog ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB in terms of product innovations This is great because the company will be able to tell a more positive story on this quarters conference call It will have authority in this optimism because of Moments Periscope and the products I will discuss in this article Jack may be the next Steve Jobs if he continues on this impressive path Everyone knew Twitter had enormous potential but the big worry was execution This is no longer an uncertainty In January I wrote an article about how expansions of video would improve the earnings growth of Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It has taken over months but Twitter is finally realizing what I have imagined the company would achieve At the VideoNOW conference Friday TWTR said video had grown X in the past months This growth is still in about the second inning in terms of what its future potential is Remember video is the most engaging content It is times more engaging than photos which are very engaging themselves Tweets with images are times more engaging than tweets without them If you look at the analytics on my account the last column represents the engagement rate for the tweet As you can see the tweet with a picture has an engagement rate about times the other ones without pictures At the conference Twitter stated its promoted tweets combined with its audience platform that works on thirdparty apps allows the firm to reach million unique viewers This is an important stat because some retail investors believe Instagram is bigger than Twitter just because it has more mobile active users If Twitter can reach more people and sell ads to them then it is illogical to say Instagram is bigger As a reader your response to Twitter getting video may be So what Twitter has video <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL already have this feature The reason why this reasoning is incorrect is Twitter videos are more live than other Internet videos Twitter said of video views come in the first minutes after they are posted This makes TWTR the goto place for news content This was why the company acquired Periscope and it is why Periscope will soon be integrated into the timeline where it can be watched without having to click on a link Twitter video got a boost from the ability to now upload videos from a desktop TWTR will still be benefiting from the recent expansion of mobile video uploads on Android in the next few quarters Originally only live video and not prerecorded video was allowed to be uploaded Twitter is also going to be releasing a GIF generator which will likely be used in Moments Twitter also extended its Amplify initiative on Thursday Sixsecond ads will now be dynamically placed in front of videos The revenue split will be with going to the content creator This is more favorable than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and YouTube offer as their splits are with going to the creator I think Twitter did this because it is behind in the video content creation monetization game It is amazing to think that Vine and Periscope which are much younger apps have a more developed video strategy than Twitter itself has I know that those apps are video apps from their creation but Twitter should be becoming a videofocused app since this is the biggest trend in content consumption on the Internet today As you can see from the diagram above Twitter Amplify previously had advertisers make deals with publishers to have ads serviced This still exists but now advertisers will be able to choose a category of videos to service ads in front of This is much easier and will be used by many more advertisers I find it weird that TWTR unveiled Amplify in this order It makes more sense for the easytouse dynamic ads to be released first since it is how most ads will be run Part of the reason why this order may have happened was because of Niche Niche brings together advertisers and content creators who are popular on platforms such as Vine Twitter and YouTube Niche has content creators who combine for over billion views When I logged into Niche Periscope wasnt offered as a social media account to connect with This should be coming within the next months If Niche can monetize second Vine videos then it will have no problem with Periscope streams which last several minutes and have both live and recorded viewers As you can see below Twitter has publishers already onboard with the new Amplify offering Sports is exciting because of its live nature Twitter is the perfect social media to share this type of content The NFL said its Twitter engagement rate on its tweets was As you saw from my tweets above I have reasons to be jealous about this outstanding engagement rate Twitters partnership with TV is important because the networks must realize that TWTR is not a competitive threat it is a platform that can enhance viewership Twitter will create moments for TV events which will encourage users to have a conversation about the show in realtime Shows such as the Bachelor in Paradise After Paradise already answered tweets using hashtags to organize them live on the show They will now use Moments to get the best content from Twitter There is no more sifting through tweets Twitter is doing the curation for them It is important to compare Twitters video monetization model to Facebooks to see which one will be more successful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shows ads in a differentiated way It shows ads after a user clicks on a suggested video This prevents ads from autoplaying without sound The negative to this format is it doesnt show ads to the users who dont click on another video Twitter shows preroll ads just like YouTube does This is a problem on desktop because if you scroll through a video by the time you click on it to hear the sound half of the ad is already over This is the problem with autoplay video Advertisers will likely be put off by this On mobile users have to tap on the video to engage the video player They see the entire ad with sound Its difficult to say which method will work out better but if one method is superior the firm that isnt using it should have no problem switching One obvious improvement to Twitter ads is the ability to engage with the ad If it adds this calltoaction button in the ads like YouTube has it will be able to earn more money One issue I hope TWTR does better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at is the prevention of freebooting On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users were stealing YouTube videos and reuploading them to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>This boosted Facebooks video views artificially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is instituting a way to stop this which is currently in beta mode As Twitter expands with video it must be sure it has the correct software to prevent this Twitter will have less of a problem because it only allows for seconds but it is still an issue On a side note since Twitter allows the NFL to upload videos longer than seconds I dont see why it limits regular users to this arbitrary length Being against extending the length of regular tweets makes sense because they would take up more room but video players are the same size on the timeline no matter how long they are Recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>launched instant articles which allowed publishers to post articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The articles loaded instantly instead of forcing the user to wait a few seconds for a slow mobile website to load Twitter unveiled a similar service with the open source Accelerated Mobile Pages AMP Project Publishers such as BBC Mashable The Wall Street Journal Buzzfeed and Daily Mail have already signed up It is critically important for Twitter to match <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in the area of news since this is TWTRs bread and butter Twitter has already the edge in the breaking news category because of its speed it needs to make sure it excels in all types of articles I think the tone of my article last week was too skeptical Jack has proven he can work at Square and Twitter at the same time He proved this to the board and has now proved this to investors with this weeks product launches Jack is correct to focus on video as Twitter was extremely weak in this area compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Snapchat Pending CHAT I am excited as both an investor and a user to see what he plans to do to integrate Periscope into timelines With the launch of Moments and AMP the expansion of Amplify and the naming of Jack Dorsey as the
