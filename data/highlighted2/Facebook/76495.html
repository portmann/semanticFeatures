class='textDiv'>Why Would You Underestimate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha It seems that even with ample notice of an investment year taking place some investors think this could be the end of Facebooks growth story When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has invested such as in mobile it has proven that it can make substantial revenue and subsequent profits on those investments Underestimating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as it invests could lead to a serious mistake on the part of investors on the short side or simply a missed opportunity for those on the sidelines For some reason when a company announces their capital expenditures will be increasing about to in order to invest into new products and further already closed acquisitions it means that this will be the way company spending and subsequently growth will look like from now on Growth will immediately come to an end and all who are holding the stock are doomed At least thats the train of thought Im hearing from the bear side of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB investment theory If you forsake all future looking perspectives in companies then the only way to look must be rearward I would think then one with a clear rear view mirror perspective can understand the results of past investments into a companys business and can say with confidence what current investments should yield If one can see the lack of successful investments then they surely have a case for why current investments should fail and why growth is now doomed to slow to single digit numbers I believe if youre going to call the end of Facebooks growth its diligent to review what theyve done in the past with other investments and how theyve turned out Therefore if you cant believe in the future then the past must be your window and if the past is your window it should tell you about what you should at least expect for the future Otherwise its just an attempt at reviving a bearish thesis but with no factual basis When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>IPOd in May of it was a desktop only revenue company and thus revenue primarily came in through desktop ads This worried investors as they along with the company began to realize that the future was in mobile browsing and app usage Shortly thereafter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock began to sink on worries that there was no road map for an expansion into mobile and mobile revenue In fact it was reported at one time in the Fall of that Twitter NYSE TWTR would overtake <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in mobile advertising Stock sentiment was at an all time low by the time shares sank to a bottom of at the beginning of September of that year Mobile though was something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was looking into It had a mobile site and it had a desktop site The difference was there was no ad product on the mobile side to generate income Their entire income was generated through ads placed on the desktop site along with a small percentage through games and payments The company began working on an ad product that would serve ads in a manner that coincided with smaller screen sizes and blended better into a users overall news feed Estimates were that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would generate M of mobile ad revenue in all of as we can see from the following chart What began to happen by Q of was the first real revenue from mobile For that quarter it was recorded at M or of the overall advertising income <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>actually posted mobile revenue of M for as a whole That was up from the year prior This is also higher than what estimates said in the above chart As we can see the investment in mobile paid off in the very same year the company decided to begin investing Let me continue my rear view mirror looking with the purchase of Instagram the mobile only app during This purchase highlights Facebooks drive to become a mobile company and during thats all Instagram could be used on The purchase was first announced in April of and would at that time hold a B price tag By the time the deal closed it would be worth M because of the sinking share price in H This acquisition seemed outrageous to most critics and investors How could a company with zero profits or income for that matter be worth roughly B <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had plans with Instagram though but it started with gaining users and a larger steadier following Still looking in the rear view mirror we can see that mobile has paid off very well In fiscal we find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>brought in B in mobile ad revenue This compares to the estimates from of M Even if you read the previously referred to chart as operating income instead of revenue and applied the company wide GAAP operating income margin from last year you still wind up with B As you can see from the chart below revenues were up drastically mainly due to mobile ad revenue Of course this is only part of the picture As we know businesses have more than just a revenue aspect they have a bottom line as well During this time net income also increased dramatically as mobile revenue had a high margin much like desktop ad revenue The chart below shows the time frame of June of to December of and the normalized diluted EPS of the company Clearly this wasnt just a top line growth investment but one that made it to the bottom line as well Together it not only grew the companys revenue which would have hit a wall with desktop ads but also made the company profitable Instagram is another investment that seems to have paid off well While still not contributing much to the top line we see that the potential of Instagram is starting to be realized Analysts believe in that Instagram is worth more than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>paid for it in I think thats something I would call a good investment Instagram went from being a mobile only million users app to a B entity with both Android and iOS apps and M users which has surpassed Twitter Jumping to this months news quickly we find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now upping the revenue energy on Instagram This should only now be an earnings call or two away from understanding the full earnings potential of Instagram It seems when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>puts its mind to something it produces quite the return on investment Mobile has proven to be the biggest cash cow year after year that the company has ever had Something that was producing zero dollars in one year is now of their overall yearly revenue as of Q of Their acquisition of a small mobile only app has turned into a bigger than Twitter revenue ready machine The Future Based On The Rear View Perspective Now we get to the heart of the matter If investors expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to produce more revenue and subsequently more profits then it only makes sense to let the company invest in itself If one begrudges the company for investing then I point you to the above facts about what the company has done when it says Lets invest With new assets acquisitions that have been in the user growth stage and are seeing continued product improvements its time to invest in them to turn them into revenue producing cash cows This investing will take time and of course money and should be considered a standard and proven route of accomplishing this goal When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced last year on the Q conference call that it was going to begin spending more on capital expenditures and that cash flow and profit would take a hit the stock reacted in a manner that put downward pressure on it Acquisitions such as Whatsapp and Oculus had not proven anything substantial to that point other than a continued drive toward billion users on the former and a few product developments from the latter The key point to take away here is this isnt the first time weve seen this pattern First an announcement that mobile isnt some place <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is at the stock price falls in lockstep they invest in that area and it turns out to be the most profitable division of the company only a year later and the stock price rises along with revenue and profits again in lockstep It seems the company is able to choose something to invest in and do it right With Facebooks ability to turn something they havent done into a lot of cash it has proven investors wrong This was evident when the company began investing in mobile ads and have since ridden that success to exponential growth This is also evident by how their acquisitions have grown by hundreds of millions of users since their taking over When the company says its going to invest its not time to think this is the end of growth its time to think about how much will it stand to profit and reengergize its growth Judging by the past performance it looks really good If you dont believe in the company going forward then you only have the past to look to The past it turns out doesnt support the notion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will stop growing In fact it proves that when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>invests it creates revenue and profits that are beyond even the wildest dreams of analysts and of course any estimate figures published So I ask then why would you under estimate <span style='background-color:
