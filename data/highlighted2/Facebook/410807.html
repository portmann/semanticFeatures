VFINX VNQ XBI XOM Facebooks stock price has rocketed since its IPO Shares are expensive on traditional valuation metrics Compared to their megacapitalization technology peers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is relatively overvalued Institutional shareholders have been actively reducing the size of their portfolios and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will face selling pressure Many individual stocks and sectors have already experienced their own bear markets yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>remains a beacon of strength It will not pass the scrutiny of a skeptical market To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are avidly buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest ultimate rewards While researching and writing about Apples NASDAQ AAPL relative and absolute undervaluation the striking contrast to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB caught my eye once again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been a darling of growth investors in a growthstarved world owned by an army of institutional and retail investors yet by almost any metric its common shares are overpriced For that reason even the most bullish investors who need to own technology would probably do better with one of Facebooks megacapitalization technology growth peers as its high valuation starting point is simply too big of a hurdle to overcome <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are overvalued relative to its growth prospects relative to the market and relative to its megacapitalization technology peers Since its May IPO almost four years ago exactly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares have dramatically outperformed the SP Index as measured by the SPDR SP Index ETF NYSEARCA SPY gaining versus the gain in the SPY During this timeframe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been an elite momentum stock rarely trading below its day moving average making its shares a favorite of institutional retail and trendfollowing investors Relative to its megacapitalization large growth peers including Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Apple and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has outperformed trailing only Amazon in performance since its inception and this is by a slim margin For reference the SPY has risen over this timeframe Building on this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has outperformed over the past year compared to its peer group with only Amazon topping the social networking giant in share performance For reference SPY has lost over the past year Finally on a yeartodate basis when many leading growth stocks have struggled in FB shares have shined the brightest among its peer group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was the largest technology IPO in history and its arguably expensive stock at the time of the IPO has more than tripled in roughly four years Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>commands one of the largest stock market capitalizations on the planet making its common stock a prime candidate to be examined for signs of overvaluation With shares trading at a trailingtwelve months pricetoearnings PE ratio of versus the SP s the traditional PE ratio is almost four times the broader markets Earnings growth has been robust so the bullish case has been that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could grow its earnings fast enough to eventually grow into its current valuation After all analyst estimates have been rising as the following table shows With estimates up to per share FB trades at a forward PE of using yesterdays May closing price of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares With s earnings anticipated at the PE for is not unreasonable for a company that is projected to grow earnings by from to Thus even to someone who brings a cynical eye to Facebooks earnings and valuation one could make the argument that shares will grow into their present day valuation via superior earnings per share growth as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to monetize its unprecedented base of users The other valuation metrics however leave more to be desired Facebooks pricetobook value PB is versus for the SP Index its pricetosales ratio is versus the for the SP Index and its pricetocash flow PCF ratio is a lofty versus the SP Indexs Perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will simply grow into these valuations through their tremendous ability to generate profits but outsized profitability attracts competition and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>faces a formidable group of competitors who are much more reasonably valued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Overvalued Compared To Peers For the TTM FBs PE ratio is GOOGLs is FBs PB ratio is GOOGLs is FBs PS ratio is GOOGLs PS ratio is and finally FBs PCF ratio is and GOOGLs is On every valuation metric GOOGL is cheaper This is striking to me considering that in my opinion following the developmental path of Alphabet is really a best case scenario for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Alphabet is perhaps the only company in the world that counts more active users that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and its successful foray via a combination of internal development and acquisition into supplemental revenues sources like Android and YouTube is something that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has tried to emulate with their acquisitions of Instagram and Oculus VR Alphabet has a current market capitalization of billion flipflopping with Apple for the largest market capitalization and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a market capitalization of billion From my perspective I cannot imagine how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would ever overtake Alphabet and given the comparatively cheaper shares I would rather own GOOGL today With the Alphabet comparison out of the way lets compare Facebooks valuation to another overvalued growth stock in my opinion and that is Amazon Amazons valuations from Morningstarcom are below For the TTM FBs PE ratio is AMZNs is FBs PB ratio is AMZNs is FBs PS ratio is AMZNs PS ratio is and finally FBs PCF ratio is and AMZNs is The takeaway here is that Amazon at a similar market capitalization of billion compared to Facebooks billion might be Facebooks twin in terms of being overvalued relative to their peers and the market in general Look for a future Amazon article from me on this topic Just for our intellectual curiosity lets look at Facebooks valuations versus Microsoft valuations which are provided by Morningstarcom in the table below For the TTM FBs PE ratio is MSFTs is FBs PB ratio is MSFTs is FBs PS ratio is MSFTs PS ratio is and finally FBs PCF ratio is and MSFTs is Clearly Microsoft at a market capitalization of billion is much cheaper that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>though it is somewhat expensive relative to the market Finally lets revisit my analysis of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>versus Apple valuation comparison that I highlighted in my recent bullish article on Apple shares For the TTM FBs PE ratio is AAPLs is FBs PB ratio is AAPLs is FBs PS ratio is AAPLs PS ratio is and finally FBs PCF ratio is and AAPLs is Compared to Apple which once again has the worlds largest market capitalization at billion the contrast in valuations is striking Apple shares are cheap relative to the market and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are expensive Apple is much cheaper than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and if you were a large capitalization institutional investor I think it would be a nobrainer if you were forced to overweight one of these two stocks The only thing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has in its favor is price momentum As illustrated earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares have resolutely stayed above their day moving average never correcting materially even as stocks like Apple and Amazon have fallen more than from their highs over the past year With the broader largecap largecap growth and technology markets under pressure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is bound to face selling pressure as large institutional shareholders face their own redemption pressures I wrote about this in February of and are forced to trim their largest positions Sands Capital is a growth investor that I am familiar with from my research analyst days prior to when I founded my firm in February of They manage roughly billion in assets under management and their top holdings are listed in the following table Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is their second largest holding as of March With shares in their top holdings outside of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>including Visa NYSE V Salesforcecom NYSE CRM Alibaba Group NYSE BABA Amazon Alphabet Baidu NASDAQ BIDU Regeneron Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ REGN Priceline NASDAQ PCLN Monsanto NYSE MON and Adobe NASDAQ ADBE all experiencing selling pressure in the first half of even though many of these companies have rebounded investors will look to trim positions in their underperforming mutual funds In fact with BIDU shares down roughly yeartodate GOOGL shares down and REGN shares down YTD some of Sands Capitals mutual funds have struggled like Touchstone Sands Capital Institutional Growth Fund MUTF CISGX which is down YTD and with the SP Index roughly flat this will prompt increased redemptions from investors Facebooks largest institutional shareholders are the giants of the investment industry including Fidelity Vanguard State Street NYSE STT T Rowe Price NASDAQ TROW and BlackRock NYSE BLK With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares being the sixthlargest holding in the Vanguard SP Index Fund MUTF VFINX behind Apple Microsoft Exxon Mobil NYSE XOM Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ General Electric NYSE GE and just ahead of Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB there could be a lot of forced selling pressure if the largecap stocks and the broader market turn south Many investors may not know this but largecap US stocks have significantly outperformed their smallcap US peers over the past five years which is unusual behavior for a bull market so there could be some mean reversion in order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had grown dramatically from to becoming the most popular social network in a majority of the world The following Google Trends maps from Vincenzo Cosenza which graphically depict the change in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users from June of through January of beautifully illustrate this growth in Facebooks dominance Twitter NYSE TWTR is the leading social network in Japan but outside of a closed China Russia and a few Russian territories <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>dominates the worlds social networking scene Astute readers will notice the map of the British Empire at the beginning of this article and all empires peak and then fade With billion users and dominance in nearly every country on earth where will future growth come from for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Morningstar an independent research firm has a fair value target for FB shares with the acknowledgement from Morningstar that modeling Facebooks future is highly uncertain They arrived at this target by anticipating that FBs business will reach maturity within the next decade and that FB will post similar profitability and margins comparable to Alphabet with considerably lower revenue Argus and SP Capital IQ two additional independent research firms have price targets of and on FB shares as they are more optimistic about ultimate market share gains and profitability for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Most sellside Wall Street analysts are bullish on FB shares so a clear risk to the short thesis is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares continue to demand a premium valuation while the company routinely exceeds its estimates denying those who are short the stock a chance at even a pullback in price However with optimism among independent and sellside analysts so universally rosy a small change in sentiment could trigger a pullback Even a simple drawdown in shares would bring FBs share price down to roughly and a pullback would take shares down to the high dollar range A growth slowdown or profit miss could do even more damage to FB shares with expectations so high after a period of uninterrupted success A revision to GOOGLs current valuation level could see FB shares lose to over their present value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares have been a go to growth stock in the second longest bull market in US history and the companys valuation market capitalization and retail and institutional sponsorship all appear to be at or near shortterm peak levels In summary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are overvalued and overowned Investors who own them should consider selling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares or hedging their investment A possible pair trade against Facebooks megacapitalization technology peers should at least be investigated Aggressive investors should consider shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares outright via put options or using FB as a short hedge for their long portfolio If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares ever normalized relative to even Alphabets valuation their would be considerable downside potential give FBs nosebleed valuations levels today Over the years a weekend tradition for me is opening up the pages of Investors Business Daily to peruse the IBD Top Even though I am a value investor at heart I respect the accomplishments and seek to learn from William ONeal a legendary and pioneering growth investor who founded Investors Business Daily The IBD list and its predecessors seeks to identify the strongest stocks in the market using fundamental quantitative and technical research <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been the top stock in the IBD for a number of weeks in and it along with a handful of other stocks including Amazon Alphabet Disney NYSE DIS Gilead Sciences NASDAQ GILD and biotech stocks in general NASDAQ IBB NYSEARCA XBI Home Depot NYSE HD Netflix NASDAQ NFLX REITs NYSEARCA IYR NYSEARCA VNQ and Tesla NASDAQ TSLA have been the go to growth investments in the bull market that rose like a phoenix from the ashes in March of The investing thesis behind these bull market heroes has been challenged over the course of the last year The skepticism and scrutiny has intensified in as a majority of the leading stocks have experienced significant corrections and even mighty Amazon experienced a heart stopping swoon In a skeptical environment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook
