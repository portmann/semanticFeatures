over the last days the transformation from the industrial economy to the digital economy is now occurring at warp speed Share prices of the digital economy companies Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hitting alltime highs and four major department store chains hitting new week lows during the week ended May has resulted in a new dimension of risk being added to the worlds equities markets The carnage that I witnessed for all of the department store companies last week ranks as one of the most memorable throughout my year career in the capital markets What is now happening gives new meaning to the catchphrase the rich get richer and the poor get poorer See Oldschool American Retail is getting Crushed by Capitalism May On Thursday May share prices of two of the companies leading the charge for the digital economy Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB hit alltime highs Ubers shares do not trade because it is not yet a public company Conversely share prices of Hertz and six brickandmortar retailers that reported earnings for the week ended May that have business models being disrupted by Amazon and Uber all declined by at least The financial results released by all seven were well below the estimates of Wall Streets analysts Amazon negatively impacted results for Gap Inc NYSE GPS and five department stores and likewise Uber impacted Hertz NYSE HTZ Please see Bloombergs April article entitled Uber Overtakes Rental Cars Among Business Travelers What underscored the reporting of dismal financial results by the six retailers was that the US Commerce Department reported on Friday May that retail sales in the US had increased by for the month of April During May Gap and four of the five department stores reported yearoveryear sales declines The lone holdout Nordstrom NYSE JWN reported an anemic increase Upon its annual results last month Amazon shares soared to new alltime highs which were eclipsed this week See April Amazoncom Announces First Quarter Sales up to Billion press release The dichotomy between the financial results and share price action of Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and the seven household name brickandmortar companies should not be discounted What happened since the beginning of is stunning The week ending Friday April would make the perfect pilot for Nightmare on Wall Street a new series starring the Digital Economy as the villain and the Industrial Economy as the victim Evolution of the transformation of the economy from industrial to digital that began in is not dissimilar to what happened after the transformation from the agricultural to the industrial economy that began in The manufacturers of horsedrawn carriages went out of business while funders and developers of goods and services needed by the newly burgeoning industrial economy built dynastic wealth from to The video below entitled Decade ending best ever for creating dynasty wealth provides details on the economic agriculturalindustrialdigital transformation that has been underway since Over the years that I have been in the capital markets I have found that it is difficult for even savvy investors to grasp that there is not an infinite amount of capital available that can be invested into stocks As of August the total value or market cap of all US stocks was trillion Because the amount that is invested into stocks is finite there is a yin and yang effect Capital moving into Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google driving their shares to new highs is offset by the liquidations of shares of other nondigital companies When an increasing amount of capital is allocated to digital economy companies the result is a decrease in the amount of capital that is invested into industrial companies Therefore the higher the share prices of the digital economy companies go the lower the share prices of the industrial companies must go The same principle applies to the price to earnings ratios That share prices of the worlds leading digital economy companies Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Priceline NASDAQ PCLN Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG LinkedIn NYSE LNKD and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX traded at alltime highs since November of is very bad news for the global stock markets The news is not likely to get any better for the global industrial economy I predict that all six dominant digital economy pure plays will go to new alltime highs over the next weeks My prediction assumes that the markets do not crash The six are and will continue to grow at double digits through at least All have cash flow models that are superior to of all businesses on the planet Declaring that capital flowing out of shares of all of the worlds brickandmortar companies into six companies having an existing aggregate market cap in excess of one trillion dollars on its way to trillion will increase volatility would be an understatement There are many analysts who are predicting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Alphabet and Amazon will eventually get to trillion valuations One analyst is predicting that Amazon could fetch a trillion valuation by What is now happening is especially bad for those large companies that have brickandmortar business and revenue models that are vulnerable to Amazon and the privately held unicorn disruptors including Uber and Airbnb etc Digital disruptors are the industrial economys biggest nemesis They severely disrupt industries some of which have been in existence for a millennium or longer The taxi and limousine and hotel industries are prime examples of industries that are being severely disrupted by digital attackers Unquestionably the most famous digital disruptors are Uber and Airbnb However the king of all of the disruptors is not Uber it is Amazon which was also the very first digital disruptor Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos to digitally disrupt the centuries old bookstore industry From books Amazon went into electronics fashion and media etc Amazon announced that it was adding grocery items including coffee tea and diapers to its private label offerings which would be available as early as the end of May See CNBC Amazon is launching new private labels including food and diapersWSJ May MarketWatch published the following article entitled Amazon is about to overtake Macys as biggest seller of clothing in US on May The Web brands of Amazon Yahoo and eBay became iconic during the late s However of the three only Amazon had a digital disruptor business model Both eBay and Yahoo were first mover companies First mover companies are also members of the growing digital economy Please see the video below entitled Why companies qualifying as a First Mover have the potential to get to billion valuations almost instantly Digital disruptors are lethal Upon their models being honed they automatically begin to virally spread online to wreak havoc for the brickandmortar industry they are disrupting The cash flow models of digital disruptors rank among the very best on the planet They require very little if any advertising expenditures I cannot recall ever having seen an advertisement by Amazon Uber or Airbnb The video below entitled Digital disruptor companies have the potential to get billion valuations quickly explains what Uber did and what other startup digital disruptors must do to become successful The speed at which the digital economy has picked up has been transformational It has increased the probability that the high for the SP will prove to be the high for the current bull market that began in March of In my August article entitled Major US Indices to AllTime Highs in I provided the logic for my recommending the six digital economy companies The six went on to new alltime highs by the end of In my December interview with Opportunist Magazine I further elaborated on the phenomenon of the share prices of digitaleconomy companies going up while shares of brickandmortar companies would be declining The revenue and profits for the digital economy leaders will continue to grow at a doubledigit pace for at least the balance of the current decade and at the expense of the brickandmortar economy The digital economy will continue to grow regardless of any calamity that might hit the world economy Since March I have been predicting that the indices of the worlds developed countries have already entered into a bear market Negative interest rates had begun to spread virally in February after the Bank of Japan instituted a negative interest rate policy Prior to the onset of the negative rates I had been predicting that the bull market would last until at least I had believed that it would take until before the digital economy would be negatively impacting the industrial economys brickandmortar companies The two biggest risks that the worlds economies and markets now face have surfaced since the beginning of They are negative interest rates and a digital economy that is exerting its dominance over the global industrial economy and its brickandmortar companies Given this swiftly developing situation there are only a handful of worthy largecap companies in the world to invest in They include the worlds six foremost largecap digital economy companies that I had originally recommended in my August article They are now all back at the top my radar screen Please see Japans NIRP Increases Probability of Global Market Crash March My recommending any largecap or any equityrelated investment opportunities other than microcap companies or venture capital is contingent upon an investor or their advisor being prepared to monitor the NIRP Crash Indicator NYSE NCI that I developed in February Please see Acclaimed Analyst Produces NIRP Crash Indicator also see MicroCap Shares Can Easily Multiply During A Market Decline Or Recession The indicator enables an investor to have what would be equivalent to a portfolio insurance policy Disaster can be avoided by following a strategy of purchasing put options on their holdings or a futures contract on the SP when the NCI reading goes to ORANGE crash imminent from YELLOW caution Such a strategy is only possible because the NCIs readings have been reliable and potent Please see NIRP Crash Indicator Ideal for Futures Hedging and Trading May The six largecap digital economy companies that are now on my radar screen are Priceline LinkedIn Netflix Alphabet Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Disney is back on to my screen because it has the content that the six need to compete with each other Shares of the shippers UPS NYSE UPS and FedEx NYSE FDX are also keepers To compete or just survive all department stores and retail stores selling anything shippable will have no choice but to transition to conducting a higher portion of their sales online As of the date of this report the six of the nine companies on my radar screen in the table below have been officially recommended I will add Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Fedex upon their share prices correcting Shares of companies in this report that are being negatively impacted by Uber and Amazon should be sold on strength and should be avoided as longterm investments I also recommend that the shares of WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT and Sears Holdings NASDAQ SHLD be avoided The shares of any and all brickandmortar retailers which market and sell utilitarian products including diapers bathroom tissue detergents lessperishable food items including candies coffee nuts tea etc that can be easily shipped should be avoided The shares of Proctor Gamble NYSE PG should be sold in perpetuity It is the one behemoth company that is the most vulnerable to Amazons disruptive tactics From reading Amazons recent product private labeling announcement it is very clear that the attack that the King of Disruption is mounting will take market share from Proctor Gamble Proctor Gamble which generate billion of revenue in fiscal is completely defenseless against Amazon Proctor and its brands which include Pampers and Tide will not be able to compete against Amazons lower prices and sameday delivery system because all of the companys products are marked up and sold from grocery store shelves Finally the shares of Avis Budget Group NASDAQ CAR should be avoided Another huge and inherent disadvantage that retailers and rental car companies have when compared to the digital disruptors is traffic congestion Shopping and purchasing habits of consumers have been permanently altered by worldwide traffic problems the result of governments not adding adequate infrastructure The preference is for purchases to be shipped to ones doorstep and to ride in the carpool lanes Traffic congestion is accelerating the transformation from the industrial to the digital economy Since Alphabet Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and LinkedIn all have utilitarian or recurringvisitor models they are all well positioned to participate in online equity crowdfunding With the Monday May lifting by the SEC of the final crowdfunding ban in place since the digital disruption and dismantling of the brickandmortar global investment banking and venture capital industries will begin I am currently working on a report that will include my recommendations for those companies positioned to benefit The report will provide details regarding how online equity crowdfunding has the potential to become one of the largest sources of revenue for the digital economy and five of its leading companies The rapidly morphing digital economy especially the emergence of online equity crowdfunding was the impetus for founding the exclusive Dynasty Wealth NYSE DW Investing community DWs specialty is to identify and produce ongoing research on companies that have the potential to multiply by to times in value within five years Without the transformation from the industrial to the digital economy which began when Netscape unveiled its Navigator browser in it would have been impossible to establish such a community Digital economy companies including disruptors and first movers certainly manifest such potential For example a investment into Ubers private placement was valued for million in equivalent to a multiple of more than within years My years of experience in the markets and the extensive research that I have conducted on the digital economy has enabled me to identify several outstanding disruptors and first movers What distinguishes these is their potential to disrupt industries as large as or even larger than the industries that Uber and Airbnb are disrupting One recent digitaldisruptor discovery is disrupting the billion grocery industry and its vendor supply chain The company provides nonGMO and organic foods directly to a consumers doorstep at prices that are below conventional foods It also has patented a process that enables it to grow and deliver fresher and higher quality organic produce and at lower prices than now available in Whole Foods NYSE WFC and other grocery stores The most fascinating disruptor that I am now following is one that has developed software and systems that are very disruptive to the social media industry and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It quickly grew to over one million registrants after launching its beta version Based on some new developments and the June launch of the next version of its software the companys monthly unique visitor count will grow by an annualized by the end of the summer The number of monthly unique visitors will grow from a most recent to For an overview and access to links to the subjects that I cover including the
