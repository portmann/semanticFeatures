class='textDiv'>Not Too Late To Board The Netflix Bull Train Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Bandwidth concern is being addressed If you followed the recommendation of my article from early September titled Buy the Netflix Dip then cheers to you The stock has generated substantial alpha since then bumping the article up in status to be a premium article In that article I addressed the fact that competition from other content streaming providers was being given too much credit and predicted that Netflixs expansion into different countries will be better than expected The stronger than forecasted numbers from Australia and New Zealand where Netflix launched on March th proved this analysis to be correct and was a great positive catalyst for the stock last month There are still many bears that believe Netflix will not be as successful in other markets so every time they get proved wrong the stock will climb Netflix just entered the Italian Portuguese and Spanish markets in October and will launch in Hong Kong Singapore South Korea and Taiwan in early News about subscriber growth in these areas will continue to serve as a great short term catalysts The ultimate question and concern that came up in my previous article was the valuation of Netflix How can you value this growth stock that has a current PE ratio of at share Is it really a company that should have a billion market cap How long will it take them to grow into that valuation I will look at this closer after evaluating another concern that deserves more attention Netflixs bandwidth problem Many are fearful that the amount of internet traffic Netflix is creating is too high and that the ISPs Internet Service Providers will look to increase the price of Netflixs Internet usage due to its high bandwidth requirements for streaming According to Sandvine a broadband networking company that releases data on Internet usage Netflix now accounts for of downstream traffic on fixed networks up from in the second half of In addition the studyfound that HBO is also experiencing growth mostly due to the launch of its new streaming service HBO NOW and itsGame of Thrones program which has been such a huge hit it is worthy of mention and certainly responsible for much of this growth Side note the increased success of these two companies proves a point that I displayed in my previous article the market size and the number of subscribing streamers is increasing so it is ok if more competition enters this market because it has not taken away market share from Netflix The likely explanation for this is that people are more likely to subscribe to other services in addition to Netflix rather than cancel their Netflix subscription and then subscribe to something else like Amazon Prime Additionally this percentage will increase even more as K continues to become more popular and LTE and fiber Internet continue to improve Netflix does not own any of the internet bandwidth They have deals for the shortterm with the ISPs but its hard to imagine a scenario where Netflix can continue to ride on this platform with increasing bandwidth usage without having their costs increase Netflix acknowledges this risk and has already taken steps to innovate its way out of this problem According to Variety Netflix is reencoding all of its content with more granulated bitrates In order to understand what this means you just need to know that all shows are different in the bitrate they require A cartoon with a limited amount of colors and camera movements doesnt demand the same bitrate as an action movie like World War Z They are hoping that this will produce about in bandwidth savings In addition to the decreased cost of bandwidth ISP networks wont get as much traffic thus customers like you and I will use less data allowing us to save on data costsusage These algorithms that were created will scan every episode and movie in the Netflix library to determine how complex it is and what type of bitrate it requires This encoding technology is especially great news for those overseas that have slower bandwidth speeds Take a look at the chart below which examines internet speeds in Mbps Megabits per second produced by Tech First Post Report citing the Akamai Q State of Internet Report This new encoding technology that allows for Netflix to deliver highquality videos with lower bandwidth usage will help launch a successful expansion into places like India in the future and southeast Asia in early Netflix is a growth stock and is not valued based on profitability and ability to generate free cash flow in the short term However it seems to be valued based on its potential future earnings and its subscription growth which will continue to remain at a healthy growth rate for a long time Netflix is profitable in the US and expects to be close to breaking even in international markets in This will be a big positive catalyst that can be expected sometime in the last half of Most important and what will drive Netflixs growth in subscribers is its incredibly positive reputation with consumers This affects their ability to retain as well as attract new customers This positive reputation is mostly due to Netflixs original content which has an incredible amount of diehard fans Netflix set a record this year as the first online streaming service provider to garner the most Golden Globe nominations at eight This is also the first time since the year that HBO isnt leading the nominations in the television categories Our world is only going to become increasingly personalized and internetized especially in Europe Asia and Latin America where most of Netflixs long term growth is going to come from All FANG stocks are going to benefit from this long term trend especially Netflix since it is still barely penetrating most international markets Of its about million subscribers about million are in the United States Netflixs seemingly lofty valuation of billion in market cap doesnt seem so lofty when you consider all of the potential it has due to having so many loyal customers I believe the majority of subscribers would tolerate Netflix increasing prices month domestically for its streaming subscription providing a huge boost to their bottom line Netflix raised the price of this service month back in October to and the market reacted very positively shares of Netflix closed up on the day of the announcement There are many other long term growth options to consider when trying to value Netflix which is why its such a hard stock to value and why there has been a lot of short term volatility with its share price Think about what would happen to the stock price if they began streaming live sports Or if they began placing ads on the side of their library to start bringing in ad revenue like websites such as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have Netflix is still far from being a mature company and the market for subscribers will continue to increase at a very healthy rate Here is a simple chart looking at domestic and international subscribers in millions Here I am assuming a slower domestic growth rate in which will sustain in and then the market will become saturated domestically and subscriber growth will drop to million per year in and For forecasting international growth I modestly put in a million per year subscriber growth rate for the next five years which would still nearly double the amount of subscribers that Netflix has now With million subscribers and about billion in revenue this year that means that Netflix is trading at times its revenue Assuming in the year that Netflix is charging per subscribing member of its streaming service which is conservative in my opinion and have no other sources of revenue they will bring in about billion in revenue Which means that if their market cap was still billion they would only be trading at times their revenue which is more than reasonable given the growth opportunities It is also helpful to imagine what type of premium a buyer would have to pay for Netflix when trying to determine a proper valuation since that ultimately is what a company is worth what someone is willing to pay for it For a mediocre comparison Snapchat was valued at billion in its last funding series in May and what do you think there revenue is going to be in Enough said In summary there are a plethora of growth options and positive upsides in the future that make it hard to value this growth stock However you have to be shortsighted to not see Netflix justify an even higher market cap in the upcoming years If you havent already its still not too late to jump onboard the Netflix bull train We only use your contact details to reply to your
