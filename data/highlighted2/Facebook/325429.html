style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has seen a significant pull back since it reported Q earnings despite an initial pop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>selling off is unwarranted and still trades at an attractive price despite its large valuation Ill present several strategies to protect your investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the market continues to be more volatile than normal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB in my opinion is one of the best longterm growth stocks on the current market and I am incredibly bullish about its prospects You can read my previous takes on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on Seeking Alpha Im Doubling Down On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>September However after watching the company experience a rapid increase and then pull back after the recent earnings report I was curious as to why so much selling was occurring Given my bullishness on the company the strategies discussed below revolve around trying to retain a long position in FB while protecting against downside risk that may occur given the markets instability On a daytoday basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is generally low beta However depending on the time period you choose to look at the beta for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>changes in an interesting manner While Ive observed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>generally holds a tighter correlation to the SP NYSEARCA SPY than the Nasdaq NASDAQ QQQ over a sixmonth time frame youll notice that the correlation is slightly stronger to the Nasdaq just by a few basis points Below is the correlation between FB and the Nasdaq as well as the SP Notice the beta figures for both correlations as allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to have a small premium over just buying into these indexes The recent trend towards strength with the Nasdaq could be due to the recent selloff in tech and cloudbased equities and I believe that gets supported with the sharp difference in beta seen through the YTD looking glass <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is sporting a beta to the SP YTD but only a beta to the Nasdaq YTD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock YTD is only down So what does this mean To have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>provide the muchneeded alpha in a YTD group of equities that have been crushed by double digit losses youre going to need to hedge your investment as uncertainty continues to grip markets While Id recommend selling the mini contracts for both NDX and SPX thats not necessarily the most viable strategy for retail investors and carries a risk level that isnt easily manageable compared to other securities Perhaps the best idea here is to hedge your investment not with futures but inverse index ETFs The benefit of doing this is you dont short anything but take long positions in these inverse ETFs which still allows you to have a payoff matrix of limited downside and unlimited upside In crafting such a position it depends largely how leveraged you want to be relative to your investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Id recommend using either Direxions x Bear SP NYSEARCA SPXS which has a near identical correlation to another inverse ETF the UltraShort SP NYSEARCA SDS or use the ProShares Short SP ETF NYSEARCA SH which is slightly less levered Naturally there are Nasdaq equivalents to these ETFs but based upon the correlations that Ive established with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>against market indexes it is ideal to pursue an inverse ETF related to the SP given that is the index that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is more heavily fluctuating against To visualize this below is Facebooks stock against these three particular ETFs over the past six months Notice how the various uptrends and downtrends directly contradict each other Once you compute how much you want to reduce down by adding a long position in one of these inverse ETFs allows you to run a more riskaverse portfolio Naturally as these are leveraged ETFs youre going to want to have a stop loss in place in case of a large market rally in one session or a multiday sustained rally These inverse ETFs when allocated to properly dont just help you hedge against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but also any other lowbeta equity in your portfolio That dual purpose could be critically helpful over the coming quarters Strategy Go Long Stick To Your Rules is shaping up to be a volatile year if it continues on the trajectory weve already seen YTD Well likely continue to see more marketwide turbulence and unwarranted selling of FB shares as the underlying fundamentals havent changed and if anything have improved If hedging is not your forte or you wish to be passive with your investment then stay long if you already hold a long position The riskreward scenario presented is not anything wildly attractive given that it is relatively flat YTD but the notable rebuttal is that FB is trading nearly off of its week high of With a new revenue stream coming online in Q well largely see speculation drive the stock away from major indexes This reduces the riskreward favorability for future longs but does create a window of opportunity The pullback sub was certainly an attractive window for initiating an entry in retrospect If theres a pullback in the broader market theres likely going to be a pullback in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>given what we now know about the correlations Now its going to be hard to imagine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>trading sub in the nearterm ie months months but its certainly a possibility The best thing to do in this situation is not to panic Furthermore this may be mitigated by the potential strength of future earnings reports as we just saw with the Q ER If you notice the pop FB made past the level and even higher theres an incredible amount of support for the stock If you went long in FB in Q its likely your cost basis is in the low s which means you are either flat or have only lost a small amount Additionally if you want to retain your long position in FB but want more current income in the shortterm Im a strong advocate of allocating stagnant capital to current income stocks such as utilities like Duke Energy NYSE DUK Southern NYSE SO or even the SPDR Utilities ETF NYSEARCA XLU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still a massive growth company and wont likely pay a dividend for quite some time Starting to build up your cash assets in an uncertain market is a smart step to reduce equity exposure in a volatile market without altering a long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>These are the steps that should be taken to secure against losses If youre already long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like I am you likely have a longer time frame in mind before you would consider selling Personally I dont plan on selling my stake in FB until Ive reached my newly established tolerance If we reflect on the past performance of FBs equity since its IPO we see that many of the downturns are no longer than a few months with enough volatility to create up days for worried investors to exit their positions with some gains intact However FB entered in the middle of a bull market in May and with present fears revolving around a stronger market correction past performance is likely not indicative of future performance The small shortlived declines you can see in this otherwise exceptional chart may not be reflected in the next potential decline I bought more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>last week because I like what Im seeing for the longterm with this company and the pull back from its earnings report high keeps my cost basis attractive That being said pursuing one of the abovedetailed strategies is likely a smart decision to protect your investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Finally you are more than welcome to pursue strategies with options or other asset classes but Id recommend you do so at your own risk I wrote this
