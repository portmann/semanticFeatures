style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>changed its advertising policy where now advertisers will only be paying for external clicks to their websites Now we will see how engaged Facebooks users really are It looks likely that Facebooks privacy problems in Europe are going to elevated over time This can only slow revenue growth as less info will be gathered over time A lot of technical damage has been done to the SP and the Nasdaq over the past few weeks I cant see both indexes recovering any time soon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB almost reached a share this year but has since slipped back to sub levels Marc Zuckerburg announced very recently that billion people used the companys platform in one single day This number was a significant milestone but you have to wonder where will Facebooks growth come from going forward Furthermore most of the users presently on the platform are in the Americas and Europe with the US accounting for almost half of Facebooks revenue I have no doubt that the pending airborne drones initiative and the current rollout of Internetorg will increase users But what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>really goes by is advertising revenue per user With billion people currently on the planet the company can still be scaled aggressively but profit margins will need to increase once more operating margins are declining on average yearoveryear and engagement will need to be better Currently the average engagement time on the platform is under minutes which is not enough going forward The company is presently pushing video uploads a lot which will definitely improve engagement times among its users but it still has a lot to do in terms of variety before the company will be able to coax YouTube users over to its platform Yes the company has many things going for it but I just feel the drawbacks over power the positives Lets discuss in detail Were updating CPC to only account for what we call link clicks ie the clicks related to certain ad objectives such as clicks to visit another website Once this change goes into effect advertisers who care about link clicks are likely to see better return on advertising spend since theyll be paying for only the most valuable outcome Separating link clicks from engagement clicks including likes and comments means your budget will be spent more efficiently no matter if you bid for clicks or engagement So the bottom line is that advertisers will now only pay for external clicks clicks that go to their websites and will not be charged for internal clicks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in terms of an advertising platform is still in its infancy Metrics up to now were not able to be evaluated accurately but now they will be Just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can calculate to the cent how much a user is worth advertisers now with the updated system will be able to calculate the average cost of a lead However having a lead is one thing making a sale is another so we have to go deeper I studied marketing a few years ago where I saw that leads from social network platforms were not as valuable as leads from a search engine or article It makes sense that lead to sale metrics or ROI metrics are in this order in terms of ROI efficiency The add which coverts over time a lead to sale the most is a newsletter add or an add embedded into an engaged article The problem with advertising on social media is that users normally are not in buying mode On the contrary when reading an article or newsletter about a product the user is actively engaged in the buying process Over time marketers and advertisers will see that social media leads or traffic are not as potent as other leads from other media It stands to reason People go on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to interact not to look for information on products Furthermore the more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>puts advertising in front of its users the more it runs the risk of having a mass exodus of users long term Secondly Its apparent that Facebooks problems in Europe are not going to go away any time soon Many countries such as France Spain and Germany have pending cases with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>that have yet to be resolved but the most recent highlighted case is Belgium Belgian data protective authorities want to file suit as they have seen that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still tracking users even when The user is not logged into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has more or less confirmed that it uses cookies to target advertising when the user is off its platform But the tech company is still stating that it only needs to go through its Irish hub regarding any regulation or privacy queries I have seen this in other industries also and it is really riling a lot of people Ever since Europe was opened up many sectors international financial planning is another have flourished because only one licence or hub is needed in one EU country in order to operate legally in all countries This will indeed change which will probably slow growth in the EU as independent countries will have more power over tech companies operating in their space Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still waiting on Europes decisions with regard to the NSAPRISM dragnet surveillance program This ruling will be announced this month The more info that comes out about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>either breaching privacy policy or sharing private information the worse it will be for this tech giant Moreover with the stock trading at almost times earnings future user numbers seem to be priced in The speed at which the company wants to grow may be a derailing factor here especially in Europe A lot of technical damage has been done here First the day moving average has been penetrated and both the and daily moving averages have crossed over The Nasdaq INDEXNASDAQIXIC also has been hit hard The tech sector has had a huge run up over the last few years with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>being no different since its IPO Furthermore the company doesnt pay a dividend so I see little downside protection here at present Disclosure Iwe have
