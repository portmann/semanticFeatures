in some ways facebook is kind of like the old soapbox in hyde park im sure theyre data gathering but it is what it is from experience facebook definitely can be a dangerous time sink but its also a platform of sorts for listening topromotingdistributing music although maybe those bastards at facebook itself think they own everything that gets posted ive never read the user agreement but people say that facebook claims ownership of everything posted ymmv meeting up with old friends and sometimes making new ones may or may not be such a bad thing facebook can put you in touch with the most
