style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is facing the responsibilities of a publisher and failing Unwilling to displease anyone its moves wind up pleasing no one Like Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL which it has replaced for many mobile users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has achieved enormous power to mold minds Google responded to this mainly by ignoring it Sites like Google News and Google Finance which offer searches on news and finance respond algorithmically to what users want without human intervention Theyre also not monetized This way Google cant be accused of favoring one view or another or favoring one advertiser It doesnt like to see itself as a publisher Publishers are human Google is a computerized curator Facebooks news feed cant work that way It curates items of interest based on user behavior and acts as a primary interface to the whole <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>system Whom you friend or what you respond to will only partly determine the subjects that go into your news feed Others are added by human editors for the benefit of the whole group Like Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not want to be perceived as a publisher Being a publisher carries with it certain responsibilities to the audience Those are things <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would rather have its users create for themselves through its software But it doesnt because that software so intimately involved with the audience is going to carry prejudices with it All this first came to a head two months ago when conservative groups echoing the charge of a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>editor accused the site of censoring conservative views in its trending topics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>denied it but politicians saw a way to bash the company and started playing the feud Trying to backpedal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>tried to get out of way removing summaries from its trending topics But thats not the way politics works Once youre in with politicians youre in until the politicians tire of the game Conservative politicians have not tired of the game Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trying something else working to get rid of clickbait articles that are created using Search Engine Optimization techniques specifically to draw audiences Despite good intentions this will also fail It will fail because clickbait techniques are as common on political sites as anywhere else Getting rid of clickbait then will be seen as evidence of bias The problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is more basic than the controversy and strikes at the heart of its business model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like Google lets advertisers pay runofnetwork prices for discrete audiences Creating discrete audiences and getting a premium for letting advertisers access has been the entire journalism business model for over a century Having destroyed that model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>finds itself with a responsibility it does not want Adding live video only magnifies the problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is replacing other forms of journalism becoming not a publisher but THE publisher for much of its audience and this carries with it moral ethical and even legal responsibilities tech companies have sought to avoid for decades Social networks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter NYSE TWTR and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD are all facing this responsibility None are effectively dealing with it and all are starting to pay a price for that failure The American Consumer Satisfaction Index is finding less satisfaction with Internet Social Media generally and with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>specifically The editorial process of getting clicks is getting in the way of the business model Does this mean you should sell sell sell all your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock No There is far more to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is Instagram its Whatsapp its Oculus and its other things as well as a large growing cloud provider and a prime acquirer of anything else that might come around in terms of Internet content Mostly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is Mark Zuckerbergs gut just as Apple NASDAQ AAPL for years was Steve Jobs gut and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT was Bill Gates gut If Im considering a purchase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock today Im looking at the jockey not the horse That will remain true for years to come Unless that is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can no longer deliver the growth its presently delivering and the fat operating margins that let it bring of that money to the bottom line Its when I see that going away that Im selling but until I do see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will remain the tip of the FANG spear Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL GOOGL MSFT I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Internet Information Providers
