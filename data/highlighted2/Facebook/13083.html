class='textDiv'>The Zendesk Story Is All Coming Together With Its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Partnership Zendesk Inc NYSEZEN Seeking Alpha ZENs announcement today that it is partnering with FB to help facilitate FBs new Businesses on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>initiative is huge for many reasons This positions ZEN as a midterm MA option for FB as well as plenty of other companies I also believe this partnership will lead to massive amounts of operating leverage for ZEN as its able to decrease SM spending in the immediate term I expect ZEN to have a huge months in front of it when it comes to revenue growth and customer acquisition Today will be remembered as a defining moment in the history of ZEN be long this moment and ride the ZEN wave How awesome does Zendesks NYSE ZEN Zopim acquisition look now that it has announced that Zopim chat can facilitate businesses Businesses on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB participation I mean really As if making it convenient for the company to have Asian exposure and for the company to launch its Far East expansion wasnt enough Zopim just secured a partnership with a company that should now be considered a potential buyer longer term Heck it should be considered a buyer in the mid term or however long it takes ZEN to prove its competence in this matter Oh yeah that company is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Thats right ZENs Zopim chat platform through an integration with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger will begin allowing businesses to chat with customers via Messenger You can imagine with FBs Messenger user base of over million people that this makes ZEN an immediate must own and longterm hold By the way thats as of today Thats not including the potential merging of FBs Messenger and its WhatsApp application Thats not including the potential integration of the infancy stage messaging capability of FBs Instagram Did I mention were still talking just about FB If you dont think this is the first shot fired in what will be a perpetual and endless list of followers you dont think that Twitter NYSE TWTR is now going to be forced to find some way to integrate an offering thats similar in which ZEN will be the only proven and scale tested option for facilitation You better believe that matters I believe this news to change the longterm outlook for the company from one of high visibility of success to one of almost guaranteed success FB cannot allow this venture to be nonsuccess in that this venture bringing businesses to consumers via its centralized platform could end up being its biggest revenue segment Yes maybe bigger than advertising when its all said and done Regardless of that I cant remember the last time a FB project failed The investment community thought it was crazy for buying Instagram some thought it marked the top of the social media bubble at the time The investment community thought it was crazy for buying WhatsApp for a multiple of the price it paid for Instagram The investment community recommended rehab for FB when it bought VR company Oculus Is it really that big of a stretch of the imagination to think FB would buy a company with a billion market cap that it selfmade on the back of an excellent service thats already proven to have global scalability Really Expect ZENs revenues to see a material uptick from the already fast rates of growth that we ZEN investors were expecting When you factor in this FB news with the international expansion news the company released just a few weeks ago I think ZEN has an absolute blowout months in front of it Todays PR also goes a long way into explaining ZENs recent cash raise which was perfectly explainable prior as well which it did most likely with the FB news in hand Ill look to get in touch with ZEN IR over the next few days to see if ZEN can release anything around the economics of this partnership but even if they cant this is hugely bullish on all durations Im expecting the above mentioned revenues explosion obviously a customer count explosion sequentially falling SM expenses as a percentage of revenues for the next hopefully or quarters as ZEN should need to do less SM as it can live on the FB network effect forgive the pun and Im expecting ZEN to realize a marked level of operating leverage as a result of all of this Source The Zendesk Story Is All Coming Together With Its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Partnership
