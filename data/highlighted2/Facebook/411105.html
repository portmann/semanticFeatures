portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator Bookmark Post Share on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Share on Twitter Comments sharing is caring facebook lawsuits privacy Way back in late a lawsuit accused <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>of scanning links in users private messages and turning them into public Likes from which the company earned revenue This week a federal court certified the class action giving it the green light to move forward but none of the plaintiffs should expect to see any money if they prevail at trial According to the complaint which was amended in April PDF when someone pasted a URL into a private message with another user <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>treated the content of Plaintiffs private messages as an endorsement of the website adding up to two Likes to the pages count So even if you wrote your buddy Hey check out this awful website <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>might still consider the sharing and any subsequent clicking on that link as an endorsement In a court order PDF granting class certification to the lawsuit more details have come out on why and how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>uses this information from private messages Through the discovery process the plaintiffs point to internal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>emails to support their claims One email refers to the acknowledged problem that a shortage of likes is limiting the number of users that can be targeted by their interests and thereby affecting revenue A second employee email more explicitly states that the motivation behind including privatemessage data in Like counts was to make the counts as big as possible Yet another employee wrote in an email that we have intentionally not proactively messaged what this Like number is since its kind of sketchy how we construct it Even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>CEO Mark Zuckerburg chimed in on the issue in an email complaining that the Like equivalents on Twitter were higher than what youd see on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and that we should be showing the largest number we can rationalize showing In addition to racking up potentially bonus Likes for web pages the plaintiffs claimed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>scrapes the data from these private messages to create profiles of users which are then used to deliver targeted advertising The plaintiffs originally sought to define the offended class as all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users located within the US who have sent or received private messages that included URLs in their content from within two years before the filing of this action up through and including the date when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ceased its practice Then when it came time to file the motion to certify the plaintiff class the description became simultaneously more generous removing a reference to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>having ended the practice and more specific adding the requirement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>must have generated a URL attachment from the link shared in the private message The plaintiffs say that both changes to the class description were based on things they learned during the discovery process Speaking of which they also claim that having access to proprietary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>info has turned up other alleged violations of federal law First they allege that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is using info scraped from private messages not just to generate recommendations for those involved in the message itself but also for thirdparty users According to their review of Facebooks inner workings your friends recommendations are based in part on the links you share So the collection of this data has an impact on more than the two people involved in the private conversation Finally the plaintiffs claim that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is sharing the data collected from private messages with third parties so that they can generate targeted recommendations Facebooks lawyers and the plaintiffs experts have gone back and forth about whether or not its possible to ascertain which users may have been affected by Facebooks datascraping Ultimately the court came down on the side of the plaintiffs finding that the class of plaintiffs was identifiable that it was so large in scale that the plaintiffs need not provide specific numbers and that they all involve the same common legal questions While the plaintiffs allege that Facebooks scraping and sharing of the URLs from private messages constitutes a violation of the antiwiretapping prohibitions in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act the company contends that the ECPA only applies to the interception of the content of messages and that all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing is sharing the record information about the message which they believe would be allowable under the law <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>argues that the only way to determine if it truly scraped the content of these messages would be to perform a URLbyURL messagebymessage senderbysender analysis of the potentially billions of messages sent by the presumably hundreds of millions of plaintiffs in the class Whats more Facebooks position is that the URLs in these private messages do not constitute content However the court disagreed In the messages at issue in this case the sender is affirmatively choosing to share a certain webpage with the recipient and the webpage itself is the substance purport or meaning of the message writes the court The fact that the substance of the message happens to be in the form of a URL does not transform it from content to record information The judge notes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>undermines its own argument by its practice of creating URL preview for the links that are shared in these messages If the URL represented only record information then why would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>create a preview of it for the recipient to view asks the court However because it will effectively be impossible to prove that the members of the class actually suffered any damage as a result of the alleged wrongdoing the court certified the class of plaintiffs in such a way that they will not receive any monetary relief That means that if the plaintiffs prevail <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could be stopped from this sort of practice but dont expect to get any sort of payment out of it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a statement to The Verge seemed pleased with that decision We agree with the courts finding that the alleged conduct did not result in any actual harm and that it would be inappropriate to allow plaintiffs to seek damages on a classwide basis explains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which contends that the remaining claims relate to historical practices that are entirely lawful Court <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Must Face FacialRecognition
