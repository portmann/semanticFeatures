of and net margins by That is why investors overreacted when the potential successor to the CEO left causing Disneys stock price to decline by following his departure We believe this was an overreaction because it neglects the segment leaders and their critical roles to Disneys success We also believe that internal recruitment is still possible Disneys NYSE DIS current management has done an outstanding job In the last decade since the current Disney CEO Robert A Iger took office Disneys stock price has risen by compared to by the SP in the same time frame as shown below Hence the reason why the stock price declined when the anticipated succession plans fell into disarray when Tom Staggs Disneys COO and apparent heir to CEO Robert A Iger unexpectedly stepped down Staggs leadership style was thought to closely resemble that of the current CEO The similar leadership style to Iger is critical because it has enabled Disney to continuously grow its book value per share by making accretive acquisitions Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm acquisitions These accretive acquisitions were complemented by great execution This allowed Disney to grow net margins by an average of in almost a decade The aforementioned similarities between Staggs and Iger with respect to the stock performance in the last years explains why the resignation of Staggs caused Disneys stock price to take a nosedive of Consequently because management has been on the right track investors are fearful of a management shift because it can distort Disneys growth trajectory In addition to the gain Disneys stock has created for its shareholders the company has also grown dividends at an average of yy since as shown below This shareholder mentality coupled with the ability of the billion company to maintain total cash of billion as of the Most Recent Quarter or MRQ TTM ROE and TTM ROA of and respectively and in operating margin makes change a risk endeavor But before we dive into the details of the article we need to outline where our arguments are coming from They originate from ways Disney can create shareholder value moving forward Dividend growth Increase Disneys ability to efficiently increase the amount of FCF over time and grow earnings Accretive Intellectual Property IP portfolio Carry out accretive acquisitions and reduce credit risk by paying off its billion total debt as of the Most Recent Quarter MRQ Price appreciation In addition to the aforementioned ways of increasing shareholder value we are looking for ways and means management can be a catalyst to Disneys stock appreciation With the above points in mind we argue that Disneys current management is well structured to drive growth forward even in the absence of Iger This is because Disney has five segments it will have four segments at the end of FY as Interactive and Consumer Products will be merged which are managed by separate people These leaders are the pillars holding the company in place Consequently punishing the stock because an overseer left neglects the corporate structure and the significance of these pillars to Disneys success Lastly we also argue that internal recruitment is not completely off the table The pillars of Disney have proven themselves to be growth drivers and successful leaders Hence they cannot be neglected in the search for the CEO First Thomas O Staggs was the second in command to the current CEO Robert A Iger but he is not the only potential candidate for internal recruitment With respect to dividend growth it is critical that Disney chooses someone who will focus on earnings growth This means growing the top line through new initiatives as well as being efficient at maximizing the bottom line This is why Disneys Interactive and Consumer Products Segments are critical In the last five years Disneys Interactive and Consumer Products segments have outpaced every other segment by growing operating income at an average of and respectively The and growth rates are way higher than the companys overall fiveyear growth rate of Besides when you extrapolate the growth rates of these various segments Interactive and Consumer Products segments show the most potential for growth moving forward Knowing which segments are the highest growth areas for Disney is very important for dividend investors because the leaders managing the Interactive and the Consumer Products segments would be great candidates for Disneys new CEO The Chairman of Disneys Consumer Products and Interactive Media is James Pitaro He has been at Disney for almost five years According to his LinkedIn profile he joined Disney in October of By FY end Disneys Interactive Media and Consumer Products was making a loss of million and it is now making profits of million The aggregate FY revenues for the two segments are billion which is almost equivalent to Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX total revenues of billion Therefore when you talk about growth and being visionary there are people within Disney who are just as effective at implementation and visionary as Netflixs CEO Reed Hastings Secondly there are two segments that have contributed the most to Disneys total revenues Looking at growth rates alone will neglect Disneys Media Networks and Disneys Park Resorts segments which respectively contribute and to Disneys total revenues as of FY end Ben Sherwood and John Skipper are both coChairs of Disneys Media Networks They both manage a billion in revenues business The two of them are responsible for of Disneys total revenues making them more capable to advance to more senior positions Furthermore Bob Chapek is the chairman of Disney Parks and Resorts and runs a billion in revenues business which is almost equivalent to running <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB which has billion in revenues as of FY end Moreover the other fear is that Staggs was an overseer He was not only running one segment This is true but Christine M McCarthy is also an overseer She is Disneys Chief Financial Officer and should have a good grasp of the companys financials What needs to be improved and areas where cost efficiency will be useful When you look at the need for efficiency in order to grow margins and provide dividend growth you need someone who understands the numbers As a result we believe that Disney is in great hands regardless of who takes over as long as they do not disturb what is working We think that the aforementioned team members are more than capable of running their respective segments and Disney as a whole if given a chance As a result overselling Disneys stock because Staggs left is an overreaction If the new CEO is an outsider as long as he or she does not distort the path that Disney is on and supports the segment leaders we believe that the search for a new CEO should not negatively affect Disneys stock price The misconception here is that the CEO is the only one in charge of all segments and hence Disneys survival relies on who replaces him But this is not true Disney is a huge company with segments run by capable people who have proven themselves over the years The company is in good hands has great management and it is on the right path Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself
