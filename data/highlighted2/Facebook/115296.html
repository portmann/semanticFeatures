style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will enter music video and audio streaming soon Previous research indicates that this move is insignificant for investors However music streaming services are loved by teenagers According to Musically social media powerhouse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB will introduce an online video platform soon including music video content Another article indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also considers introducing its own music streaming service in the future The introduction of Facebooks video platform is already discussed by Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Cho in this article Mr Cho concludes that Facebooks recent move in videos does not add much value to shareholders However I find that Facebooks move in music does add value for shareholders This includes the companys music video platform One of Facebooks biggest challenges is to keep its platform interesting for teenagers This report by Bloomberg shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is losing popularity among teens The portion of teenage users in the age between and years old in the US decreased to in from in and in Further teens do not consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the most important social network any more see graph below The percentage of teens naming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the most important social network dropped to in from in Why is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>losing popularity among teens According to this article there are two reasons for teenagers to drop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>became very popular with teenagers family members including parents Therefore teenagers have become more cautious in using the platform Second teenagers are using other fast growing social media platforms such as Snapchat and Facebookowned Instagram Why are teenagers so important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Facebooks business model is based on selling advertisements Teenagers traditionally are an important group for advertisers because their brand preference is not set yet This article further names teenagers purchasing power and natural familiarity with social media and technology as reasons for advertisers to target teenagers through social media These arguments are confirmed by the findings of this report Researchers asked in which way people prefer companies to communicate with them The results are shown in graph below Looking at the results of graph above it is obvious that younger people prefer to communicate with companies through more innovative platforms such as social media online videos and apps I have to admit that the targeted group between and years old are no teenagers but still the difference with older age groups is clear In my opinion teenagers should prefer social media online videos and apps even more Given the importance of teenagers for companies and advertisers and Facebooks intention to sell as many advertisements as possible it is clear that engagement of teenagers with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is important for investors as well The higher the engagement of teenagers the more advertisements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be able to sell From this perspective the reports of Facebooks declining popularity among teenagers could threaten the companies future revenue growth How will Facebooks move toward music fit in to win back popularity among teenagers As I mentioned before teenagers are using other social media platforms and online services in favor of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Interesting is that the fastest growing service among teenagers is music streaming service Spotify see below It is no secret that streaming services such as Spotify are growing fast but it seems that teenagers are driving growth Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could win back popularity among teenagers if the company offers music streaming services on its own In my opinion Facebooks plans to introduce both music video and audio streaming services are important for the companys future revenue growth Teenagers are an important group for selling advertisements and this group losing interest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could harm the companys growth prospects However teenagers are very interested in music streaming services considering the growth of teens using music streaming services like Spotify Therefore the introduction of Facebooks music video and audio streaming services are likely to have a positive influence on teenagers engagement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be able to counter the potential threat of losing more popularity among teenagers and sell advertisements Besides regaining popularity among teenagers Facebooks decision to move towards music video and audio services enables the company to earn additional revenue According to Musically the video platform will be a separate box featuring selected video content The advertisements will show between videos Based on this first indication it seems that video advertisements will not be replace other advertisements on Facebooks platform However this conclusion may be premature as the final version of the video service is still unknown Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be able to generate subscription revenue in case the company introduces an audio streaming service Unlike previous research on Seeking Alpha I am positive about Facebooks move toward music Music streaming services are very popular and growing Based on information mentioned above it is clear that teenagers are an important reasons behind these services growth Facebooks music business will be an important factor to win back teenagers interest in the platform By winning back teenagers interest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>counters a potential threat to its future growth because teenagers are an important age group for advertisers Without teenagers interest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is could sell less ads in the future However I believe music services will prove a good tool for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to take away this threat Therefore the companys growth model is intact and I am positive about the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is monetizing its platform This will be a boost for the companys share price going forward Source Music Will Be Key For <span style='background-color:
