this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Seeking Alpha contributor BayesianLerner has raised the prospect that Netflix could plummet as badly as GoPro has Other views are less bearish Estimize expects Netflix to beat Wall Streets consensus in its Q earnings release and Portfolio Armor estimates a low but positive potential return for the stock Could Netflix NASDAQ NFLX pull a GoPro NASDAQ GPRO Seeking Alpha contributor BayesianLearner raised that question in a recent article Netflix Might Pull A GoPro This Year basing his bearishness in part on his European perspective arguing that nonUS Netflix sucks In a recent article Limiting Your Losses On GoPro we wrote about how a hedge on GoPro significantly limited downside for GoPro shareholders The stock is now down since we wrote our October article thanks to the hedge GoPro investors were down only as of January th In this article we post an optimal collar hedge Netflix shareholders can use to limit their downside risk on the stock First though well consider two more perspectives on Netflixs prospects in addition to BayesianLearners bearish one and a quick explanation of hedging terms As the chart below from Estimize shows Netflix managements guidance was cents per share for its upcoming release of its FQ earnings the Wall Street consensus was cents per share and the average estimate of Estimizes community of Netflix analysts was cents per share Every trading day Portfolio Armor ranks every hedgeable stock and exchangetraded product such as ETFs by its potential return Potential return in our terminology is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next months As of Fridays close the site calculated a potential return of for Netflix By way of comparison this was the nd worst potential return the site calculated for FANG stocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB had the lowest potential return at Alphabet Class A shares NASDAQ GOOGL were ndhighest with a potential return of and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN had the highest potential return of any security at Recall that puts short for put options are contracts that give you the right to sell a security for a specified price the strike price before a specified date the expiration date And calls short for call options are contracts that give you the right to sell security for a specified price before a specified date A collar is a type of hedge in which you buy a put option for protection and at the same time sell a call option which gives another investor the right to buy the security from you at a higher strike price by the same expiration date The proceeds from selling the call option can offset at least part of the cost of buying the put option An optimal collar is a collar that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest price while not capping your possible upside by more than you specify In a nutshell with a collar you may be able to reduce the cost of hedging in return for giving up some possible upside Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find an optimal collar to hedge Netflix below but you dont need the app to do this you can find optimal collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app two pieces of information youll need to supply in addition to the number of shares youre looking to hedge are your cap and your threshold Cap refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a month period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap you dont think the security is going to do better than that so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that For the example below we started off using a cap of the potential return our site calculated for Netflix but we raised it to because that was as high as we could raise it without raising the hedging cost All else equal though the lower the cap the less expensive it will be to hedge The other term threshold refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purposes of the example below weve used a threshold of If you are more risk averse you could use a smaller threshold and you are less risk averse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge As of Fridays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of NFLX against a drop over the next several months while not capping an investors upside by less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or as a percentage of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was negative meaning an investor would have collected more from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts Note that too be conservative the cost of the hedge above was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls in practice an investor can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and the ask and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar Although the threshold on this collar is and thresholds are calculated to take into account positive hedging costs they dont take into account negative hedging costs So the worst case scenario in this case when taking into account the hedging cost would be a decline of less than assuming conservatively a negative cost of the maximum drawdown here would be Similarly the best case scenario wouldnt be the level at which this collar is capped but Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy Services </div></body></html>
