Sector SPDR ETF NYSEARCA XLK which tracks the SP Information Technology Select Index NYSEIXT has been on a sharp rebound since plunging to the February th low of per share when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told the US Congress on the second day of her twoday semiannual monetary policy report that overseas weakness and market distress could threaten the Feds plans to raise the rate but didnt

Technology has the largest overseas earnings and the most dollar exposure of all the SP sectors A new threat for Apple NASDAQ AAPL the top holding of XLK emerged in February after Apple received a court order directing them to help the FBI break into the iPhone used by one of perpetrators of the San Bernardino terrorist attack last year Apple is refusing to comply In fact public attention has been diverted from the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil to Apple and the governments claims of obstructing the Federal criminal investigation In the middle of the heated debate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump jumped onto the band wagon and called for a boycott of all Apple products in light of the companys reluctance to help authorities hack into the iPhone in question If the dark cloud over Apple shares from this new threat was excluded our estimation has shown that XLK would have closed between and per share today instead of per share Apple and DOJ Threat According to Zacks the Department of Justice or DOJ argued that the case isnt about creating a backdoor for circumventing iOS encryption and security but merely requests the unlocking of one specific iPhone used by the perpetrator in the San Bernardino terrorist attack If Apple doesnt comply the DOJ could demand that Apple turn over its iPhone software source code along with the encrypted signing key With the source code and private encryption keys the FBI would have enough power to develop its own software which could become an effective tool to track people Apple plans to appeal and the appeals process could very well go all the way to the Supreme Court and drag on for years after President Obama leaves office Alphabet Inc Class A NASDAQ GOOGL and Class C NASDAQ GOOG Microsoft Corp
