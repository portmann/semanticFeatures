vs Fitbit Blaze competition and the overall wearables category Clarity will show Fitbit to be an oversold opportunity House cleaning Providing documentation of early results showing Blaze was indeed sold out of stock may be helpful The market sold Fitbit based upon the view that Apple Watch would crush Fitbit Blaze The market was wrong Now the rebound is taking place Fitbit experienced an unjustified selloff from to during January February of this year The move back upwards to correct this oversold condition has just begun Shares of Fitbit are up almost from their February bottom to Citibanks price target of is reasonable but there is a sense of urgency to get involved Please use this hypertext link to check this Steps ad the play button on the still image above is not interactive This ad is shared by Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Alexa and Fitbits NYSE FIT Blaze The ad features former NBA stars Steve Smith and Grant Hill and is being run during primetime spots on this years NCAA tourney While the ad is both effective and amusing it communicates that two premier consumer brands worldwide Amazon and Fitbit have strengthened their relationship The future of wearables is upon us and this increasingly important categorys leader Fitbit may one day receive the premium valuation that is definitely deserved We have recently presented several articles discussing some of the key aspects impacting the wearables category and a few of its key players such as Fitbit Apple NASDAQ AAPL and the most recent entry into wearables from Under Armour NYSE UA Numerous negative consumer reviews have been posted on UAs own website for their Health Box and UA Band products This negative consumer feedback supports our recent article Under Armour Health Box And UA Band Unable To Compete With Fitbit With the early feedback on the UA wearables product launch looking weak this article will focus on the developing news that Fitbits Blaze is indeed cleaning the clock of Apple Watch in the marketplace If the assertion that Blaze is competing well against the Apple Watch is accurate then it could lead to a sharp increase in the price of FIT shares On almost a daily basis we are getting feedback from early retail channel checks consumers as well as from Fitbit that the sales of the recently launched Blaze smart fitness watch product are very strong The same strong sales indications for Fitbits other new product launch Alta indicates another strong year of sales growth for Fitbit is in the making This developing success of both new products Blaze and Alta is definitely not yet factored into the current price of the stock Because Fitbit has dominated the fitness tracker subcategory of wearables and Apple Watch has dominated the smartwatch subcategory the Blaze is the first Fitbit product to step onto Apple Watchs turf in direct competition For some background on this head to head turf war please reference our recent article entitled Apple Watch Vs Fitbit Blaze The Early Winner May Surprise You There is still a great deal of confusion and misinformation on the overall wearables category as well as the undervalued shares of FIT This article will attempt to lend clarity to several key issues in an effort to dispel the confusion and misinformation surrounding the Apple vs Fitbit competition and which is winning this battle for market share in the smartwatch subcategory of wearables Clarity of understanding will likely drive the price of FIT shares higher Slowly but surely the market is beginning to understand Fitbit and wearables and this will cause shares of FIT to trade higher My goal is to help SA readers understand this opportunity ahead of the Street Lets be crystal clear from the outset With tripledigit growth of in the category for wearables are not a zerosum game A highgrowth category such as wearables will support at least several winning companies for many years into the future Fitbit is currently the clear winner in the category with firstmover advantages but we are hopeful that Apple will continue to contribute to the growth and innovation in this important industry going forward Wearables can make a significant difference in the quality of peoples lives via the mHealth and preventive healthcare applications that are becoming increasingly prevalent in the category Apples HealthKit app for iPhones is significant but CEO Tim Cook failed to mention in the webcast from Cupertino that this app also is available for the Apple Watch OS For the benefit of Apple shareholders and the mHealthwearables category we would like to see Apple commit far greater resources and focus to the advancement of the Apple Watch Fitbit is highly focused on its mission in wearables and has been building an RD army that now comprises an entire twothirds people in RD of all employees If you dont believe that Fitbit is going to accelerate innovation to become an even greater powerhouse in wearables and mHealth then consider both the quantity and quality of talent being attracted by Fitbit across the country and even in its eastern European location of Minsk Belarus Those who believe that entrance into the wearables category can be achieved by sticking a glorified pedometer onto a rubber band are living in the Stone Age The age of hightech wearables is upon us now albeit in a nascent stage and there is an increasing barrier to entry that exists now Below is an important graphic that displays the only competitive companies in wearables at this time please disregard the media hyperbole regarding hordes of competitors in wearables It is noteworthy that the categorys leader Fitbit took back market share from competitors during the important Q holiday period This article also will present the case that the recent selloff in FIT shares from down to was unjustified and is now beginning to correct back upwards to the preJanuary th CES announcement by Fitbit of its Blaze smart fitness watch Shares of FIT have appreciated nearly from their February low Since the market will eventually arrive at the truth regarding Fitbit and wearables as it almost always does presenting this opportunity to investors early while the stock is still oversold will hopefully prove highly profitable for readers A statement we made in a previous SA article that Fitbit Blaze has been literally selling out of big box retailers needs documentation So lets clear up any doubts by using two screen shots one hyperlink and a report from BofAMerrill Lynch Please find below a screen shot of a recent Live Chat from Best Buy NYSE BBY that documents some of the retail channel check efforts Apologies that the undersized screen shot below will not fit into the SA Article Wizard better Please use whatever feature that your PC offers to enlarge this screen shot The screen shot documents that the Fitbit Blaze was indeed out of stock for about a month according to customer service rep Annebel R In fact please note that the CSR confirms at least four separate times that the Blaze was out of stock Importantly she also mentions that Blaze may go out of stock again due to high demand sellthrough and that they are trying to catch up on back orders for Blaze When asked about the Apple Watch supply she says we have enough Best Buy is representative of the experiences that we have had with every channel check completed for big box retailers For those of us doing the due diligence numerous indications that the Blaze was sold out were obvious across several retailers as it was being launched When you find a clue like the following <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post then you simply do the work to follow up and channel check This is how we knew that Blaze was selling out prior to the reports issued by a few major analysts We began reporting this wellearned due diligence to the SA readership in prior articles ahead of the confirmations of Blaze sales by major investment firm analysts Please note that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post by a consumer Ms Jazmin Mendoza accurately matches the information from the consumer rep Annebel R who also stated that the Blaze was out of stock for almost a month We followed up on this investigative due diligence regarding the Blaze being sold out of stock which was tipped off to us by several clues including huge presales of Blaze For those who listened to CFO Zerellas webcasts at different investment conferences it was clear that Blaze and Alta presales had exceeded expectations Afterwards major analysts began to confirm what we had discovered A simple keyword search performed during daily due diligence uncovered the following major analyst report by BofAMerrill Lynch All of these items lead up to our accurate statement that Fitbit Blaze has literally been selling out of big box retailers Here is another statement in our previous article Fitbit Blaze is outselling the Apple Watch by at least a ratio on Amazon at the time of this writing Now it should be noted that the same due diligence link as follows also appeared in the previous article So there was no excuse if anybody missed this retail check Here is that same link once again in case anybody missed it the first time around Check this Amazon link to Best Selling Smart Watches and decide for yourself if our statement was accurate Of course the actual rankings change from day to day but as I write this Fitbits Blaze holds the top four ranked positions and also the number six position for best selling smart watches on Amazon While reviewing the list please throw out the few watches priced under that are included in the rankings since these manufacturers are insignificant for our discussion Apple Watch holds the number eight position on this Amazon list So if Fitbit Blaze holds all of the positions for the top four ranked best selling smart watches and also the number six position as well and Apple Watch only holds the number eight position then isnt it safe to say that Fitbit Blaze is outselling the Apple Watch by at least a ratio on Amazon The ratio that I used is actually overly conservative since holding the number one ranked spot alone might give the Blaze more than a ratio in sales over Apples number eight ranking But when the Blaze occupies all of the top four ranked best sellers and also the number six ranked spot as well in comparison to the Apple Watchs number eight ranked spot the ratio of Blaze sales to every Apple Watch sale on Amazon is easily at the time of this writing It is understood that Apple sells its products through its own stores both Apple and Fitbit also sell product via company websites Still the Amazon channel is an increasingly significant retail check and cannot be ignored as it is a valid reflection of the general marketplace just as Best Buy is a significant channel check on the rate of retail sales at big box stores We look forward to the upcoming several quarters of IDC sales reports to confirm the trend of early sales indications that Fitbits Blaze is indeed competing well and taking market share from Apples Watch We are always glad to confirm the credibility of our statements and document the value of our accurate and proper due diligence The two screen shots above combined with the BofAMerrill Lynch report and the link to the Amazon best sellers page all confirm that the statements in our previous article were accurate It is noteworthy that our channel checks uncovered Blaze being sold out of stock prior to this event being reported by major firms research Good for us And more importantly good for our readers and the SA forum The important takeaway here is that the market sold off shares of FIT from down to based upon the errant assumption that Apple would crush Fitbits Blaze Now the market is beginning to learn the opposite is occurring Fitbit Blaze is not only competing well but is actually outselling the Apple Watch per several key retail checks on Amazon Best Buy and other major retailers Again no data exists for the rate of Apple Watch sales from Apple stores or website Fitbits own website has been having great success selling the Blaze product It is clear that the reason for the plunge in FIT shares down from is unjustified and that the selloff should now correct itself back upwards Fitbits Blaze is not being crushed it is competing well and Blaze is taking market share from the Apple Watch in the smartwatch subcategory This surprise to the market which has gotten this event totally wrong is reason enough to correct the unjustified selloff back to Along with the improvement of the overall market this developing news on Blaze sales is likely a part of the reason for the almost increase in the price of FIT shares since February As it becomes clear to the rest of the market that Fitbit Blaze is competing well and possibly even outselling Apple Watch we are likely to see significant short covering FIT has one of the highest short interests in the entire stock market It is notable that the second of the two graphics below indicates short covering has begun during the latest time period reported Past is not prologue The idea that because a stock is down over a period of time there must be problems at the company is not always accurate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NYSE FB is one of many examples of the market getting the story wrong after the companys IPO But once the market figured out the truth the stock of FB rallied strongly While the price of FIT shares have sold off since their peak on August the fundamentals at the company are tremendous and getting stronger by the quarter Fitbit is the industry leader of a highgrowth wearables category with company sales up YOY for Q zero debt almost million in cash two successful new products recently launched and Fitbit demonstrated that it took back market share from the No and No companies in the category during the important Q holiday period Investors on Wall Street almost always figure out the truth on a stock eventually Fitbit will be no different An industryleading stock with the strength of fundamentals enjoyed by FIT should receive a premium valuation in the marketplace Instead FIT trades at a steep discount FIT currently has a forward PE of only Lets be candid this is insane for a stock that just grew sales at and has a brilliant future with many years of high growth ahead To give you some reference points for how cheap this valuation is the forward PE for Amazon is about and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is about If you feel that FIT is not in the same league with either of those stocks at this time in its development then perhaps FIT should only have a forward PE of a more modest This type of valuation is very reasonable for the worldwide leader of a highgrowth industry It means that the price of FIT shares can triple from current levels to about price per share and still be considered cheap by some measures The PEG ratio is only when a PEG of is considered fair value By all measures FIT is way oversold The upcoming May earnings report for Q is likely to deliver both a beat and a raise for fullyear guidance according to indications by CFO Zerella who said that they would have better vision after receiving the first quarter numbers The stronger than expected Blaze and Alta sales make this beat and raise scenario very likely Lets complete this article by presenting a bull case for shares of FIT to correct the unjustified selloff that took the stock down from to during JanuaryFebruary Here are the five key factors that all combined to be prevalent on January to create a perfect storm that led to the selloff of FIT and the reasons why each of these five factors are now unjustified The overall market was in a sharp corrective phase during JanuaryFebruary Markets have rebounded and are at about breakeven now Shares of Fitbit have not rebounded to yet A classaction lawsuit that Fitbit vigorously contends is meritless was announced on the same day as the Blaze product announcement on day one of CES January th Only about of all class action lawsuits ever receive certification by a judge to proceed One of the qualifications for certification is that persons are included in the class This lawsuit was filed with only three persons The class action in part contends that Fitbits patented PurePulse technology for monitoring heart rate is inaccurate However the independent and highly credible organization Consumer Reports has conducted tests on this heart rate monitor on two separate occasions Consumer Reports has found that Fitbits heart rate monitor technology is very accurate Please view this short video by Consumer Reports on their study and findings It is possible that this classaction lawsuit will never even see the inside of a courtroom And even if the lawsuit did make it into court it is unlikely to succeed or have any material impact upon Fitbit or the price of its stock It would seem that what Fitbit calls a meritless claim will now achieve diminishing returns for shorts going forward The classaction lawsuit may be a moot point now Under Armour announced their new wearables product Health Box and UA Band during CES at about the same time as Fitbit announced Blaze The media and selfproclaimed experts have the wrong idea that any company can enter the wearables category and if it is a major company then they are certain to be successful and Fitbit is certain to suffer significant loss of market share Nothing could be further from the truth If wearables were an easy category to enter then why did Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL fail Nike NYSE NKE quit Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT first band failed and now their second band is struggling with small market share Jawbone PRIVATE JAW is also struggling with small market share and now the Under Armour wearables product has numerous negative consumer reviews on its own website just a few weeks after the products launch These negative reviews support our recent article published on the Under Armour wearables product on SA and is linked at the top of this article The fact is that wearables have become a category with a defensible moat that is steadily growing into a higher barrier for entry When we look at four of the top five wearables vendors in the category we see that each of them have invested substantial resources into building an inhouse RD effort that is very expensive and resource intensive The IDC report below shows that there are only five competitors with over market share in the entire wearables category Due to being overpriced and late to market with extremely disappointing technology that has numerous fatal flaws Under Armours product is unlikely to gain significant market share in this competitive category The weak Under Armour product will not threaten Fitbits dominance in the category The release of this UA product is basically a nonevent for Fitbit and the marketplace will recognize this emerging fact Another fundamental misconception has been that there are huge numbers of competitors in wearables all battling for crumbs of market share This is not exactly accurate Again please refer to the IDC report above There is your entire wearables category that consists of only five companies with any significant market share The IDC determined that if a company could not scratch out market share than they were lumped together in the Others category As the overall categorys growth has now begun to slow wearables growth was for all of but only for Q which indicates slowing growth albeit still high growth then the inevitable shakeout will begin where the weaker competitors are forced out of the market While the number of companies trapped in the Others category with low market share will likely suffer the Top Five leader board will likely benefit as these other weaker competitors fail The market is just beginning to understand the fact that the wearables category is limited to only a few key players with Fitbit being the undisputed worldwide leader And here is the big reason that the market chose to selloff shares of FIT from down to Check the price action for FIT on January th when Blaze was announced as well as the classaction lawsuit and you will see the stock was down about that day This day one selloff was followed by four more consecutive down days that started the selling all the way down to below in February The overwhelming sentiment was that the Apple Watch was going to crush Fitbits new smart fitness watch called Blaze In fact social media was flush with posts that even the name Blaze was indicative that the product would crash and burn while many media and experts acted shocked and derisive that Fitbit would even contemplate such a disastrous move to compete directly with the Apple Watch After all wasnt the only thing saving Fitbit the fact that Apples smartwatch was in a different subcategory of wearables than Fitbits fitness trackers So how could Fitbit be so crazy to step onto the Apple Watchs turf and engage in direct competition This was the overwhelming consensus in JanuaryFebruary that the Blaze was going to get crushed by the Apple Watch and devastate Fitbits chances for any future Sounds dramatic but if you were paying close attention at the time this was exactly the tone of the debate Now here we are in March and the early news on the Fitbit Blaze vs Apple Watch turf battle is heavily in favor of the Blaze being the early winner Even if you are unwilling to acknowledge that Blaze is beating the Watch and taking market share from Apple then you certainly must concede that Blaze is not getting crushed as the market expected And if you can concede only this much as the market will also have to concede very soon then this is enough for the unjustified selloff to correct back higher Summary By all metrics shares of FIT are very oversold And the reasons for the recent sharp selloff are all unjustified The skyhigh short interest in FIT has a terrible riskreward ratio an expensive borrow rate and recently increased margin requirements The short ended in February and the stock is up since then with a tremendous amount of upside threatening shorts in the very near future Looking forward we conclude that the overcrowded short side of the trade must cover or risk severe losses in the near term Clearly the Blaze is competing exceptionally well against the Apple Watch and taking market share away from the Watch This is significant The upcoming IDC report will quantify what the early numbers look like for Q although Blaze only started shipping in March So the Fitbit May earnings report and conference call will also be very interesting to see how strong both Blaze and Alta have been in the marketplace Also it is highly likely that we will see a Q beat and a raise of fullyear guidance for this first quarter earnings report in a few weeks CFO Zerellas comments during several recent investment conferences have indicated as much In particular Fitbit has received reorders on the Blaze product that was not included in the conservative Q guidance The Fitbit BlazeAmazon Alexa relationship is going to gain momentum as this partnership is mutually beneficial for both companies It is genius for Fitbit to have engaged themselves with one of the worlds largest ecommerce companies Also the possibility is high for upside surprises as Fitbit has stated that there would be further product releases and corporate developments in Certainly we are due for an update of the booming corporategovernment wellness business The nearterm future for Fitbit is very bright and there are multiple catalysts close at hand that could trigger a significant and rapid increase in the price of FIT shares as this stock continues its recent upside move as it takes back the unjustified selloff and trades back into the s This price target represents a reasonable valuation for this highgrowth industry leader with excellent fundamentals and successful new products We will continue to follow wearables closely with a focus on Fitbit Apple and other significant companies and events Stay tuned and good luck
