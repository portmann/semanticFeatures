Another court lifted that suspension shortly afterward Mondays suspension angered many in Brazil where the service is used by individuals companies and federal and local governments to send messages and share pictures and videos Costconscious Brazilians are avid users of free messaging apps and WhatsApp is by far the most popular installed on more than percent of Android devices As some

Letcia Mendes a yearold shop assistant in Rio de Janeiro said she was frustrated by the suspension because it could force people to use pay services Its really bad she told Reuters Its just a way of getting more money out of us when we already have to pay for so many things The suspension came as a congressional commission on cyber crime in Brazil debated changes to the legislation governing the use of the Internet Lower house deputy Esperidio Amin the rapporteur of the commission said his proposed reform would help avoid shutdowns of this kind by allowing the blocking of specific individuals or IP addresses suspected of illicit activity rather than the access of all users Its less dramatic than withdrawing the service from the whole of the Brazilian population he told Reuters by telephone
