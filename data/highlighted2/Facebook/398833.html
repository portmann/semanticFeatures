visionary leader thinks outside of the box and constantly utilizes what Howard Marks calls secondlevel thinking Secondlevel thinking integrates complex dynamic and bold approaches to problemsolving and idea generation well beyond traditional modes of thinking Comparing Tim Cook to other tech sector leaders demonstrates the urgent need for Apple to find new leadership Apple will only correct course once it brings in a new visionary leader like these other tech sector titans who continuously utilize secondlevel thinking to drive innovation and create growth Tim Cooks response to Apples NASDAQ AAPL poor Q results has been conventional Instead of declaring the urgent need to innovate and create new channels of growth Cook responded by increasing Apples share buyback program by billion and upping the quarterly dividend by This conventional response to Apples lack of growth is a tactic that could have been used by any average manager and demonstrates a lack of visionary leadership To be fair supporters of Tim Cook will readily point out numerous redemptive actions he is taking to deal with Apples current set of problems For example Cook is actively responding to investor criticism and went on Jim Cramers Mad Money to defend his actions He highlighted how Apple had an incredible quarter by absolute standards noting sales of billion for the quarter and profits of billion Responding to Carl Icahns pessimism over China Cook argued that the Chinese middle class is booming and that he could not be more optimistic about its future In addition Apple could continue to see growth in emerging markets like India Plus the share buybacks increase shareholder value and higher dividends attract yieldfocused investors On a basic empirical level all of this sounds good and well But none of this charts out a fundamentally new path for Apples longterm innovation or growth Instead it charts a path to continue growing iPhone profits and does not seriously or fully address the urgent need for new channels of growth Although Cook did hint at the possibility of a large acquisition it is unlikely that any large acquisition will be the fundamental driver for new channels of growth Ultimately these actions fall neatly in line with my argument that Tim Cook is not a visionary leader He is not offering investors a visionary plan to push Apple out of its current rut Instead he continues to respond in conventional ways like focusing on increasing iPhone sales in emerging markets Although the iPhone will remain Apples bread and butter product for the foreseeable future this will not be a radically new driver for innovation or growth The various challenges facing Apple today can only be fixed with visionary leadership The iPhone is now ten years old and Apple will eventually need a new driver of growth This new driver of growth will come through visionary leadership Apple needs a visionary leader to change course Looking at examples of several tech sector titans helps demonstrate how critical visionary leadership is to forge a new direction for Apple These successful tech sector titans help demonstrate the urgent need for a new visionary leader at Apple to jumpstart a new era of innovation and growth Understanding visionary leadership and how this adds value to a company is critical to understand Apples prospect In fact in the most significant criticism I received on my previous piece looking at the visionary leadership a commenter argued To address these criticisms the first point to unpack is what a visionary leader is A visionary leader is an individual who thinks outside of the box and constantly utilizes secondlevel thinking Howard Marks explains the difference between first and secondlevel thinking in his book The Most Important Thing Firstlevel thinking is superficial and is conducted by your average manager like Tim Cook Here a manager utilizes typical methods to improve a companys fate For example if a company has lots of cash and wants to increase shareholder value a firstlevel thinker would follow the common strategy of instituting a share buyback program and perhaps increase dividends But this average way of thinking is what any manager could do and will not lead to innovation or outsized returns In contrast secondlevel thinking is deep difficult and oftentimes controversial This is the defining characteristic of visionary leaders because they will do whatever it takes to ensure their vision comes to fruition For example in when Steve Jobs came back to Apple he didnt follow any conventional framework to turn the company around Instead he cut jobs reduced product lines and created a partnership with archenemy Microsoft But these radical steps were taken in order to follow through on his vision to fundamentally turn around Apple His success came from being unconventional taking risks and utilizing complex thinking to follow through on his vision What Apple needs right now more than anything else is a visionary leader who utilizes secondlevel thinking to move things forward As the chart below from the Marks book illustrates unconventional behavior driven by secondlevel thinking can lead to aboveaverage results The best companies in the tech sector today are led by visionary leaders utilizing secondlevel thinking to drive innovation This thinking has led to excellent results outsized returns and strong investor enthusiasm Comparing these companies with Apple helps illustrate the crucial need for new visionary leadership Elon Musk is hands down the most visionary CEO of any company in the world today Not only is he the CEO of both Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and SpaceX Private SPACE but he has an overarching vision for solving the biggest problems in the world today As such investors have bought into his vision for changing the world one car at a time Investors continue to evaluate Tesla based on its potential in spite of massive capex burn and a current lack of profitability At the same time he is running SpaceX and plans on sending humans to Mars in the s Although many question his tactics and theatrics investors believe in him and continue to support his outofthisworld initiatives Jeff Bezos is arguably the second most visionary CEO in the world today He has transformed Amazon NASDAQ AMZN from a company originally conceived as an online bookstore to become an increasingly diversified online retailer and service provider He notes in his shareholder letter this year how he wants Amazon to be a large company thats also an invention machine Because of this ethos Amazon is the fastest company to ever reach billion in annual sales And just like Musk his private aerospace company Blue Origin Private BORGN continues to expand its space operations Mark Zuckerberg is using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB to create a new vision for the future This future involves virtual reality and humans interacting with chatbots through the Messenger Platform Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>trailed MySpace early on in its history his visionary leadership has fundamentally transformed the company into the dominant social media platform today It has gone from being just a limited social media network for college students to become one of the most important ways many people stay connected All of this has led <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to achieve one of the highest valuations of any company in the world Satya Nadella is different from the previous three tech titans because he did not create the company he now runs Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT used to be the biggest tech titan before being displaced by Apple But since Nadella became CEO in he continues to utilize secondorder thinking to reinvigorate Microsoft Microsoft has found its mojo through Nadellas visionary leadership His emphasis on innovation and new drivers of growth has led Azure to become the second largest cloud service provider on the market In addition the Windows OS is a success and continues to be wellreceived His leadership continues to impress investors who now view Microsoft as a strong growth company Apple needs a leader who can apply the numerous lessons from these successful tech sector companies to help get out of its rut It needs a leader like Musk who can inspire investor and consumer confidence It needs a leader like Bezos who can continue to plow profits back into the company to ensure growth It needs a leader like Zuckerberg to find innovative ways to grow its core competencies It needs a leader like Nadella to create new products to drive future growth The market recognizes the achievements of these visionary leaders The last leader of this group to become CEO is Satya Nadella If we compare the share price appreciation of each of these companies with one another since Nadella became CEO on February the facts speak for themselves In spite of the buybacks dividends the Apple Watch and everything else Apple has seen the least amount of share price appreciation with shares up only since then In fact Apple has seen even less share price appreciation than Tesla which has yet to demonstrate profitability and even went through a round of dilution in All of this demonstrates how value is added to companies with visionary leaders These leaders drive new avenues of growth and innovation This then translates into investor enthusiasm and higher share prices Apple should recognize this and bring in new visionary leadership Just like Microsoft brought in a visionary leader adept at secondlevel thinking so too should Apple bring in a new visionary leader All of these tech companies except Apple share the common feature of having visionary leaders at the helm Consequently all are trading at much higher multiples than Apple have seen more significant share price appreciation and investors continue to give these companies the benefit of the doubt Although Apple may have needed Tim Cook to manage a transition from the Steve Jobs era it now needs new leadership at the top A new visionary leader who effectively utilizes secondlevel thinking is what will lead to a turnaround at Apple today Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MSFT AMZN I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
