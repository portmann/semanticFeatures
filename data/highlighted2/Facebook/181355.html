Instagrams mobile ad revenue will surpass both Twitters NYSE TWTR and Googles NASDAQ GOOG by and we believe that eMarketers billion mobile ad revenue figure for Instagram in is actually conservative considering newly opened international growth opportunities Growing domestic popularity among the key teen demographic coupled with these newly opened international growth opportunities ensures that Instagram will become a sizeable piece of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ad revenue pie in the near future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>makes its money from advertisements and the biggest section of advertising is mobile advertising Advertising comprised roughly of Facebooks net revenues through the first months of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>estimates that about of total advertising revenue in the second quarter was from mobile advertising That is billion in mobile advertising revenue in Q for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Annualized that is an billion run rate for mobile advertising Thats a big number and we believe that number is set to explode more than most believe thanks to what we believe is the worlds most potent social media app for advertisers Instagram Instagram is not only one of the fastest growing and most popular social media platforms but its popularity is strongest among the key youth demographic Instagram is the top social networking site used by US teens with roughly of teens using Instagram according to Piper Jaffray This represents a percentage point increase since which makes it the fastest growing social media platform among teens in that time period This is especially important considering Facebooks popularity among US teens is dwindling from usage in to a in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now the third most important social network among US teens and only percentage point ahead of newcomer Snapchat The ramping popularity of Instagram among a young demographic in the United States ensures the longevity of Facebooks advertising revenue As it turns out Instagram isnt only growing on teens but adult online users as well While we believe this demographic is less important for ensuring advertising revenue longevity we do believe it is important for current advertising prowess and displays that Instagram is more than just a kids application Instagram was the fastest growing social media platform from to among online adults roughly doubling adult audience penetration in that time frame according to Pew Research Facebooks growth has steadied while Twitter Pinterest and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD grew at slower rates Instagram has a crossgenerational appeal that ensures high advertising demand and this is captured in Instagram crossing the million users milestone According to Debra Aho Williamson eMarketer principal analyst Instagrams new ad products including direct response the ability to buy ads via an API and enhanced targeting features are generating high demand for Instagram advertising space among advertisers Now that Instagram is opening up there is a lot of pentup demand The rollout of new features over the next several months means that by the end of Instagram will have a host of new ad products for advertisers large and small In particular Instagram advertisers will be able to use a full slate of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>targeting tools including the popular Custom Audiences feature That will be a key drawing card This makes sense to us as Instagrams popularity among teens constitutes Instagram as perhaps the ideal advertising space for teentailored products and in an industry where the consumer teens is being swayed more and more by what they see online we believe competition will be especially keen for Instagram advertising space eMarketer pegs Instagrams worldwide mobile ad revenue at million for and believes this will constitute of Facebooks total ad revenues By eMarketer believes Instagram will rake in billion in net mobile ad revenues worldwide good enough for what eMarketer estimates to be of Facebooks total ad revenue eMarketer believes that of that billion in mobile ads revenue worldwide billion will come from the United States At billion Instagrams US mobile display ad revenues will be greater than both Twitters and Googles eMarketer released their report in July At that time Instagram advertising was only available in seven international markets Since then Instagram has announced that it will be launching ads in new countries on September including large markets like Italy Spain Mexico India and South Korea From this standpoint we believe the eMarketer worldwide estimate for billion mobile ads revenue by is actually conservative as it assumes only a mix from international markets when of Instagrams user base is international Additionally considering that soon international markets will support Instagram ads as opposed to just as of July and we believe the international mix will be much larger than Because we do not believe domestic advertising will be affected by international expansion we believe the billion estimate is actually very conservative Adoption of the iPhone s and Plus has been surprisingly strong and urbanization should further help smartphone sales globally and increase Instagrams users concurrently more smartphones more potential Instagram users Instagrams user base should see significant gains in particular due to urbanization in developing countries In roughly of the worlds population lived in urban areas and the global urban mix is expected to increase to by Studies show that urbanization coupled with global population growth will mean an extra billion people living in urban areas by Roughly of that growth will be attributed to Asia and Africa This urbanization of formerly rural areas will increase Instagrams reach and potential user pool and this will result in a tailwind effect for international mobile advertising revenue In our opinion Instagram will rake in more than billion in with the potential to rake in far more than billion As the smartphone market continues to grow driven by urbanization of rural areas Instagrams reach will only broaden and we believe that a matured Instagram business will bring in more than billion in advertising revenue per year a rate which some have pegged as the mature run rate At a billion run rate or higher we believe Instagrams mobile advertising revenue will be greater
