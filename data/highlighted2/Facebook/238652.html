class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB Stock Is Bad News On The Way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the worlds largest social network and by all measures it seems as though the company is doing relatively well However an insider recently offloaded an incredible amount of the stock This spells bad news for FB and investors are wondering exactly whats going on Today well talk about why insider sales are important for investors to watch the massive insider sale we saw on FB and what we can expect to see moving forward So lets get right to it Why Investors Should Watch Insider Sales No matter what stock youre watching its important to pay very close attention to insider sales Thats because no matter what company it is insiders know more about whats going on with the company than anyone else So when insiders buy massive amounts of shares we can expect to see growth in the stock from something thats developing at the moment at some time down the road Adversely when insiders sell large amounts of shares the action insinuates that the insider knows something that investors dont something thats likely to drive the price of the stock down relatively soon Marc Andreessen is a big part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In fact he has sat on the board of directors for the company since In fact in when Yahoo attempted to acquire FB Adreessen played a big role in consulting Zuckerberg in his decision to avoid selling the company In fact in a recent statement on the New Yorker Adreessen had the following to offer Every single person involved in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wanted Mark to take the Yahoo offer The psychological pressure they put on this yearold was intense Mark and I really bonded in that period because I told him Dont sell dont sell dont sell However it seems as though Andreessen believes that now is the perfect time to sell shares of the company According to his SEC filings Andreessen started selling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares on October th From then until now he has sold million shares Thats a value of million and equates to more than of his overall ownership of the company Why Did Andreessen Offload So Many Shares Ive taken a close look at the company and through my analysis I cant seem to figure out for the life of me why Andreessen would have sold so many shares All public information shows that the company is doing incredibly well However I do have a bit of a theory Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the largest social network in the world The company is so large in fact that just about everyone in developed countries already has a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account Recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced that they reached billion log ins in a single day All sounds good right Well that is if you dont account for market saturation Its possible that Andreessen sees that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has saturated the market so much that the company doesnt have much room left to grow As an analyst myself I know that when corporations are incapable of showing growth for any reason we tend to see declines in the values of the stocks that represent those companies With that said I wonder if the reason for the sale of the stock is that Andreessen feels as though the market high market saturation will lead to investor concerns in the future Why do you think Andreessen sold nearly three quarters of his ownership of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Let us know your opinions in the comments below If you enjoyed

Andreessen still sits on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>board and still owns more than million shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>All the research I did online says that it was a predetermined planned sale It may be that he is realizing his gains at the right time I dont see anything wrong with the <span style='background-color:
