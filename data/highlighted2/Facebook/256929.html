class='textDiv'>Social media companies step up battle against militant propaganda Reuters A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>logo is displayed on the side of a tour bus in New Yorks financial district July SAN FRANCISCO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Google and Twitter are stepping up efforts to combat online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants but the Internet companies are doing it quietly to avoid the perception that they are helping the authorities police the Web On Friday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc said it took down a profile that the company believed belonged to San Bernardino shooter Tashfeen Malik who with her husband is accused of killing people in a mass shooting that the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism Just a day earlier the French prime minister and European Commission officials met separately with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Google Twitter Inc and other companies to demand faster action on what the commission called online terrorism incitement and hate speech The Internet companies described their policies as straightforward they ban certain types of content in accordance with their own terms of service and require court orders to remove or block anything beyond that Anyone can report or flag content for review and possible removal But the truth is far more subtle and complicated According to former employees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Google and Twitter all worry that if they are public about their true level of cooperation with Western law enforcement agencies they will face endless demands for similar action from countries around the world They also fret about being perceived by consumers as being tools of the government Worse if the companies spell out exactly how their screening works they run the risk that technologically savvy militants will learn more about how to beat their systems If they knew what magic sauce went into pushing content into the newsfeed spammers or whomever would take advantage of that said a security expert who had worked at both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue One of the most significant yet least understood aspects of the propaganda issue is the range of ways in which social media companies deal with government officials <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Google and Twitter say they do not treat government complaints differently from citizen complaints unless the government obtains a court order The trio are among a growing number that publish regular transparency reports summarizing the number of formal requests from officials about content on their sites But there are workarounds according to former employees activists and government officials A key one is for officials or their allies to complain that a threat hate speech or celebration of violence violates the companys terms of service rather than any law Such content can be taken down within hours or minutes and without the paper trail that would go with a court order It is commonplace for federal authorities to directly contact Twitter and ask for assistance rather than going through formal channels said an activist who has helped get numerous accounts disabled In the San Bernardino case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said it took down Maliks profile established under an alias for violating its community standards which prohibit praise or promotion of acts of terror The spokesman said there was proIslamic State content on the page but declined to elaborate Some wellorganized online activists have also had success getting social media sites to remove content A Frenchspeaking activist using the Twitter alias NageAnon said he helped get rid of thousands of YouTube videos by spreading links of clear cases of policy violations and enlisting other volunteers to report them The more it gets reported the more it will get reviewed quickly and treated as an urgent case he said in a Twitter message to Reuters A person familiar with YouTubes operations said that company officials tend to quickly review videos that generate a high number of complaints relative to the number of views Relying on numbers can lead to other kinds of problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>suspended or restricted the accounts of many proWestern Ukrainians after they were accused of hate speech by multiple Russianspeaking users in what appeared to be a coordinated campaign said former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>security staffer Nick Bilogorskiy a Ukrainian immigrant who helped some of those accounts win appeals He said the complaints have leveled off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>declined to discuss these cases What law enforcement politicians and some activists would really like is for Internet companies to stop banned content from being shared in the first place But that would pose a tremendous technological challenge as well as an enormous policy shift former executives said Some child pornography can be blocked because the technology companies have access to a database that identifies previously known images A similar type of system is in place for copyrighted music There is no database for videos of violent acts and the same footage that might violate a social networks terms of service if uploaded by an anonymous militant might pass if it were part of a news broadcast Nicole Wong who previously served as the White Houses deputy chief technology officer said tech companies would be reluctant to create a database of jihadists videos even if it could be kept current enough to be relevant for fear that repressive governments would demand such setups to prescreen any content they do not like Technology companies are rightfully cautious because they are global players and if they build it for one purpose they dont get to say it cant be used for anything else said Wong a former Twitter and Google legal executive There have been some formal policy changes Twitter revised its abuse policy to ban indirect threats of violence in addition to direct threats and has dramatically improved its speed for handling abuse requests a spokesman said Across the board we respond to requests more quickly and its safe to say government requests are in that bunch the spokesman said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said it banned this year any content praising terrorists Googles YouTube has expanded a littleknown Trusted Flagger program allowing groups ranging from a British antiterror police unit to the Simon Wiesenthal Center a human rights organization to flag large numbers of videos as problematic and get immediate action A Google spokeswoman declined to say how many trusted flaggers there were but said the vast majority were individuals chosen based on their past accuracy in identifying content that violated YouTubes policies No US government agencies were part of the program though some nonprofit US entities have joined in the past year she said Theres no Wizard of Oz syndrome We send stuff in and we get an
