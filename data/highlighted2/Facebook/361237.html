class='textDiv'>Twitters Decision Day Is Coming Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Twitter will report Q earnings in about three weeks In the past week the company got some spark due to reported collaboration interest form MasterCard and Twitters successful NFL streaming bid In this article I lay out my expectations for Q earnings and summarize why I believe they will mark a turning point for Jack Dorsey and Twitter Twitter NYSE TWTR has had a good few days Shares are finally trading up a bit after a MasterCard NYSE MA executive commented on possible collaborations in the payment space More tangibly Twitter successfully acquired rights to stream some weekday NFL games Some analysts view this as a straightforward equation of NFL fans driving up Twitter engagement What is more Q earnings are around the corner and I believe these earnings will mark an inflection point for both the long and short thesis In this article I update my coverage and give my earnings outlook The partnership with the NFL will start next season ie from September onward Until then there will be two quarterly earnings calls in which management will have to own up to the central metric monthly active users MAUs Second the content Twitter is getting is neither original nor exclusive There are multiple issues with this deal The first one is simply the timeline Growing engagement from NFL fans would materialize at the beginning of at the earliest when Twitter reports QFY earnings As readers might know MAUs have stagnated at M worldwide and declined from M to M quarter over quarter in the US but were up M YoY If Q earnings show a further sequential decline in users the trend of ad buyers preferring other platforms will accelerate As it stands ad buyers prefer Instagram over Twitter and are flocking to Facebooks NASDAQ FB photo platform in staggering numbers Hence the NFL deal might simply be too late to matter if users a materially shrinking Network effects work both ways This week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB announced a new live video initiative by adding a video tab to the messengers navigation This native integration with other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>features like inviting friends to streams live videos in groups or events reaction emojis shows where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to go with video which I will explain in a moment Another Seeking Alpha contributor has recently called Twitter The King of Live I heavily dispute this claim Twitter is currently the king of one thing shortlived public disputes where people write things that make them look stupid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the undisputed king of social media and live messaging Snapchat Private CHAT is also particularly successful with a younger audience with both video and images and growing due to the defaultdelete nature of content Instagram is the king of photos YouTube is the king of usergenerated video content This study shows how Twitter has been losing out with a younger audience since Who will reign over live video Twitters NFL deal versus Facebooks live initiative gives us some pointers It seems the reason Twitter got this deal was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and the NFL had different perspectives on where to take live video From the following report which cites anonymous sources close to the deal The NFL felt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>undervalued content rights and has a poor monetization model The sources added that while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does have a large audience and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Lives platform is promising its ability to get revenue from live streaming as well as the products capability is still evolving whereas Twitters product is ready for prime time One digital media strategist for sports leagues agreed saying it was a widespread sportsworld sentiment that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>video ad revenue was a little underwhelming from what was expected This leads me to put together the following picture Twitter needs to finally show it can turn a profit The companys problems with outsized equity grants employee morale and executive compensation Anthony Noto anyone are wellknown Hence management is looking for direct revenue opportunities More bluntly Twitter is trying to squeeze out as much as it can from its nongrowing user base and was apparently willing to play ball with the NFL on the ads issue In contrast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is following the same recipe it has executed on with Instagram and WhatsApp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to win it all It does not to grow revenue from its video platform right away First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to sweep the live video market the same way it has taken the image market with Instagram or messaging with WhatsApp Given the companys record on product execution and its managements vision I view a success here as highly likely Further ad buyers will appreciate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can ultimately offer ads on all communication streams with the largest possible audience Q earnings are approaching and if user numbers are disappointing talking about loggedout users and the NFL will not help Jack Dorsey stopping Twitter from its death spiral If you are considering a long position in light of recent developments you should definitely wait out earnings to see whether products like Moments are showing results People dont like to bet on a losing horse Ad buyers want a growing platform or one that is at least stable in its niche Instead Twitter is getting squeezed on all ends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Snapchat YouTube Instagram Another disappointment will push ad buyers even further towards competitors I hence remain pessimistic on Twitter until proven otherwise Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Short Ideas Technology
