Hear insights on building privacy into products and helping people feel in control of their experiences Of the sessions listed above I am particularly interested in the one regarding FB Messenger As I highlighted in my prior note <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Whats Next For Messenger I believe that FB Messenger rather than WhatsApp will be FBs key mobile communication platform and that FB will over time encourage WhatsApp users to gradually migrate to FB Messenger to have a single communication platform where FB can incorporate various services such as payment search OO ecommerce and banking Frankly speaking WhatsApp is becoming more like BlackBerry Messenger given its limited functions so it would be capital intensive for FB to simultaneously develop both messaging platforms The introduction of PP payment on FB Messenger rather than WhatsApp is a clear indication that FB is focusing more on FBM rather than WhatsApp as the future of its mobile communication platform The FBM session will be run by Seth Rosenberg Product Manager Lexy Franklin Product Manager and Matt Steiner Engineering Director While no details of their expertise were given in the prerelease we dug into LinkedIn NYSE LNKD to see that Rosenberg was a former banker at Goldman Sachs and an entrepreneur Franklin had prior experience in OO and locationbasedservices with Booyah which developed games that allows users to buy realworld business locations His most recent role prior to FB involved a company that specializes in behavioral change Finally Steiner was a former Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL employee who specialized in storage indexing mail systems web crawling photovideo storage processing and serving systems Additionally he was a tech lead at Google and inventor of autobackup autoorganize autohighlight autoenhance and autoawesome for Google Photos In short the three speakers for the Messenger session all have unique backgrounds and this gives us some clue as to what the session will be about The most probable scenario will be the incorporation of OO and LBS into the app in which a notification or an alert could theoretically alternate the existing behavior of the individual and encourage that individual to either log into FB or conduct a transaction Alternatively photos will be a key feature within the messenger platform where users can easily store organize backup and share photos with their close friends similarly to WeChat moment a timeline of tweets that a user can publish on WeChat In addition search web crawling could also be one of the features for users with the crawler initially searching within FBs massive universe to fulfill the query before resorting to Google I remain bullish on FB Messenger will be a key driver of future engagement for FB as user time spend shifts from PC to mobile and makes mobile apps a more concentrated service ie mobile messenger A broader enhancement of the FBM will be a key catalyst for the stock Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>F Conference Preview All Eyes On Messenger Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
