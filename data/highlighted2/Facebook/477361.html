style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB CEO Mark Zuckerberg knows how to hold a grudge His response to Snapchats Private CHAT billion buyout refusal comes three years later in the form of utter imitation The phrase goes If you cant beat em join em but I suppose Mr Zuckerbergs twist is If you cant buy em copy em Stories is Instagrams newest feature that allows users to post photos and videos that disappear after hours Sound familiar This is exactly what Snapchats Stories feature does too The question that investors must ask themselves is why Instagram chose to integrate this feature into its application On Facebooks Q conference call Mr Zuckerberg announced that Instagram reached more than million monthly active users with more than million active daily Instagrams monthly active user count has increased at a substantial rate see below so what is the issue here Instagram has a problem with its daily active users DAU to monthly active users MAU ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a whopping billion DAUs versus billion who are active monthly The daily number represents of the billion who visit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>monthly With this percentage as a baseline Instagram is underperforming its parent company Instagrams million DAUs represents of the million users who use the application monthly driving the need for innovation to boost engagement Mr Zuckerberg did not blatantly expose Instagrams shortfall on Facebooks conference call but alluded to it Facebooks CEO explained Were working on ways to make the Instagram experience even more engaging Instagram has already changed the way it ranks posts to show users the posts they actually care about The company knows that engagement is higher when people see posts from people or public figures in which they find interest We now know the feature to which Mr Zuckerberg was referring Stories Another article on the matter has been published since I began this writing but the author Alex Pitti believes that Instagram Stories will turn out to be bearish for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>To quickly address his piece I disagree And that is fine After all differing opinions is what makes a market The point of contention is that Instagram Stories is currently viewed in a satirical socially cautious light Keep in mind that a majority of Instagrams userbase is composed of Millennials and teenagers many of whom are afraid to be the first to publicly use new features for fear of social judgement It may sound trite but it is true Currently Instagram Stories is being used by many to recruit others to add them on Snapchat Rather than using Instagrams Stories feature how it should be used people are instead posting their Snapchat usernames Is the above a testament to the stickiness of Snapchat Maybe Does it mean that Snapchat is stealing away Instagram users I do not know The billion company is private and does not release this type of information so why bother theorizing about it What I do know is that the above certainly is not how Mr Zuckerberg envisioned people using Instagram Stories However it is too soon to spell doom for the feature Mr Zuckerberg has a fantastic track record of knowing what users will react to and when to give it to them I do not believe that Instagram Stories will play out differently Speaking anecdotally I have found that people are quick to criticize an applications new feature but shortly after forget their initial reaction and end up enjoying it The first example to pop into my mind is that of Facebooks transition from walls to timelines You may not even remember having a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wall for others to post onto and that is my point So where is the investment thesis in all this Although Instagram has approximately onethird the MAUs of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the app exists solely on mobile With mobile advertising revenue composing of Facebooks total advertising revenue during the second quarter Instagram has and will play an increasingly important role Furthermore I believe that Instagram Stories will help increase DAUs Because the stories are only public for hours users must continually return to the app to view them This is important to investors as many like to see an increasing rate of DAUs as a percentage of MAUs If this metric can become more inline with Facebooks MAU to DAU ratio of then it may warrant a higher multiple for shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Additionally I do not believe that Instagram Stories is a feature that will attract an overwhelming amount of new users It is a feature that is solely meant to boost daily activity and I believe that this is exactly what Mr Zuckerberg was after In the coming quarters Instagrams core goal should be to boost the percentage of MAUs who are also DAUs not just the former By introducing a feature that caters to those who have already downloaded the appliation Instagram can easily boost their MAU figure and please investors Whether you use Snapchat or Instagram or simply invest in the latter via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock Instagram Stories impacts you Looking at the feature from an investing perspective Instagram Stories is a feature that could greatly impact the applications ratio of DAUs to MAUs a key metric followed by investors With many believing that Instagram Stories is initially a flop it is possible that the features impact on activity is not yet factored into Facebooks stock price Therein lies the current opportunity I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
