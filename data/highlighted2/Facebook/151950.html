#A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will keep its live streaming feature Live only for celebrities for now Having exclusivity for the service is Marketing in driving interest and ad revenues Live streaming apps like Twitters Periscope and the independent Meerkat wont be able to market their service as well as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has turned its sights onto the likes of Twitters NYSE TWTR Periscope and the independent Meerkat by offering its own live streaming video The new feature called Live has a twist the service will only be for celebrities streaming to fans Regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users have already asked when they will be able to stream their own videos but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wont give a definite time when that will happen Eventually it will I think at least in the beginning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to stand out Facebooks Live is not simply a me too move In my view its strategic for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I can see how initially limiting live streaming to celebrities and public figures could immediately be coordinated with other promotions like Facebooks new product pages that can be created to cover events and ad campaigns That has the potential to help drive revenues and keep <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock going higher Its Marketing make it exclusive and hard to get and everyone will want it And for diehard fans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would become a favorite place to be for seeing their favorite artists sports players and cult personalities Some of the first who will be able to do live streaming are Dwayne The Rock Johnson Martha Stewart Serena Williams and Michael Bubl As much as Periscope and Meerkat opened up the new field it will be some time before they can harness it to make money Showing videos of average people might spark some interest and curiosity yet it wont be focused enough to drive viewing traffic in a coordinated effort on a large scale at this stage This new feature gives more marketing power to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which in turn could lead to capturing larger ad budget spends from advertisers and businesses Live streaming by celebrities could increase Facebooks average revenue per user ARPU generation and user login time two of the most important metrics that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and its analysts use to judge the companys performance Viewers may stay logged into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>longer to get the latest updates in NewsFeed about their favorite celebrities or even catch a video suddenly streaming from the celebrity User login time is now on average minutes per day according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the earnings call The greater the time logged in the more opportunities for users to see ads engage with businesses and shop online with new features coming out as we speak Average view time means activity so increasing that time increases Facebooks potential earnings capability Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is forecast to grow earnings in the high double digits annually live streaming connected with ad and event promotions can help make that growth rate a reality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trying to convince Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL huge number of businesses and video creators on YouTube to switch over to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Those advertisers will want to split their ad budget among the best advertising platforms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to make sure it gets the majority of that split My take on this is if major brand businesses like cosmetics and haircare producers which heavily use YouTube to showcase their products in short commercials or extended videos were to link up with celebrities who live streamed on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>they would want to advertise on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to harness that star power for their brands According to eMarketer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>grew its net US digital display ad revenues in taking the market leader position with of the nationwide total The market research firm also projects the company will continue to increase its market share over the coming years and widen the gap between it and Google Twitter and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Live streaming will be one more weapon in its arsenal to do that The recent flurry of new features and services from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in particular those connected with video have made me much more bullish on the companys prospects Investors can better understand how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can create its high growth Twitter also is planning to use its Periscope app for multimedia events as a marketing tool However Twitter is having difficulty revamping its product offering to make it more appealing to the mass market while at the same time hunting for a suitably strong new CEO to drive the messaging platform company These distractions will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to leapfrog ahead of Twitter and secure more ad revenue that might potentially go to its rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is carving out its new territory and extending its social media empire For me
