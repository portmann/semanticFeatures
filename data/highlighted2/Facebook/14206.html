and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub FBs valuation has grown to nearly billion but it might still present a good investment opportunity The reason lies in its ARPU and its disconnect from GOOG New services like video and payments could add an extra each to ARPU and FB will continue to gain from ad pricing growth Theres a common thought among many retail value investors that Facebooks NASDAQ FB valuation of nearly billion is leaving very little room for upside and that investors are buying into a value trap While I admit a billion valuation based on todays fundamentals is certainly a stretch investors need to remember one key thing when determining if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a good investment That thing is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is in fact an advertising company and with billion monthly active users MAUs and billion MAUs on mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a great opportunity to grow significantly larger through more effective monetization of those users That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is unveiling and launching new revenuecreating services so fast that it is difficult to keep up But rather than trying to determine how much revenue and profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can earn from each of these new services investors are likely best served by looking solely at average revenue per user ARPU to see how much upside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does in fact have First off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does have the largest network in the world If we account for its network on nonFacebook applications Messenger WhatsApp Instagram then that network is even larger While the ARPU chart courtesy of Digital Strategy Consulting shows how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>compares to Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL as of Q the point is to illustrate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>still has a lot of runway to monetize itself As of Facebooks most recent quarter ARPU in North America had risen to while overall ARPU increased from to yearoveryear Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is seeing significant growth in ARPU and whats impressive is that most of this growth in recent years has come mainly from growing its total advertiser base from one million to two million and more efficiently monetizing mobile In essence these things have taken Facebooks North American ARPU from in Q to in its most recent quarter Looking ahead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will continue to monetize its growing network of advertisers While the average ad pricing growth it saw last year may slow a bit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has given us no reason to believe that ad prices wont continue to increase Yet aside from advertiser count and ad prices whats really exciting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors moving into the next months is both video and payments Specifically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>just recently added a usertouser payment option to its Messenger app a feature that can be used by the apps sub million users Initially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not appear to be charging users to send or receive money a move that many investors have criticized However investors must remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is notorious for getting users to adopt a service on a large scale before monetizing it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>did this with Instagram and also its core site in the early years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was criticized for not monetizing its platform with ads All things being equal investors should just assume that Facebooks goal is to attract widespread use of its payments service and then to begin monetizing with PayPallike services and fees such as currency exchange money services with WhatsApp Theoretically if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>earns annually in future fees per WhatsAppMessenger user through payments itll have a billion business and consequently adding another of ARPU globally That said I expect payments to be much bigger if PayPal can generate billion in revenue during its last quarter on just million users then I find it hard to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cant eventually generate at least a billion dollars quarterly with a combined billion WhatsApp and Messenger users assuming WhatsApp becomes a part of payments As for videos <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has quickly grown into a powerhouse in the online video space with three billion daily views of video content However like so many other new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ventures the company is still in the early stages of monetization While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is sure to monetize this content in many ways one of the more popular methods discussed is by selling second spots to advertisers These spots would give advertisers a hour window where their second video ads would be shown to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users across all platforms Reportedly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is charging up to million a day for these slots but whats unknown is how many slots per day that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is selling What we do know is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has launched video advertising services in eight total markets including the US and Sheryl Sandberg sees it as a key initiative moving forward In theory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could sell a dozen daily ad spots or more but even if it sells just two per day at million each thats an extra billion in revenue Thus theres yet another add to Facebooks global ARPU The point is that because of Facebooks enormous user base the opportunities for monetization are vast Conservative payment and video monetization outlooks could very well add over to Facebooks North American ARPU and double the ARPU in many of its emerging markets Importantly this doesnt even account for the new services that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will unveil in the future or continued MAU and ad price growth While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may never top in ARPU like Google I certainly think is feasible long term nearly triple its North American ARPU and an increase of fold to many other markets Admittedly this is speculative but given the separation that exists between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google I tend to believe it is far more likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will create more efficient methods of monetizing its billion users versus having its ARPU growth come to a sudden halt Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may look expensive now but for a company thats expected to grow annual revenue from billion to billion over the next two years and trades at x trailing month free cash flow I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still a good longterm investment opportunity Source If You Think Facebooks Stock Is A Trap Keep This In Mind Disclosure The author is
