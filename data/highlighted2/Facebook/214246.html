Dells upcoming buyout of EMC Im reflecting on what happened to the Four Horsemen of The Internet If one studies history future mistakes can be avoided This is why one needs to avoid a specific member of the FANG club If you own Amazon get out now before it meets the same fate as Sun Microsystems A brief history lesson will tell you why I recently read an article by Matt Krantz Another Horseman of the Internet loses its head In it Krantz outlines the perils if one had invested in Oracle NYSE ORCL Cisco NASDAQ CSCO EMC NYSE EMC and Sun Microsystems in The reason the article was written is Dell announced its buying EMC for billion marking the second along with Sun Micro of these companies to be bought out Im not sure what Krantzs purpose is In the treatise he states Three of the four Internet horsemen have underperformed the Standard Poors since the beginning of Oracle is the only member of the horsemen that has beaten the SP With that in mind Krantz says earlier Investors can only wonder if the current FANG favorites will meet a similar fate Its generally accepted by most media outlets that FANG is an acronym for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Alphabet aka Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL If one accepts Krantzs premise where one bought these four Internet giants and held them forever ala Warren Buffett then the divergent results Krantz cites were real That assumes of course that someone who never studies fundamentals is involved in this process Below is an earnings chart for Sun Micro based on its reports to the SEC As one can see Sun Micro was pretty much a dog beginning in and stayed that way until it was bought out by Oracle in The question then becomes Would any serious investor try to make money in a company that cant make money for itself The SP as a methodology doesnt seem to think so From the SP s methodology paper we have The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters as reported earnings should be positive as should the most recent quarter That is one of the criteria for index inclusion for a largecap index What does this mean This means using current methodologies Sun Micro should have been dropped when earnings hit negative territory and certainly should have been dropped when it announced negative earnings for the trailing months and the first quarter for the fiscal year in mid November This is the part of what one does not understand about the SP as an index it is not a static blob of stocks that never change According to Standard Poors the average capitalized turnover for the SP is annually That means a full of the index changed since Wouldnt a retail investor do the same during that period The premise that no changes should occur in an investors portfolio is poor investing and needs to stop Even Warren Buffett famous for holding stocks forever sells off holdings when he no longer feels they fit his methodology Recently Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB sold its holdings in Phillips NYSE PSX and National Oilwell Varco NYSE NOV so even the most loyal investor is willing to sell holdings when necessary Its November and Sun Micro has just announced its most recent earnings and for the second consecutive quarter it has been a losing three months On top of that Sun Micro has been losing money for the past year Our astute investor looks at their portfolio and sees the following adjusted returns since the beginning of At this point it appears that while our investor has been losing money and they would have fared better in the overall technology index there is no significant difference from the SP So lets assume that our reasonably astute investor decided to sell the dog Sun Micro on November and invest the proceeds in the remaining holdings that they still had This is how they would have done since November as of October All returns assume reinvested dividends As one can see the returns are fairly comparable if one like the SP is willing to make changes based on negative earnings Even Krantz in acknowledged that things did not look good for Sun Micro so why not make changes The fact that Oracle is the only stock that outperformed the market becomes irrelevant As a whole the portfolio did earn a decent return compared to the various market indices and that is all that matters Im willing to admit this analysis even provides an argument for investing in index funds or ETFs and calling it a day Todays fourpack of Internet giants also known as FANG are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Amazon Netflix and Alphabet As recently as October these companies are discussed together as potential candidates for a different buy and hold strategy These are the earnings per share for the most recent quarters for each corporation Clearly if one wants to use the anecdotal lesson of the past one should avoid Amazon like a virus It certainly should not pass muster for initial consideration The reasons are Its difficult to even place a valuation on Amazon Given that its recent month earnings per share are a loss of there is no fair way to evaluate a future price for the company Even if one wanted to use the pricetosales ratio as a multiplier Amazon with its growth rate might be worth a projected which is just under its current price tag That assumes though that a PS ratio of is warranted which is higher than the market average of If one wants to be more conservative and use the SP s average then a fair price is more like Amazon has not had consecutive fiscal years with positive earnings since Think about that for a minute It has been four years since Jeff Bezos company has posted positive earnings in backtoback fiscal years Heck it cant even post positive earnings for consecutive quarters Compare this to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Netflix and Alphabet where earnings have remained positive for every available fiscal year in the last years with FB and GOOGL showing the stronger earnings persistence So far the growth rates for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>year Netflix year and Alphabet year are positive Because the remaining companies have at least posted positive earnings growth its possible to calculate a future value for each company albeit that is not the focus here The current trend is that Amazons earnings are getting worse not better That alone should tell one to simply avoid this company as a potential dumpster fire Suze Orman was right if a company cannot make money for itself how is it going to make money for you Should you trust Amazon to make you money The answer is no History tells us to avoid headless horsemen and
