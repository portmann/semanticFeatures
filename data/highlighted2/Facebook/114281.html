recently changed its advertising model which will definitely attract direct response companies Accordingly I see a bigger uptake from advertisers as success can be easily tracked Internet advertising in the US is predicted to increase to over billion by Mobile also is predicted to take off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be at the forefront <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is investing heavily at the moment and profitability may take a hit in the short term Nevertheless long term all investments should increase revenue and earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc NASDAQ FB is already up year to date compared with NYSEARCA SPY being practically flat for the year thus far and is surprising many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bears with its underlying strength Can this impressive growth continue Who knows but one thing is certain This company is operating in a huge growth area internet advertising so it stands to reason that more people coming online should definitely improve the companys bottom line going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bears claim that the stock is too overvalued at present I recently wrote an article here and mentioned that this stock was trading at times net income which on the surface looks extremely high However this company definitely has things in its favor and could easily surpass a share here Lets discuss First I believe the company made a smart move recently when it changed its advertising model I agree with this recent article that this is a big deal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>going forward Up to now many marketers had a presence on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but the effectiveness of this presence was very hard to measure because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>charged for likes shares and comments on its platform Well thats all history now as the social media company now only intends to charge customers for clicks on links that direct to external websites and apps This is similar to the method that Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL adopts the cost per click method This means that advertisers will be rewarded with cheaper click costs if their ads are highly targeted which in turn will have high click through rates The thing now though is that advertisers will easily be able to see if they are getting a return on their advertising dollars The cost of each clink is predicted to go up in price as now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wont be charging for the internal clicks likes shares etc Nevertheless heres the skinny Many advertisers have it already worked out what they can pay for a lead A lead generally is a prospect interested in the advertiser products and has provided his contact details If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can provide cost effective leads to advertisers which now can be calculated to the cent the sky is the limit for this platform When you couple the above point with the following chart you begin to feel less bearish about this stock even considering its relatively high valuation The chart above shows that billion is expected to be spent on online advertising in In total billion of this compared to billion expected this year is expected to be spent on display advertising of which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the dominant company in the US However it gets even better when you look at mobile ad revenue projections see below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is expected to increase its mobile revenues next year by over billion which again should increase earnings substantially However increasing revenues also are going to come with increasing costs Facebooks headcount has ballooned to more than and the company continues to invest relentlessly into its platforms to try and keep eyeballs stationed there for longer Investment also has been ploughed into its advertising programs as it tries to attract new advertisers to its platforms Other huge investments include virtual reality and Internetorg where the latters goal is to get more people online in developing countries Furthermore huge money is being spent on servers and data centers which again should increase Facebooks active users going forward Thats the end goal here more users The advantage a social media platform has over a search engine for example is that once a user starts using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>connecting with family and friends etc its improbable that this user will leave This company is definitely setting itself up nicely The revenue growth will be there and over time the cost of this revenue should decline Do I see risks Yes New privacy regulations may hinder user growth Also the US economy where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>derives the vast majority of its income may enter a new recession Nevertheless this company is at the forefront of the information age and should do well going forward Yes it may be trading at almost times net income but its still a very risky short at this moment in time Source Its Wrong To Be Too Bearish On <span
