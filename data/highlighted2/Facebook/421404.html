class='textDiv'>Short Alibaba Now Alibaba Group Holding Limited NYSEBABA Seeking Alpha Its possible that enough headwinds have developed that shorting Alibaba or buying puts over the next few quarters is a reasonable trade The SEC investigation has an uncertain timeline and outcome creating fear for current shareholders Although Alibaba is showing strength in full cooperation There are several clear reasons why shorting Alibaba NYSE BABA is a viable trade in the current market There is a SEC investigation underway that is searching for signs of fraud within the companys financial statements China continues to slow and economic reports missing expectations could fuel a downtrend in the Shanghai Composite and subsequently Alibaba Additionally the fact that Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO remains a principal stakeholder as a target company after SoftBank OTCPKSFTBY sold off shares has me concerned about a potential snowball effect occurring SEC investigations can be death sentences for growing companies The investigation into Alibabas financials is only at its beginning but so far the results have been largely benign The SEC will be looking for either evidence of fraud or the intent to defraud If either of these come up throughout the course of the investigation expect massive losses for BABA Shareholder confidence in this equity would be highly diminished however trying to calculate the probability of the outcome of this investigation is a fools game In this kind of a situation its best to be conservative with the uncertainty and not be bullish on the outcome To be fair Alibaba is not required to cooperate with the SEC because this investigation is so early on and no subpoenas have been issued nor has that been deemed even necessary However a lack of cooperation moving forward would signal strength to the shorts Fortunately Alibaba is voluntarily cooperating as of right now as established in its recent F The timeline to a final decision from this investigation is uncertain and could take several years That means one of two things either investors start avoiding the stock because of this looming headwind or they ignore the background headwind and focus on the companys key growth drivers Its possible that right now BABA is hampered by this investigation from breaking out and acting more like a positive tech stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB or Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Perhaps this is why the stock is stagnating a few dollars above its DMA seen below A true contrarian may suggest that based upon todays dip in BABA of fueled by the SEC investigation and a sale of shares from a major shareholder that buying in now for the long term is a solid investment decision BABA has had a lot of difficulty in breaching the resistance level and now that the riskreward scenario has been marginally improved this is an ideal time to enter However there are still other headwinds in place Are investors so quick to forget that China is slowing considerably This is the very factor that caused such a strong dip in the Shanghai Composite back in January and subsequently Alibaba If the target GDP rate has to be revised in the coming quarters then Chinese markets and consequently American markets are going to experience significant downside It was just reported that NonManufacturing PMI hit a threemonth low This is concerning considering stimulus measures are being directed towards housing and infrastructure projects not startups or tech development So despite the positivity surrounding the word stimulus Alibaba doesnt stand to be a direct beneficiary As is Hong Kong is feeling the weakness from China as its GDP shrank in Q for the first time since seen below Nearby economies of Taipei and Macau as well as Mongolia continue to exhibit weakness A revisiting of the January lows experienced by BABA will likely be on the back of poor growth from China A flight to quality will occur if a major market event causes a broader market downturn In that case a clear of the float from Yahoo and of the float from SoftBank is at risk of being sold off in pieces as these investors will want more cash assets The catalyst to a downturn Profit taking like what SoftBank just did more reports indicating China is slowing as just discussed or potential selling of shares from Yahoo another principal shareholder of Alibaba Now that SoftBank has announced that it is selling billion worth of shares their effective ownership stake reigns in at Increasing complications with Yahoo arise in that its stake amounts to billion Depending on what ends up happening with that company Alibabas shareholders could really witness a strong exhibit This is a very real risk that could countertrend any positive growth initiatives taken by Alibaba over the next couple of months Like the SEC investigation the timeline to resolution on Yahoos situation is unknown Bids are already coming in below expectations even with a variety of suitors making this stake all the more important An important piece of information to consider when thinking about Yahoos potential sell off of shares over the next few months is that ownership is the minimum amount in order for a stakeholder to retain a board seat If Yahoo sells just over of the total float itll lose its board seat This could very well be something that an acquiring company may try to prevent Yahoo from doing given the long list of growth catalysts that Alibaba has Retaining such a stake is pivotal towards longterm earnings generation for any acquirer With all of this negativity I am still long Alibaba While my shares have seen decent appreciation since the level which was below the IPO level of there are still a multitude of medium and longterm growth catalysts that make this equity seem undervalued For example Alibabas future US expansion cloud capabilities Ant Financials future IPO and improving expectations all point to a bright future That being said the risks outlined in this article are clear and hedging my long position at the present time isnt a bad idea Im staying cautious with BABA for now I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock
