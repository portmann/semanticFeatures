base transitions to mobile Desktop gaming is an indicator that payments revenue will continue to stagnate in the short run Zynas revenue from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has declined from in Q to in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can move to a transaction fee model with mobile payments in its messaging app When we last looked at Facebooks NASDAQ FB payments business we predicted that revenue would plateau as more of its user base transitioned to mobile usage We made this deduction by observing the trend in payments revenue and ARPU in Asia and rest of world regions where platform usage is mobilefirst or mobileonly We can now conclude that payments revenue has plateaued as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues its structural shift to mobile Further by using games revenue as an indicator we can deduce that payments revenue will remain flat or decline in the short run Payments revenue in Q was million a decline of over the yearago quarter According to the company the yearoveryear decrease in payments revenue resulted from a decline in revenue including inapp transaction revenue from games played on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on desktop computers Games revenue makes up materially all of Facebooks payments revenue so it serves as a strong proxy for the viability of the payments business The downward trend in games revenue has been acknowledged by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in successive earnings calls since Q and it is reflected in flat revenue for payments The stagnation of payments revenue is not necessarily the result of reduced interest in games on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Rather it is the result of the shift to mobile consumption by Facebooks users Mobile MAUs in the first quarter of increased quarteroverquarter to B users Mobileonly usage ie those users that hire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>exclusively on mobile devices increased over the yearago quarter to M <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not provide data on desktop usage but the company noted that revenue from advertisements served on desktop was down from a year ago We can better understand the decline in desktop usage and the consequent stagnation of payments revenue by using Zyngas NASDAQ ZNGA revenue as a proxy Zyngas inapp transaction revenue has historically comprised the bulk of payments revenue on Facebooks desktop platform On mobile that revenue is generally apportioned to the iOS and Android app stores where inapp transactions are processed at the operating system level As mobile supplants the desktop the segment of Zyngas revenue from inapp transactions on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has declined from a of total revenue in Q to only in Q The decline reflects the consequence of mobile adoption among users on both platforms We can observe the effects of this downward trend through the lens of Facebooks average revenue per user ARPU for payments Payments ARPU is flat or down sequentially and yearoveryear in all regions For example Europe region saw a decline in payments over the yearago quarter Aside from a onetime accounting recognition in Q ARPU has remained unchanged or in decline in spite of significant sequential user base growth in Facebooks developing regions This is unsurprising because most of Facebooks developing region growth is exclusive to the mobile platform where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not accrue payments revenue Despite the stagnation of the payments business pundits continue to opine about Facebooks eventual participation in mobile payments The pervasiveness of smart devices and the promise of mobile commerce supported by big data is an enticing narrative Facebooks acquisitions in Instagram and WhatsApp continue to enjoy strong adoption The latter entrenches Facebooks position in a number of emerging markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has enjoyed comparable growth in its own messaging application which it treats as a separate platform Together these platforms offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a robust foundation from which to enter mobile payments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has made some attempt to participate in mobile payments The company recently launched a money transfer protocol in its messaging application The new feature allows US users to transfer dollars from linked debit cards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not currently take a transaction fee Profitability in mobile transactions is achieved only at scale If the feature is widely adopted by users then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can transition to a feebased transaction model The company has stoked speculation to this effect by hiring David Marcus from PayPal to work on its messaging platform It is likely that Facebooks messaging application will reach a sufficient scale to allow it to move a transaction fee model The question is whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is actually interested in building the secondary revenue stream The quarteroverquarter stagnation of its payments business might suggest that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is contented with its advertising revenue However the company has recently shown interest in mobile commerce by it businesstocustomer connection efforts in Messenger Furthermore the WhatsApp subscription model also promises to increase payments revenue particularly in emerging markets The standalone platform generated M in the six months ending Q Despite the low hanging fruit of a mobile payments business the company is guiding down revenue from payments for at least the remainder of the fiscal year As Facebooks mobile user base continues to grow the company focuses its attention on mobile advertising Even at scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>remains at a comparative disadvantage to mobile operating systems at inapp transaction processing The applications being delivered to users via Facebooks app install ads tend to rely on the operating systems more robust payments infrastructure Facebooks position in the application layer of the software stack hampers its competitiveness Therefore in the short run we should expect advertising to continue to comprise the bulk of Facebooks revenue and payments revenue to remain unchanged or in decline Source Prospects For Facebooks Payments Business Disclosure I amwe are long FB MoreI wrote this article
