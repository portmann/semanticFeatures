this subtle change is important is that it could be used eventually to drive oneclick optin allowance enrollment in recurring content As first reported by T echcrunch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is altering the way that advertisers collect information from users This update is one of the rare occasions where the change actually benefits both engaged parties something that will make the thirdparty involved <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>very happy So the change is subtle and most users who find themselves interested in an advertisement or if theyve never clicked an ad most likely wont notice the difference this is an intended outcome of the change but the change is meaningful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now will prefill user information it has collected for its platform name address email phone number etc if the user selects this option into an adcall to actionlanding page box for the user Why does this matter Two share price driving reasons that I can call out in the early going The first is the obvious one in that in the immediate term this will remove friction from users actually completing the process of giving information to an advertiser Thats big for obvious reasons as well Lower abandon rates increased efficacy rates better key metrics for both the advertiser and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>better data collection for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stuff like what types of ads are you and I most attracted to etc I mean everything that you would expect These are all things by the way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>again can sell to followon advertising partners and marketers for a premium What youre seeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>do inch by inch is widen the top of the sales funnel and streamline everything below the opening lip As for the second reason this is big coincidentally a conversation I had this morning happens to frame it quite nicely I was chatting with Playbasis a gamification specialist tech company founder and CEO Rob Zepeda this morning and he was adamant in his belief that The smart companies are going to be investing heavily in improving outcomes the bottom of the funnel Its more important than the top of the funnel The leverage is in improving conversion and increasing consumption I couldnt agree more with that assessment and I think very obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>understands this I believe the second share price driving reason this subtle change is important is that it could be used eventually to drive oneclick optin allowance enrollment in recurring content Ill explain So Ive opined many a time recently and tried to keep readers abreast of changes either productive or detractive to my thesis that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is optimizing its core platform for content marketing specifically the Inbound variety If Im right this easy optin that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is testing and priming its user base for could and should be deployed to Instant Articles as well as other content containing Author Tags If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can show traction early with this first initiative and subsequently show traction in launching this to broader content it would have serious ground to stand on in asking content generators to pay a huge premium for it helping build a following base I believe both Facebooks Instant Articles and Author Tags are parallel value prop drivers that will be platforms to drive value from its auto optin initiative <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>being a proactive contributor to a paying advertiser or marketer userlead base would be a unique verifiable asset it could sell similar to the valueprop that Inbound Marketing companies HubSpot NYSE HUBS and Marketo NASDAQ MKTO sell to their customers A value prop that collectively in the infancy of the industry has already created billion in market cap this is without having a source platform to pluck leads from or any real infrastructure housing for a lead base Thats just two companies in the much wider much deeper niche Again I continue to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>sees the forest through the trees when it comes to the tectonic shift in marketing and advertising as do the companies mentioned above and that its taking the adequate steps to insure that its a major player when the movement settles I continue to recommend FB as a core position FB common is up since I initiated a long position with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Jan CALLs up since initiation five trading days ago Source <span
