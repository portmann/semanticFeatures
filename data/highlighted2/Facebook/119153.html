(Facebook: Uncertainty) </span>Regular readers know my strong preference for the EV/EBITDA valuation matrix for valuing technology companies.A more detailed explanation of the valuation methodology is explained in my initiation report on JD.com .Based on their last closing price on 14th July 2015, their EV/EBITDA valuation methodology that compares FB with Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), FB is trading at a discount to the industry average, or more aptly, to LinkedIn (since Twitter is EBITDA negative).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At 34.74 x , this represents a 66.4 % , almost two-thirds discount to what investors are willing to pay for LinkedIn , even though <b>Facebook</b> is profitable vs. both Twitter and LinkedIn , which makes the current valuations investors will pay for <b>Facebook</b> extremely undemanding . (Facebook: Uncertainty) </span>I think there remains a long path to monetization for both Whatsapp and Instagram.But there is strong commitment from the management to catch up with their peers and expand their user base.Furthermore, as at the last closing price on the 14th of July 2015, FB is trading at an extremely steep discount to LinkedIn which is unjustified.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : <b>Facebook</b> : New Ventures Set To Take Off Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but may initiate a long position in FB over the next 72 hours .
