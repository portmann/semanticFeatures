Whatsapps monthly average users since acquisition nearly doubling from million users to million users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>remains patient in monetizing from the app Promising venture into ecoomerce partnership with Shopify Strong engagement data based on their share of mobile minutes excluding tablets At a twothirds discount to peers based on the EVEBITDA TTM valuation methodology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is trading at a steep discount to peers Given strong advertising revenue and track record the discount is unjustified in my view Consistent with their message since acquiring Whatsapp last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is unlikely to be in a rush to monetize their acquisition of Whatsapp I think their first priority is to grow the number of users of the app and grow rapidly they did Since their acquisition by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>last year the MAU has nearly doubled from million users to million users See graph below My estimation for the end of the second quarter puts the figure at between to million users which is double since the acquisition last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has remained coy when quizzed about their monetization strategy for Whatsapp and Instagram I think their strategy is to rapidly increase the number of users to the app creating network externality effect in terms of the number of users they have While some in the street have speculated that the monetization strategy will involve having advertisements in the app I think this is highly unlikely as it will depart from the original foundersinitial mission of having no ads in the app Rather I think they are likely to reinstate the per user fee which could be once off or charged yearly Their strategy is increasing the number of users then reduce the impact of churn once they reinstate the costs Much debate has centered on when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is intending to reinstate the costs and I think the runway is still long when it comes to monetizing the app Recent developments however are encouraging that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is getting closer to monetizing the app Whatsapp is now accessible in the desktop and the messages sent and received are fully synced with the mobile device and desktop version This is similar to the imessage system used on Apple devices Whatsapp users also can now make voice calls on the app I think this is another potential avenue to earn fees similar to Line where users are charged based on calls made overseas which is still preferable since it is lower vs those charged by telcos Overall I think it is positive that there is more color on plans on monetizing Whatsapp but remain cautious about their ability to charge fees on users I think Whatsapp is a little behind the curve compared to their peers Line and Viber and are trying to play catchup Promising venture into ecommerce with Shopify The expansion of testing of native advertisement buy buttons on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is built on a backend of Shopifys ecommerce technology I believe the venture into ecommerce with Shopify fits their overall strategy of increasing ad revenues Users of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>who click on the button to purchase items will increase the conversion rate resulting in improvements in ROI and advertisers will be more inclined to increase the number of ads at a possibly higher price With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>gaining ground with stronger share of mobile minutes this share of mobile minutes exclude those from tablets and only calculates those from smartphones and desktops According to data from comscore Facebooks share was about last year July and it has since risen to in May Regular readers know my strong preference for the EVEBITDA valuation matrix for valuing technology companies A more detailed explanation of the valuation methodology is explained in my initiation report on JDcom Based on their last closing price on th July their EVEBITDA valuation methodology that compares FB with Twitter NYSE TWTR and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD FB is trading at a discount to the industry average or more aptly to LinkedIn since Twitter is EBITDA negative At x this represents a almost twothirds discount to what investors are willing to pay for LinkedIn even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is profitable vs both Twitter and LinkedIn which makes the current valuations investors will pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>extremely undemanding I think there remains a long path to monetization for both Whatsapp and Instagram But there is strong commitment from the management to catch up with their peers and expand their user base Furthermore as at the last closing price on the th of July FB is trading at an extremely steep discount to LinkedIn which is unjustified Source <span style='background-color:
