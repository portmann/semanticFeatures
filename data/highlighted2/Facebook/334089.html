</span>Shares traded for times its trailing earnings per share and more than times sales per share Looks like has been a phenomenal year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Fabulous Q earnings of cents per share on billion in revenue surpassed even the highest estimates on Wall Street of cents per share and revenue of billion Annual revenue from advertising jumped yoy and free cash flow increased yoy On the day Q earnings were reported Facebooks shares surged in premarket trading and now even a month later investors are still rushing to become part of this rapidly growing social media giant Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are being traded for times its trailing earnings per share and more than times sales per share Kevin Landis CEO at Firsthand Capital Management described it as Its doom and gloom all around us and these guys are just killing it On the face of it all sounds nice and rosy but a few things caught my attention Annual revenue from advertising shot up despite a decrease in number of ads delivered Data from reveals the same pattern revenue from advertising increased by although the number of ads delivered decreased by The skyrocketing prices of ads and in and respectively may partly explain the sharply falling number of ads delivered But when adding both variables together sharply increasing prices and falling number of ads delivered it is rather surprising to find on the right hand of the equation such a strong increase in revenue from ads Fantastic growth rate figures of Daily Active Users DAU In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>managed to achieve a milestone of billion daily active users worldwide This figure means that DAU grew in by Admittedly this is an amazing annual growth rate but please allow me to express my doubts regarding this figure In the third quarter of then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>CFO David Ebersman admitted that the company was seeing a decline in the amount teenagers using the social network Back then the rate for teens abandoning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was estimated to be a million per year A demographic report from made by iStrategyLabs went further than that and even suggested that million young people left <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>between the years That report suggests that the average rate of youngsters leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is more than million per year in the US alone A UK study on Social Media among youngsters conducted by UCL Professor Daniel Miller concluded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is basically dead and buried Mostly they feel embarrassed even to be associated with it One can debate whether trends in the US and UK among youngsters leak into the rest of the world straight away or with a time lag but it is a popular trend and therefore worth keeping it at the back of ones mind Concerns have been expressed at a recent GlobalWebIndex survey which claimed that in Q only of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users updated their status and only shared their own photos a decline from and in the previous year Until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>defined Daily Active Users as follows We define a daily active user as a registered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user who logged in and visited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>through our website or a mobile device used our Messenger app or took an action to share content or activity with his or her <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>friends or connections via a thirdparty website or application that is integrated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on a given day It practically means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>counted people as daily active users when logged into thirdparty apps and websites that are integrated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and those people who just clicked like on a website page or article but never actually visited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>These elements alone are enough to massively inflate numbers of Daily Active Users In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>amended the definition of DAU to include only users who logged into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or its messenger app at least once a day Logic dictates that the immediate consequence should have been a sharp drop in DAU Instead we see a sharp rise of This does not ring true Facebooks current rapid growth stands out But it is growth normally only seen in the early years of startups <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is no longer the young brash startup company it was It is more than a decade old large and wellestablished corporate giant As such it should be growing at a much slower pace than it does currently The Beneish Mscore is a model designed to detect earnings manipulations The variables of the model are constructed from the companys financial statements The score they deliver describes the degree to which earnings have been manipulated MScore of greater than signals that the company is likely an accounting manipulator When running the model on Facebooks financials the resulted Mscore signals that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is likely to have manipulated its earnings between Q and Q All the points mentioned above may be part of Facebooks attempt to deal in a creative manner with ongoing troubles and woes such as intense pressure to prove that its monetization plan for Instagram and Whatsapp is working well its decreasing popularity the expected stagnation of active users growth rates the growing number of software and mobile apps designed to block ads the rising scope of fake online activity on Facebooks platform and the threatening loss of marketers Whether those creative tricks will still deliver fabulous results in the future is uncertain Currently the only thing that remains certain is the old adage if it sounds too good to be true it probably is Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
