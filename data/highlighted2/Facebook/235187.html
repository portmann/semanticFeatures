arent that convincing and the degree to which it will affect solvency metrics isnt enough to raise the question of insolvency While theres no denying Netflix has burned some cash this year investors have already priced in that impact as management guided to worsening FCF a couple quarters ago Furthermore the degree to which liabilities are added to the balance sheet matches the companys business model as they need to increase their content offering every year The risk is isolated to whether NFLX can ramp revenue to meet its obligations Given the revenue drivers and the expanding TAM a drop off in sales seems highly unlikely Investors have bemoaned Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX balance sheet metrics for as long as I can remember The accounting related to the income statement is borderline unconventional and extremely difficult to comprehend even for analysts who have a high order understanding of accounting In other words investors should be cautious on balance sheet metrics but the degree to which you can create a compelling short case is borderline ridiculous Now for obvious reasons investors in Netflix have been able to capitalize on its growth While various members of the investment community have labeled it a speculative name to own I feel fairly confident in my stance on the stock And thats even after analyzing the various balance sheet metrics other analysts have torn apart In other words theres a high wall of worry to climb if youre going to buy some of the higherflying tech names as theyre primarily valued on the basis of improving salesearnings metrics Whether that optimism in sales is even warranted is another topic for another day In a recent Seeking Alpha article published by Ben Keith he raises issues with content liabilities In its Q for the period ended it discloses BN in its current content library and BN in current content liabilities Under note Commitments and Contingencies it discloses a total of BN in aggregate shortterm streaming commitments or BN in additional offbalance sheet liabilities Management teams facing increasing costs may do this to reduce COGS thereby increasing margins beyond what is actually feasible The result is an unsustainable and bloated inventory as cost that should have been accounted for in the income statement gets left behind in inventory I have included the breakdown in content obligations for your reference so we can verify Keiths arguments But lets first start by understanding why Netflix frontloads its content liabilities On numerous conference calls the CFO mentions that there is variation when pertaining to the amortization schedule of content But basically content viewing hours determine the amortization rate for content and if you have a successful hit the number of viewing hours is frontloaded and you amortize more quickly If the content isnt successful in initial viewing hours but viewing is more spread out the amortization schedule stretches and changes to match the viewership the show or movie gets In other words determining the rate at which amortization occurs is hazy at best because we dont get a whole lot of granular data on that However the important thing to notice are content obligations for December I discovered this a year ago but basically the amount of content due in one year roughly corresponds to the cost of revenue for that fiscal year So Netflix included the offbalance sheet obligations due and the current due amounts in their notes and as you roll through the year the liabilities increase as costs get layered on top of each other as the year progresses But if you look at cost of revenue the amount is billion which roughly corresponds to the less than oneyear content obligation figure of billion In other words Netflixs cost of revenue for FY seems pretty predictable but whether or not sales ramp to meet that content obligation is a risk Why does the cash conversion cycle not take this into consideration Well lets observe how the metric is actually calculated Cash conversion cycle days inventory outstanding days sales outstanding days payable outstanding The problem with the cash conversion cycle and this only applies to Netflix is that it uses the receivable amount for calculating the difference in the number of days it takes to receive cash as opposed to paying off liabilities However as many of you Netflix watchers know revenues are backyear loaded which means that the liabilities or cost of revenue are high going into the frontend of the year when revenues are at the lowest but become balanced out by the growth in subscriptions towards the back half of a given fiscal year Assuming they ramp up revenue they can pay off their content obligations as they become due and solvency becomes less of an issue Growth has been fairly consistent However and more importantly the sequential growth is notably high in the holiday quarter Netflix projects sequential growth and generally speaking they have a solid track record of meeting their own outlook The current consensus estimate for FY is billion in revenue and the shortterm streaming obligation for FY is billion However its content obligations tend to increase every quarter which means that in Q we have in obligations due in under a year but if it increases by an additional like it did last year we can ballpark cost of revenue at billion which means gross margins for FY will be this year which compares to gross margins of in FY In other words theres no denying that theres some degradation of operating metrics that seems unavoidable given the rate they add shortterm obligations and the rate at which they get expensed at Revenue wont offset costs as much this year and the cash balance will decline modestly However the way Keith present his argument creates the assumption that Netflix has major solvency issues which is completely ridiculous I guess the most accurate way to observe this is by simply looking at the cash burn rate or the amount of cash they have left over in any given quarter Just looking at the cash and shortterm investments theres no denying that Netflixs cash position has declined But the degree to which it will decline isnt so substantial that you begin to wonder if theyll have enough money to pay their bills on time this year The current ratio is which means they have more than enough to cover current obligations and will have nearly twice the amount left over I rely on this metric because its a fairly accurate indicator of solvency as opposed to the other metrics Ben Keith mentions in his article Also the liabilities increase ahead of revenues because Netflix likes to increase the size of its content offering every single year Therefore you have to sign agreements to pay for content years in advance because the production phase takes so long and many movie makers arent willing to enter into production unless if they know theyll receive a dedicated amount to pay off all of their costs years down the road Therefore the current liabilities metrics look awkward at best because inventory when based on retail metrics is supposed to sit on the balance sheet for a very short duration in time The more inventory gets circulated in a year the more efficient you are with cash However in the case of Netflix its inventory is content licenses and that inventory is depreciated on a usage basis as opposed to straightline Therefore you have variances in the amortization schedule which results in some lumpiness in FCF However not only do you have lumpiness but the days it takes to turn over current content obligations as measured by the turnover ratio tends to be long in comparison to retail companies The turnover ratio was days in when based on current liabilities and cost of revenue amounts at the end of FY Content is supposed to last for a long amount of time and isnt meant to be turned over frequently as its not a retail sales model Therefore using those metrics on a retail business like WalMart as opposed to Netflix is reasonable Also Netflix has more flexibility with its cost levers than what other analysts may imply Netflix has moved over more of its content purchases to inhouse productions Meaning they can reduce the size of its costs in response to revenues if need be They dont necessarily have to spend as much in any given year as theyre in a position to at least mitigate productions costs in any year This may not sit well with shareholders if they have to reduce the size of their production slate but at the same time we at least know they can navigate their cost structure as liabilities only become liabilities when content is made available onto the movie streaming platform That means that at least some of these liabilities can be reduced before they ever make it to the movie streaming platform if in the event Netflixs internal expectation on sales isnt met in FY Therefore Im not nearly as concerned with balance sheet metrics as Netflix bears are It was noted two or three quarters ago that free cash flow was going to dip into the negative for a while which explains why their cash balance has declined They still have enough reserve cash to last them for quite a while The downward revisions to FCF have been made ages ago by the investment community and quite frankly the loss of cash has already been priced in Therefore the investment case for selling short Netflix based on observable trends in cash flow metrics cannot be made because its a pricing event that has already occurred The worst case scenario for Netflix shareholders is a massive reduction in sales expectations following the announcement of QFY earnings If Netflix is unable to grow sales by in FY as indicated by analyst estimates then you have a serious problem with the investment thesis as growth is suppose to accelerate between FY and FY Thats because they have increased the addressable market and international streaming is expected to grow off of a sizable revenue base If those growth assumptions arent met you then have to expect Netflix to burn through more cash over the short run and theyre going to shed some costs in their own inhouse movie productions because theyre still tied to licensing commitments with outside studios The inhouse productions provide more value and are more flexible in terms of cost management Therefore if you have to cut a couple episodes out of the next season of House of Cards or reduce the number of inhouse offerings the platform wide effects could be broadly interpreted as a negative to subscriber retention But after having assessed the various drivers to revenue growth I weight this as an extremely low probability In other words investors that are short Netflix might as well be standing in front of a bullet train If the shorts were destroyed in with less convincing balance sheet fundamentals what do you think will happen if you have more cash sitting on the balance sheet following a bond offering and growth accelerates Well youre bound to lose a lot of money if you do short especially in an environment where investors have gotten aggressive with momentum names like
