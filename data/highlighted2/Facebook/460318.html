Goods SAN FRANCISCOWASHINGTON July Twitter Inc moved swiftly to remove posts from Islamic extremists glorifying a truck attack in Nice France watchdog groups said Friday in a rare round of praise for a platform that has often struggled to contain violent propaganda A spate of violence over the past several months has posed numerous challenges to social media companies The unfolding military coup in Turkey was marked first by restrictions on social media internet monitoring groups said but the crackdown appeared to ease as the events unfolded and numerous citizens broadcast live video on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and sent tweets US and French authorities on Friday were still trying to determine whether the Tunisian man who drove a truck into Bastille Day crowds on Thursday killing people had ties to Islamic militants At least Twitter accounts praising the attacks used the hashtag Nice in Arabic according to the Counter Extremism Project a private group that monitors and reports extremist content online Many accounts appeared almost immediately after the attack and shared images praising the carnage the group said The pattern was similar to what was seen on Twitter after attacks last year and earlier this year in Paris and Brussels But Twitter which once took a purist approach to free speech but has since revised its rules took action much more quickly this week Twitter moved with swiftness we have not seen before to erase proattack tweets within minutes Counter Extremism Project said in a statement It was the first time Twitter has reacted so efficiently Rabbi Abraham Cooper head of the Simon Wiesenthal Centers Digital Terrorism and Hate project also said Twitter had responded with unusual alacrity Twitter did not provide any information about account suspensions but said in a statement that it condemns terrorism and bans it on its site Twitter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc and other internet firms have ramped up their efforts over the past two years to quickly remove violent propaganda that violates their terms of service Both companies continue to face major challenges in distinguishing between graphic images that are shared to glorify or celebrate attacks and those shared by witnesses who are documenting events Facebooks community standards dictate what types of content are and are not allowed on the platform Those standards explicitly ban terrorism and related content such as posts or images that celebrate attacks or promote violence Yet the companys policies around graphic images are more nuanced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like most large internet companies relies on users and eagleeyed advocacy groups to report objectionable content to teams of human editors who then review each submission and decide whether a post should be deleted At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>those reviewers receive more specific guidance beyond the public community standards when it comes to deciding what to do with reported graphic images a spokeswoman said But she declined to elaborate on the companys criteria One of the most sensitive situations involves people sharing violent or graphic images of events taking place in the real world In those situations context and degree are everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said in a blog post last week Internet companies have continually updated their terms of service over the past two years to establish clearer and in many cases stricter ground rules on what content is permissible on their platforms In response to pressure by US lawmakers and counterextremism groups <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and YouTube have moved recently toward implementing some automated processes to block or rapidly remove Islamic State videos and similar material reutrsUVp That has not stopped Islamist militants from celebrating attacks online and even updating their tactics Some Islamic State supporters used Twitter hashtags that were trending globally to celebrate the Nice attacks such as PrayForNice NiceAttack and Nice so that their tweets were shown to a wider audience according to screenshots from the Wiesenthal Center Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb in San Francisco and Dustin Volz
