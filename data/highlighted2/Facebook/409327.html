dozen US conservative leaders on Wednesday and said he will work to build trust with users who believe the social network displays politically biased news content After a closeddoor meeting at the companys Silicon Valley headquarters Zuckerberg defended his companys practices but acknowledged that many conservatives believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is politically liberal It doesnt make sense for our mission or our business to suppress political content Zuckerberg wrote on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>after the meeting I know many conservatives dont trust that our platform surfaces content without a political bias he added I wanted to hear their concerns personally and have an open conversation about how we can build trust The editorial practices at the worlds largest social network came under scrutiny after a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>contractor anonymously accused editors there of deliberately suppressing conservative news The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo which did not identify the excontractor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook

discussion and some attendees called it productive I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is very sincere in wanting to resolve outstanding issues with conservatives Brent Bozell president of the Media Research Center said after the meeting Attendees were frank about their concerns but the tone was cordial Bozell said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook

not supported a presidential candidate this cycle Although a US Senate committee is investigating whether there is liberal bias in selection of trending topics there is little chance the government will try to regulate Facebooks practices said Republican Senator John Thune chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee I dont have any reason to believe that would be necessary Thune told reporters on Tuesday Thune sent a letter to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>last week to demand that it explain its editorial decisionmaking and how stories are chosen for the trending
