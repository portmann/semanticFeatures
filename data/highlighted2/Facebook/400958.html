class='textDiv'>Does Q Earnings Make Einhorn Right On Yelp Yelp NYSEYELP Seeking Alpha Since David Einhorn announced he was long Yelp theres been a renewed interest in the companys potential and valuation Following strong Q earnings investors may be even more convinced by his thesis Yet even with the outlook seeming bright investors should be aware of the numerous competitive pressures and risks Yelp faces Unless theres a near term sale of the company Yelp faces the risk of becoming obsolete as competitors such as Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may be better positioned To be frank I use Yelp NYSE YELP all the time Whenever Im looking for a business or restaurant review I always seem to end up on Yelp Then again I always used to use MapQuest as well until Google NASDAQ GOOG swooped in and took over the space While I partially agree with David Einhorn that Yelp is impressive and quite dominant because of its massive database of reviews Im not sure how long that will last as competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Google gain ground Revenues were up quarter over quarter Cumulative reviews were up quarter over quarter breaking the mm mark Adjusted EBITDA was down to mm compared to mm in Q Notably stock comp was mm which is much greater than Adjusted EBITDA and a bit ridiculous in my opinion Revenue guidance for is expected to be in the range of mm to mm Adjusted EBITDA guidance for is expected to be in the range of mm to mm Notably stock comp guidance for is expected to be in the range of mm to mm which again is practically all of the companys EBITDA If Yelps stock price begins to appreciate to levels that Einhorn expects that stock comp will most definitely be a real expense When you want look up a review for a business or restaurant do you Yelp it or Google it I can pretty confidently say that most people will head to Google first THEN click on the link to a Yelp review Thats the key problem with Yelps business model Most users dont start out at Yelp Google is the real middleman here Notice Google Reviews starting to pop up more and more when you do a search Why bother with Yelp if Google already has the results you need As Google begins to generate a bigger and bigger base of reviews users wont need Yelp any more Yelp could go the way of MapQuest and end up an afterthought Googles not the only threat to Yelp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could become just dominant too More and more businesses are starting to promote their businesses on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>At the same time advertising spend has taken off at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and it has proven quite effective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can offer companies and advertisers much more than someone like Yelp can The key is that Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are PLATFORMS Yelp is just a website I believe its only a matter of time before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or Googles reviews database is just as competitive as Yelps Yelps main advantage now is that they do have the most dominant source of reviews Theyve got a nice head start on their database of reviews along with a base of users that are pretty familiar with using Yelps platform Then again users are just as familiar with using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google just havent caught upyet Einhorn is probably right when he says there would be a bidding war for Yelp if it was put up for auction Someone like Google or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could easily just roll Yelp into their platform further bolstering their database of reviews The question is for how much Einhorn seemed pretty convinced that Yelp could hit mm of EBITDA by I would have to think hes adding back stock based comp seeing as Yelps true projected EBITDA for would only be to mm if they didnt add back their ridiculous amount of stock comp If we assume they hit that mm mark in and mm of that is stock comp the companys real EBITDA would only be mm placing a x EVEBITDA multiple on the company That may look low to you but remember this is a estimate and the acquirer will most certainly be paying that massive stock comp expense if they buy Yelp Im not one to make a bet on companies solely based off of a potential future acquisition especially when its valuation would be based off a dramatically larger year EBITDA estimate Im a bit too skeptical on Yelps long term prospects to get comfortable with an investment here More importantly the valuation just seems a bit too ludicrous with such a ridiculous amount of stock comp representing the companys adjusted EBITDA While the quarter looked good I wonder how many more quarters the company will have before Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>start eating their lunch Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
