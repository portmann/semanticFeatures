class='textDiv'>Ackman Takes Another Blow Bezeks Daily Briefing Seeking Alpha Herbalifes agreement with the FTC doesnt look so good to me However the stock is up big as the market continues to punish Mr Ackman Pokemon Go probably not the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>killer Markets are still quiet so lets not waste too much time with a recap of either Thursdays session or Fridays thus far generally dull trading Heres whats on my mind ahead of the weekend Citron Research a leading short seller and one of my favorites on the bear side has been hinting at a negative take on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB for awhile Last month Citron tweeted that it was to publish a view on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but decided to wait given the tragedy in Orlando Citron broke that twitter silence with a tweet about the company a couple days ago suggesting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could be the big loser from the success of Pokemon Go And yes at first glance that chart seems pretty powerful In barely a week Pokemon Go has managed to overtake all the major platforms and surge to the top of the usage leaderboard However I dont think this is a huge longterm blow to Facebooks prospects Social media games never have the sort of sticking power that broader platforms do Games such as Farmville and Candy Crush lead to significant market caps for their owners for a time but never anything to rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Stated otherwise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will still be somewhere on that chart next year where Pokemon is likely to already be out of the top While the game is revolutionary and has opened a new pathway as far as game development goes its hard to believe Pokemon Go itself is going to remain extremely popular once the initial wave of curiosity and nostalgia passes Make no mistake Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY and its partners have done an absolutely fantastic job bringing a wellloved older bit of intellectual property back into the mainstream But dont expect this Pokemon craze to last nearly as long as the original one did To the point that Citron is getting at with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>its true that change does come quickly and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is likely to be toppled from its current spot I dont think Pokemon Go itself is a huge threat but its a strong reminder that consumer preferences particularly among young users change at a lightning pace As I noted in my article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Is Turning Into AOL the company is acting like a private fiefdom that can abuse and ignore its users see the userunfriendly and unpopular decision to split messenger from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself among others Younger users have long thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt cool anymore and engagement overall is dropping as fewer and fewer users post anything personal anymore By getting everyone onto the site now fewer people want to post since there are so many consequences to accidentally putting up something that could create trouble amongst your hundreds of friends or distant family members For the more intimate and personal stuff many users are heading to Snapchat Private CHAT or other more private platforms While Pokemon Go is unlikely to be the thing that sends Facebooks traffic into terminal decline its a good reminder of how quickly internet interest can move from one seemingly big thing to something totally different If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt focus on restoring the user experience to previous levels youre going to see some bad trends coming in usage and ad revenues over the next months At this point youd have thought wed wrung just about all the possible drama out of the Herbalife NYSE HLF story already But the excitement just keeps coming Shares have opened about higher Friday morning on news that the FTC has reached a settlement with the company On first glance this seems like an odd reaction the FTC made Herbalife disgorge million of profits and essentially forced them away from the current MLM structure Going forward of sales a huge amount must go legitimate end users or distributor payments will be forced to decline Almost undoubtedly foreign regulators will use this decision to fine the company and force similar agreements overseas Its not hard to imagine the companys revenues really taking a hit as people realize that merely attracting more distributors below them no longer is the path to big dollars The FTC chairwoman stated that This settlement will require Herbalife to fundamentally restructure its business so that participants are rewarded for what they sell not how many people they recruit This hardly reads as bullish for Herbalife Yes its better than being fully shut down but it seems like a major negative development So why are shares higher That answer is simple Herbalife put a good enough spin on the news in its press release to leave things ambiguous and given the chance the market decided to turn it into another punish Ackman moment Pershing Square is obviously hurting Valeant NYSE VRX continues to hurtle lower and insiders and other major investors are bailing out The street tends to prey on funds it views as weak figuring that if you cause them more pain their investors will pull out forcing the fund to liquidate at bad prices In short its a selfgenerating squeeze that often causes sinking funds to fail outright Since Ackman got himself into this public and bitter battle other big fund managers are happy to kick him while hes down The FTC settlement announced today coming after a twoyear investigation also concluded that Herbalife is not a pyramid scheme a conclusion that obviously vindicates our research and conviction While Bill Ackman and I are on friendly terms we have agreed to disagree vehemently on this subject Simply stated the shorts have been completely wrong on Herbalife Its arguable whether the shorts have been completely wrong You dont usually get fined million for nothing nor have your business model forcibly reorganized by the government But this was less about Herbalife and more a battle of egos between famous fund managers And on that front Ackmans losses keep piling up Always do independent
