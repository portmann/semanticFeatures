DollarMenu Brave a new privacy and speedfocused web browser helmed by Mozilla cofounder Brendan Eich has a plan to get you to unblock ads First announced in January Brave is a web browser for Windows Mac Linux iOS and Android that has ad blocking built in But instead of eliminating ads entirely Brave wants to replace them with speedier nonintrusive ads from its own network Users who agree to see these ads will then get paid in bitcoin Under this plan advertisers pay for a certain number of impressions and Brave aggregates those payments into one sum Websites that participate in the scheme get percent of the money weighted by how many impressions are served on their sites Brave then divvies up the remaining bitcoin between itself its admatching partner and the users each getting a percent share For both users and publishers Brave deposits the money into individual bitcoin wallets and both parties must verify their identity to claim the funds This requires an email and phone number for users and more stringent identification steps for publishers Users who dont verify will automatically donate their share of the funds back to the sites they visit most Wed SmittyinLA Wed Kprime Wed
