<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is set to announce Q FY results on Wednesday July after the close We believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will beat estimates We are concerned with the companys valuation and the stocks runup performance in an otherwise flat market Tech giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc NASDAQ FB is set to announce Q FY results on Wednesday July after the close The Street is looking for EPS of on revenues of billion FB Revenue Quarterly data by YCharts Q FY results came in weakerthanexpected for FB due to forex headwinds Revenues increased YoY to billion based off of a increase in MAU to billion and increase in ARPU to MAU and ARPU trends have been strong of late especially in AsiaPacific markets The main driver behind Facebooks impressive revenues is the companys ads Facebooks COO explained their plan for improving continued revenues from their ads by improving user interaction with ads targeting users and general ad customization In our view if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can continue to optimize their ad penetration and feedback they will have great success reaching similar monetization levels for Instagram and WhatsApp For Q FY we have projected revenues using historical growth rates for ARPU and MAU as we have not identified any significant catalyst that should thwart strong ARPU and MAU trends It is estimated that there are billion internet users in the world and Facebooks MAU was billion MRQ In our eyes Facebooks addressable market is currently twice the size of its current user base Facebooks revenues are segmented into advertising and payments and other fees To keep our projections simple we will assume that payments and other fees will stay constant to Qs number of million This is consistent with historical data To get to the Streets revenue estimates assuming MAU stays constant ARPU must increase to If ARPU is constant then MAU must grow to billion users If we take a historical MAU growth of Q FY MAU will grow to billion and if we take a historical ARPU growth of Q FY ARPU will increase to Taking these projections our Q FY advertising revenues come in at billion Next we have to add back our payments and other fees revenue of million to bring net revenues to billion beating estimates by million We feel that FBs huge scope of products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger Instagram Whatsapp and Oculus poise them for further growth moving forward Our concern though is valuation based Of the billion potential internet users let us say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can net about billion MAUs for FacebookMessenger combined up from billion MRQ billion MAUs for WhatsApp and million MAUs for Instagram by implying net MAUs of billion by up from roughly billion MRQ Let us assume monetization flows to Instagram and WhatsApp and continues to grow on all platforms to ARPU of roughly by This all implies roughly billion in annual revenues by ARPU billion users quarters A consistent profit margin implies billion in annualized revenue which equates to EPS of on billion shares out If we use analyst consensus estimates for and EPS and then a straightline CAGR from EPS to our forecasted EPS then we arrive at fair value of per share This fair value is derived from a DCF model with perpetuity rate and a CAPM discount rate Our assumptions herein are quite bullish as we assume that not only does ARPU and MAU for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continue to grow but also that the company is able to monetize its other platforms as well as grow MAUs for each platform While these assumptions are not unrealistic they are bullish Considering a bullish model lends itself to an intrinsic value of per share we are not particularly bullish on FBs current valuation as we feel it does not equip investors with favorable asymmetry heading into earnings We were proponents of the stock earlier in the year but are now worried about the companys steep valuation All that said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could deliver a blowout quarter and shares could pop ignoring the stocks rich valuation This however does not seem like a shrewd investment and as such we are profittaking
