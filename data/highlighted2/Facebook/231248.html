reported a strong Q ER that topped estimates across the board Revenue came in at billion higher than a year ago and above the consensus for billion Ad revenue grew a betterthanexpected YY to billion The company continued its mobile dominance with mobile DAUs growing YY to million and mobile MAUs growing YY to billion Facebooks investments in its ad business are paying off hugely and although margins are compressed we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has shown that its spending generates strong revenue and user growth tailwinds Shares have soldoff after touching in trading the day following earnings likely due to investors worried that a potential rate hike could impede corporate ad spend We believe this selloff is a good time to add Given the strong user growth and engagement in the quarter we have updated our fair value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to display excellence on its video ads platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users now watch billion videos per day up from the billion daily views reported in April In just a few months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has doubled its daily video view count Some argue that Facebooks video view count threshold is too low and that the billion daily views number is deceiving YouTube counts views as a video that has been watched for seconds or more whereas the threshold for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is merely seconds or more We agree that it is rather easy to rackup views with a second watching threshold and Autoplay video feature that instantly plays videos when you scroll From this standpoint the billion views per day might be inflated We are however more focused on the growth from April than the absolute number Views doubled from billion to billion and we believe this is indicative of significant growth regardless of viewing threshold or absolute view count <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is continuing to benefit from strong synergies between News Feed and video discovery According to CEO Zuckerberg a vast majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>content is people scrolling through their News Feed and discovering content through either suggested content or content posted by friends Facebooks News Feed should continue to promote video discovery as user growth continues to be strong Although this was not mentioned on the call we believe YouTube Red is actually presenting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with an opportunity to upgrade its video content YouTubes odd coercive deal for content creators is causing them to lose valuable content Because YouTube is trying to create uniformity among its content creator base YouTube is forcing all of its content creators to be supported on both the paid YouTube Red and the free adssupported YouTube Those content creators unable or unwilling to sign up for YouTube Red will have their videos made private While YouTube claims that of their content creators agreed to YouTube Red terms one such notable content creator that hasnt is ESPN Due to a series of licensing conflicts with professional sports leagues ESPN cannot feature its videos on the paid YouTube Red As such most of ESPNs YouTube channels have gone dark and very little ESPN content is now available on YouTube The nowempty main ESPN YouTube channel has million subscribers and this is only of the ESPN YouTube channels Of those channels have gone dark This is a significant hit to YouTubes free content library YouTube Reds cannabilization of its free service and loss of some content notably ESPN content provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with an opportunity to upgrade its own video content Specifically it gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>an opportunity to expand its video content that is not available on YouTube and we see this as valuable going forward as YouTube and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>battle for ads revenue Overall we are bullish on both Facebooks recent video ads update as well as growth prospects into the future for further monetization In the quarter Worldwide ARPU growth moreorless met our expectations as some geographies performed better than we expected while APAC lagged due to FX headwinds US and Canada ARPU growth in the quarter was strong but continues to slow on a YY basis We expected a hike in YY ARPU growth due to the prevalence of video ads but the continued trend of slowing YY ARPU growth shows signs of difficulty in accelerating YY ARPU growth from a level We have pulled our US and Canada ARPU growth projections down slightly Europe ARPU only grew QQ but YY growth accelerated roughly basis points This was a bigger hike in Q ARPU than we were expecting and we have accordingly adjusted our Europe ARPU projections upward APAC ARPU was disappointing with both QQ and YY growth decelerating more than basis points A majority of this was driven by nonterminal FX headwinds and we expect these to ease sometime in the future We have kept our APAC ARPU projections unchanged Rest of World ARPU growth was impressive and inline with our expectations We have kept our Rest of World APRU projections unchanged User growth was very strong during the quarter and we have hiked up our MAU projections in all but one geography as a result US and Canada MAU growth was impressive during the quarter with the fastest QQ growth in the past two years far exceeding our expectations We remain however concerned that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is reaching MAU saturation in the US and have kept our MAU projections unchanged Europe maintained strong YY MAU growth of and this was better than we expected We have accordingly hiked up our Europe MAU projections as we believe the European market is far from saturated at million monthly users MAU growth saw particular strength in APAC and Rest of World APAC MAU growth accelerated to YY in the quarter while Rest of World MAU growth accelerated to YY We are bullish on the accelerating growth trends in these two regions likely boosted by the Internetorg initiative which has now brought more than million people online and we have significantly hiked up our MAU projections in both of these regions Given our updates to our ARPU and MAU forecasts outlined above we now expect revenues of billion in We now expect the company to hit revenues of nearly billion by We believe there exists a large amount of growth in the digital ad spend area and we expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to continue to capitalize on this increase in demand Operating margins compressed roughly basis points to as expenses were up YY led by RD more than doubling YY This was expected though as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>did say this was going to be an investment intensive year These investments in the ads business have paid off as user engagement and user count is soaring GAAP operating margins are well off the highs of reached in Q but are expanding marginally QQ proving that heavier spending is paying off in sales ramp We have maintained our margin guidance into which calls for margins to improve but not return to their plus highs Despite this heavy investing capital expenditures were actually lower than we expected in the quarter Capex for the quarter was million and management is guiding for capex for the year between and billion We believe our original forecast for capex to fall between to billion per year is an overestimation relative to the managementguided Fy capex which is markedly lower We believe capex will remain in the to billion per year range to support a more complex data center infrastructure While net cash flow in the quarter was million net cash grew to billion in the quarter thanks to an increase in marketable securities The company also netted free cash flow in the quarter of billion Our Q Update DCF Model can be seen below The major changes are slightly higher revenue forecasts and lower capex forecasts We use a WACC discount rate and add back in net cash to arrive at a fair value of billion On MRQ weighted average diluted share count of billion this equates to a fair value Despite trading at alltime highs and eclipsing a billion marketcap we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>still has room to run There remains a significant amount of traditional ad spend to shift to digital ad spend particularly mobile ad spend over the next years and Facebooks current strength in digital and mobile advertising positions it well to benefit from this continued influx of digital and mobile ad spend dollars We only use your contact
