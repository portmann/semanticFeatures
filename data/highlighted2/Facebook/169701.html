recent fundamental performance hasnt been bad though Were not happy with Alibabas NYSE BABA share price performance It has been one of our rare losers in the Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio Our thesis on Alibaba continues to be a longterm one however and unless China enters a year bear market never again reaching the heights of yesteryear were not worried about it But that said were not oblivious to the near term and may lighten up on the dwindling position in hopes that a better lower price can be established We wont harp on Alibabas fiscal firstquarter results released August which showed revenue advancing nearly and earnings coming in a better than expected at per share We thought the Street would be disappointed no matter what and they were Healthy gross merchandise volume which grew to an incredible billion up billion from the yearago period and strong monetization of mobile traffic in the quarter were highlights For the first time in Alibabas history mobile revenue exceeded desktop revenues in its China retail marketplaces Unlike some of the dotcom bombs of yesteryear Alibaba pulled in nonGAAP free cash flow of billion in this quarter alone Thats a solid level of free cash flow generation for a company that continues to invest rapidly in growth projects the latest a strategic partnership Financial Times subscription required at link with Suning Commerce The presentday situation with Alibaba is certainly different than that which happened to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB but we remember the trajectory of Facebooks equity performance quite well For those that may not remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>performed incredibly poorly following its initial public offering falling well below per share only to quadruple in the coming years to approach the century mark Facebooks initial offering was so bad that it was called the Faceplant IPO and while we were quite skeptical following the initial issuance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares weve been calling the company undervalued since We had an fair value estimate on shares in early November when they were trading below Frankly we should have added Facebooks equity to our portfolio at the time we added options Yet another mistake Part of the reason why we still like Alibaba has a lot to do with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>story For one we havent seen anything yet Alibaba has only been public since late last year and we have every reason to believe that the longterm story at Alibaba is extremely bright Not only is Alibaba fighting bad press regarding corporate governance concerns in the midst of a Chinese equity market collapse but investors continue to evaluate overall performance of its monetization rate which doesnt necessarily give credit to the pace of topline growth at the business Still the Chinese Internet giants mobile monetization rate was in the most recentlyreported quarter up basis points from last years measure and basis points sequentially The market seemed to be looking for something on which to base a sell decision on but the measure showed strong improvement We continue to believe the right question investors should be asking with respect to Alibaba is not what its free cash flow will be next quarter or next year but just how large and affluent the Chinese middle class will be in the coming decades and which companys name is synonymous with ecommerce in the country Thats Alibaba We fully expect shares to face continued pressure until sentiment improves across China but we think the company is a longterm winner Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
