the scales in the presidential election against Donald Trump After CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the political positions of Donald Trumps presidential campaign during the keynote speech of the companys annual F developer conference I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others Zuckerberg said never referring to Trump by name I hear them calling for blocking free expression for slowing immigration for reducing trade and in some cases even for cutting access to the internet For a developers conference the comments were unprecedented a signal that the yearold billionaire is quite willing to publicly mix politics and business Gizmodo reports that inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the political discussion has been more explicit Last month some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>employees used a company poll to ask Zuckerberg whether the company should try to help prevent President Trump in Every week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>employees vote in an internal poll on what they want to ask Zuckerberg in an upcoming QA session A question from the March poll was What responsibility does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have to help prevent President Trump in As Gizmodo adds its not particularly surprising the question was asked or that some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>employees are antiTrump The question and Zuckerbergs statements on Tuesday align with the consensus politics of Silicon Valley proimmigration protrade proexpansion of the internet But now as The Hill reports a spokesperson for the company says it cannot confirm or deny leaks but bristled at the suggestion it would seek to help or hinder any political candidate We encourage any and all candidates groups and voters to use our platform to share their views on the election and debate the issues the spokesperson said in a statement We as a company are neutral we have not and will not use our products in a way that attempts to influence how people vote Which seems in direct opposition to the clearly unneutral comments that Zuckerberg shared recently And one final thought while FB employees appear to be leftleaning safe spacecreating establishmentarians the firms billions of customers are most certainly not as is very evident by the soaring popularity of nonmainstream political parties around the world So the question that has to be asked is will Facebooks bias cost them millions in eyeballs Judging by this
