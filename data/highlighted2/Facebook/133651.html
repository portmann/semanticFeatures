style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may report subdued earnings and with Wednesdays release that is exactly what transpired The beat on the top and bottom line was more inline with last quarters results and less like the previous years blowout results But I also explained that this was completely expected and not a cause for worry since the company is deep in their investment year I examine the two quarters to understand if these subdued earnings were in fact due to continued investments Overall keep a longterm outlook on the company and stock as these investments will be the beginning of new growth In my article earlier this week detailing how I expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB to report subdued earnings I explained that this quarters earnings will look much like last quarters nothing of a blowout and probably close to consensus estimates This year as a whole has been and will continue to be a departure from Facebooks typical earnings releases where reported numbers far surpass Street expectations Instead this year due to the ongoing investments in the company through RD and marketing earnings numbers are far more inline with expectations Much like last quarter earnings only beat by cents while revenue beat by M Last quarter earnings beat was by cents and missed by M on the top line These are far different from prior years expectations where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in Q of beat by cents and M That was a bottom line beat where this years beats have been by margins of and respectively The reason for these more inline earnings numbers is due to the company investing within itself and its products Expansion of current products has taken a breather this year while management focuses on future growth catalysts to push the company further on the path of income expansion All of this is showing up on the costs and expenses line on this report and the last while surely the next two will as well As I briefly explained earlier in the week all of these investments and expenses are hurting the bottom line in a numbers sense but not a long term sense One can look at the report and see that GAAP EPS fell cents to from in the prior years quarter good for a drop At first glance and without any prior understanding one would think this is a glaring red flag How can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>who is considered a growth company and a domineering force in its sector be showing a reversal in its bottom line The problem is looking at this bottom line during this investment period The key is the top line where revenue has been growing at a clip and more if it wasnt for forex headwinds This top line has been pretty steady the last several quarters even though it is slowing slightly For a growth company it is important that revenue continues to increase at growth pace I consider growth above to be a pace at which a growth company grows its revenues Anything above I consider to be super growth pace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>seems to be just outside this phase at this stage of their company but it is still comfortably within the growth pace As long as this top line number continues on this growth path then the investments can certainly continue to happen Now that we have two quarters in the books during this investment year I believe it would be wise to compare the two to understand the progress Moreover in order to understand how my preearnings article compares to the results we need to look at the margins and spending to see if they are indeed the reason for the subdued earnings Q GAAP operating margin was compared to Qs margin of It seems the heaviest spending was in Q while Q showed some easing of spending to help bring it up bps RD in Q was of revenue while Q was of revenue or bps lower Marketing and sales was of revenue in Q while Q was of revenue or bps lower GAAP Net income in Q dropped while in Q as I already mentioned it dropped This slowing in bleeding is a sign that investments were front loaded rather than back end loaded quarterly speaking Revenue in Q increased over the prior year while Q revenue increased over its prior year While a small deceleration it still is very comparable especially as currency headwinds continue to push against what would be considerably more growth Free cash flow came in at B this quarter while Q showed B This is a good sign that cash flow remains strong and is within a tight range quarter to quarter when compared to revenue It seems that these numbers show continued signs of investment as expected It seems so far that Q has been the highest investment to revenue quarter thus far and that Q showed signs of less investment intensity During the conference call management gave a tighter budget guidance for investments in the coming quarters as they expect full year GAAP expenses to be between instead of the previous range given This should give investors a better idea of how much expenses will impact the rest of the year I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to continue on this trend even though I believe a majority of the expenses are probably behind us at this point However I still expect a similar level of expenses to continue to the end of year At that time I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have finished absorbing their acquisitions made progress in their RD department where many of their expenses are contained and will ramp up current campaigns with Instagram and video ads and release new products that are being developed right now Management is focused on product development but more importantly product integration as slow and steady is a winning formula As I said in my earlier article continue to look long term on this company and stock because investment today is growth tomorrow When this giant finishes taking its recovery breath it may be time to sit back and watch the vision and growth come to life again Source Facebooks Earnings Were Exactly What I Expected Disclosure I amwe are long FB
