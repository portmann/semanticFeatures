money with a blog completely transformed my life You can read further in my monthly online income report updates But if you search online for how to monetize your blog and youre given the same tired advice everywhere place ads on your site use lots of affiliate links look for sponsors While those methods might still work theyre usually a gigantic waste of time for beginning bloggers requiring you to aggressively promoteother brandsfor little payoff Theres a better way to make money creating your own product I started with a completely unknown blog that madeno moneyunless you count the pennies I made with Adsense to making just under during the sixday prelaunch of my very first productIf I can do it you can too Step Create value consistentlyand for free If you cant earn peoples trust you certainly wont earn their money The essential first step to having a profitable blog iscreating value content for free Some bloggers skimp on the quality of their free posts and save the best material for people who will pay This is wrong Do whatever it takes to make them want to return to your blog and tell their friends about you Dont worry about the creative well running dry If you cared enough about a topic to dedicate a whole blog to it theres plenty more where those ideasfrom Since my blog is about helping people pursue their passion in life I created an page illustrated PDFcalled Stop Dreaming and Start Doing How to Actually Do What You Love andgave it away on my site for free I took my experience as a career counselor and psychotherapist and condensed it into a valuable guide that would motivate people to take action with their lives People still write to tell me how much they enjoyed reading the guide Step Stop talking to an empty room Most bloggers never gain traction with their ideas not because they dont have anything worth talking about but because their message isnt reaching enough people In other words theyre talkingto an empty room I learned this the hard way The first few blogs I started never got more than a a few dozenvisitors a day because I was so intent on getting the word out there on my own It wasnt until I started leveraging bigger wellknown sites that my blog garnered more attention and took off The best way to leverage the popularity of other sites is towrite for themLook for wellknown blogsin your niche and pitch an article that would bring tremendous value to their readersWhen you do this properly youll earn new fans and followers who want to know more about you and your platform I used this strategy when I pitchedan article to The Huffington Post last summer Within hours my pitch was accepted and my post was featuredon the site After successfully writinga few more articles for them I was givencontributor access The exposure I got from writing for them brought hundreds of new subscribers to my own my blog as a result Side note from Michelle If you are interested in starting ablog of your own I createda tutorial that will help you start a blog ofyour own for cheap starting atonly per month this lowprice is only through my link for blog hosting In addition to the low pricing you will receivea free blog domain a value through my Bluehost link if you purchase at least months of hostingFYI you want to be selfhosted This is essential if you want to monetize your blog as you will appear more professionaland this will help you monetize your blog tremendously My blogging income did not take off until after I switched to selfhosting Step Partner with the right people Searchsites likeBloglovinorBlog Search Engineto find other bloggers in your niche What things are they doing or writing about that you admire Find commonalities that you share with the person and then reach out to them on Twitter Link to a specific article of theirs and list something specific you enjoyed about it then suggest collaborating sometime in the future The key is to be authentic People willsense if youre just looking to use them as a means to an end Be genuine with your intentions to work together and seek to provide value for both of your audiences Speaking to your audience through your blog is one thing but most experts recommend havingan email list so you can message them personally But theres an even better way to engage with your readers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Dont worry Im not suggesting you send <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>friend requests to all of your followersInstead create a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>group of your blogbrand and invite your followers and email subscribers to interact with you there Sure not all of themwill have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but most will Not only is it more personal than email but followers can meet and engage with one another This builds a sense of community whilealso taking the pressure off you to facilitate every discussion I grew the People Passionate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>community to severalhundred people in just a few months simply by asking my email subscribers to join In the group I kept up with everyone by asking them what things they were working on and what they most needed help with This encouraged others to participate in discussion and also gave mea much better understanding of my followers biggest challenges Once youve followed all of these stepsyoure ready to make money with ablog of your own By this point youve established to your community that youre not some random internet marketer whos just out for their money Youve earned their trust and they believe in what you have to offer many of them willbe more than willing to pay for you for a resource youve taken the time to create As far as what product you can offer it can be anything a video tutorial an ebook an online course even coaching services The beauty of having a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>community is it allows you to validate your idea for a product or service before you even begin creating it all you have to do is ask if its something theyd be interested in buying I noticedthat my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>group had a lot of aspiring bloggers who wanted to know how to grow their blogs and write for influential sites like The Huffington Post So I asked if theyd be interested if I were to create an email course that outlined the entire process from buying a domain to growing traffic to monetizing their platform Thirty two peoplesaid theyd be interested in the course if I created it I spent three weeks writing and refining the course During my prelaunch saleI sold eightcopies netting me a few hundred dollars profit on my very first product Final thoughts aboutmaking money with a blog Profiting from your blogmeans thinking about the longterm Aim to provide value in everything you do for your audienceBuild a community that appreciates your work surveyyour followerson the things they need help with the most then use their feedback to create a resource that addressestheir needs When you focus on finding a productfor your customers and not vice versa you give yourself the opportunity to finally make money doing what you love Author bio Kevin is the founder of People Passionate a blog dedicated to
