books printed a CNNMoney article pegged the cost at to Now that the majority of books sold are electronic you can selfpublish for much less even for free But does that mean you have a better chance now at making money on that selfpublished book than you did when expenses were higher The three main online stores that sell ebooks are Amazons Kindle Store Barnes Nobles Nook Store and Apples iBookstore A few books are sold on other marketplaces as well such as the Kobo US bookstore and GooglePlay Books Authors can also sell their books directly to consumers on their own websites Since of all ebooks are sold on Amazon its often the first or only place new authors think of to sell their work And there are a lot of benefits to selling on Amazon Kindle books are easy to buy and the publishing process is straightforward On the flip side there are so many books selling on Amazon including those from unknown new authors like you that it can be hard to stand out from the crowd Amazon demands that you exclusively sell your book through them if you want to take advantage of many benefits such as the Kindle Lending Library and Kindle Unlimited Keep in mind that Amazon pays authors when people check out their books one ebook author said the Lending Library accounted for of his revenue The biggest disadvantage of selling with Amazon for many is that they just dont like the way Amazon treats its authors Apples iBookstore is gaining market share and as you would expect from Apple books published on this platform look beautiful But while Kindle books can be downloaded onto just about any device readers can only access iBooks on an Apple device such as an iPad or an iPhone which limits the market Nook seems to be getting squeezed out by the big two ebook stores and should probably only be considered as a secondary place to publish The bottom line is that you may sell more books on Amazon but some authors dont feel like thats a good enough reason to publish there I may not sell as many books with Apple yet but its a whole lot more fun working with them writes author Giacomo Giammatteo No matter which platform you choose you stand to make about a book if you sell your ebook for which is a popular price point Once youve decided where to sell your ebook youre not done making decisions You must decide whether to create and upload your ebook all on your own or to pay an epublishing service or distributor to do it for you The top services include BookBaby Smashwords and IngramSpark For fees of or more these services can format your book and upload it to multiple different ebook stores You can pay more for valueadded services such as editing cover design and even printondemand paper books What your ebook is about all depends on your goals If your motive is purely profit there are methods of figuring out which topics are most likely to sell books An anonymous author who claims to be making tens of thousands of dollars a month publishing short ebooks about pages describes his process for choosing topics on The Hustle I find books that are selling well check out their tables of contents and look at the negative reviews to see what they missed It may be disheartening for a hardworking writer to hear but this successful entrepreneur says that sales are driven mainly by the cover image and the book description The books content is the least important part of the process If your motive is more to get a great idea or story out into the world rather than just cranking out any title that will sell you should still do your research before you sit down and start writing If you have a blog poll your readers on what topics theyd most like to see expanded upon in a book If your book is in a genre or niche such as a cookbook study the topselling wellreviewed ebooks in that niche and try to figure out what you could add that hasnt already been done well Fiction authors can also benefit by looking at already published novels in their category to figure out both how to avoid writing books that have been done to death and to find out what types of novels are hot right now Once upon a time writers just turned in their manuscripts to publishers and left the advertising and promotion to the company But even authors with book contracts nowadays find themselves doing their own advertising and promotion Before you publish your book consider the investment of hiring a publicist to let media know about your upcoming release If youre publicizing it yourself write about your upcoming book on your blog and ask other bloggers to write about it as well You can also create a new blog just about the new book or about its topic in order to drive traffic to your book Dont forget good oldfashioned advertising Mark Dawson who says he makes six figures selling his novels on Kindle Direct pays a day to advertise it on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>according to Forbes Of about authors selling ebooks on Amazon only about less than consistently earn a year or better according to the website Author Earnings More than half of those are traditionallypublished authors So only around of all the people selfpublishing ebooks are making much money on it Thats not to say you cant One approach for ending up with more money in your pocket is to keep your investment low so that even if sales are modest you still keep some profit To save themselves from investing too much time some ebook authors suggest keeping books short since people are about as likely to pay for a page book or short story as they are for a fulllength novel Others minimize their time investment by outsourcing the cover art this guy gets all his covers designed on Fiverr or even the content Again its all about your goals If your dream is to delight readers with your imaginative novel or win a literary award youre not going to dash out an outline and hire a lowcost overseas writer to flesh it out But if your goal is to develop a passive income stream by pumping out titles a year outsourcing is probably your best option In the end the answer is that you can make a living selfpublishing ebooks but like a lot of business ventures most people who try it dont cash in If you decide to enter selfpublishing as a moneymaking venture make sure to research the market first and put in the time to create
