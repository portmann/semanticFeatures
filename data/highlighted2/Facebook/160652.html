people smugglers they hope will get them to a better life in Europe The USbased website and other social media that were once used to help mobilise the Arab Spring uprisings now host information services for those escaping the Syrian civil war and other conflicts in the region There refugees can find much of what they need to know right down to the prices fees bribes they will have to pay on

since It helped activists to mobilise protests against their rulers in countries such as Egypt Libya and Syria itself at the start of the Arab Spring and then became a means for citizens to report on the violence that followed It remains an important organising tool and a practical aid for those travelling to and then through the European Unions Schengen area states which have scrapped border controls between each other as they head north for countries such as Germany and Sweden where they hope help is at hand We use our smart phones primarily to have a GPS signal so we dont get lost said a Syrian refugee who gave his name as Ahmad at a Budapest railway station where he was camping last week with hundreds more refugees We use social media including WhatsApp Viber or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to communicate with people we know If they are already in western Europe they send information back to us to help us navigate the route he said That

agent Hafez a yearold refugee from Damascus said he had found his via social networks We got information about agencies prices fees bribes phones all logistical details he told Reuters in an interview
