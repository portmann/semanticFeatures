#A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is out with a new personal assistant called M I believe M could be huge well have to wait and see I make the case that M and several previous announcements are reasons to bet on the long end of Facebooks maturation curve with leverage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is out with a new development M which is yet another beta product that has incredibly farreaching totally overused but entirely true in this instance word coming disruptive potential and yet can also be a perfectly fitting overlay to the broader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform inclusive of Whatsapp Instagram Mentions etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is getting really really good at managing its stock and M is just another indication of this Both the equity management and the product innovation at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are reasons why I continue to hold longdated CALL options rather than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>common M is Apples NASDAQ AAPL Siri Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Now Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Cortana etc But it isnt Yes M is a personal assistant but it isnt just that M also has a human element Thats right real humans that may or may not be acting as M behind the scenes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently employs an unknown number of M Trainers that sometimes proceed to take a user request through the entire lifecycle without the algoM having anything to do with the request Thats right your own free personal concierge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing this on the front end to accomplish several things The first is to help better train algoM well what Ill refer to as algoM on nuances in language and on being more predictive faster easier to use etc Of course despite the overhead which well break out soon I think this is a really really smart idea Its easier to not annoy and alienate users while at the same time becoming completely useless to them on the front end than it is to do this and then beg users to come back on the back end American Express you should call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and ask it why its doing things in this order rather than the other way around oh but well break this out soon too Ms goal is to be the go to starting point for users when on a mobile device and in need of something most of us currently use a fragmented flow chart of options that include Siri Google search or maybe a particular app depending on use case for instance Yelp for restaurant reviews etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants M to be the default starting point for search and discovery when mobile You can imagine why The thing is if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is serious about this and all indications are that it is M already has capacity that none of the other personal assistants have Thats if you think about it asis with no further learning or evolution The fact that any machinerecognized errors or requests that it doesnt understand get sent to a human rather than a Siri response of Im sorry I cant help with that right now is a huge differentiator I think M is brilliant As with all things <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which the questions are always relevant when will this be monetized what about the overhead and what are economics Considering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is employing at least a small contingent of M Trainers you can imagine the overhead associated with this project is large on the front end That said to justify the risk and the investment the economics better be really really good on the back end maturation of the product andor we better be getting to these economics quick Not that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt have cash to burn or access to credit but investors always are and always should be worried about the bottom line First I want to say that scaling the M Trainer initiative doesnt make sense Lets just get that out of the way Theres no way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is going to employ the many thousands of M Trainers it would take to help service billions of users Its just not realistic at least not alone Second I want to say that I dont think M Trainers are a longterm initiative As they present a scale issue and hopefully at some point the algoM will have learned a thing or two from its human counterpart I just dont see the M Trainers not being moved out for a much smaller contingent of developers So its my assumption that the economics of this endeavor Im sure the initiative is money losing currently are never going to be worse than they are right now This is fine for now But what about economics of the future And what if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could hang on to a large M Trainer base on somebody elses dime Now were talking I think this is the way that M shapes up in the future I think as with Businesses on Messenger M is really being developed as a nonconsumer function Really consider that I think that M is Facebooks next evolution of Businesses on Messenger and its way to define a new nonconsumer vertical for customer service quite obviously I would think I mean think about it If Facebooks M is going to be recommending restaurants buying apparel items for people calling to set up cable at a new residence which it can do M can literally hold the line for you and work the automated phone dialer systems doesnt it make sense that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>eventually require some form of reimbursement for flowing traffic to particular vendors Or wouldnt it make sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to allow for preferential recommendation by M for a small fee Or maybe best of all doesnt it make sense for businesses to build out their own customer service teams read M Trainers Lite to service traffic being relevantly flowed to them I think it does If a user asks M what is the best credit card to use for travel benefits and M responds American Express Platinum please refrain from tarring and feathering me doesnt American Express want to seamlessly and without the user being notified take human control of M within the conversation once the user decides to proceed into the recommendation I think depending on Mdriven volume it certainly does I think American Express would pay handsomely for the opportunity to help destress the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>transactional volume And so like I said I think thats the future of M Trainers Companies hiring out customer service teams as they do with Zendesk NYSE ZEN powered Businesses on Messenger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the platform the businesses are the execution This if Im right should perpetuate Ms humanelement differentiation and continue to make M the premier customer servicepersonal assistant app in the tech universe If M has human controllers and nobody else does does anybody else even have a personal assistant app I dont think they do and thats the point trying to be made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>So view the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>economics of M as you will but realize that I dont think the economics do anything but get better Making this doubly attractive I dont think the value prop of M ever does anything but get better As M scales up and potentially as M builds out its M Trainer base potentially not on Facebooks dime the overall learning of the algo will only get better and better My assumption is that to be allowed to play businesses are going to have to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>access to all conversational data from all transactions Thats a literal Twitterverse NYSE TWTR sized realtime data flow that will help M learn and learn and learn this cadence continues on into perpetuity My advice would be as with all things <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>dont be a prisoner of the moment to M economics Focus on the long play here I think its going to be huge But again as with all things <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the economics of M arent and shouldnt be viewed as being limited to M itself Everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does in my opinion it does in an effort to make more holistic its model to make its model more defensive or to make its model more an ecosystem of capture Facebooks primary goal with everything isnt upfront economics its time on platform With scale and with volume everything can become economic Its the time on its platform across the ecosystem which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>sells to advertisers and marketers What algoMs learnings can do is better improve everything at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>They can help Facebooks News Feed algo make better recommendations which will data has shown improve engagement time on platform and overall user satisfaction They can help Whatsapps auto correct better work with new slang They can help Instagrams Discovery mechanism help make better recommendations for both users and brands They can help deliver Instant Articles to the most relevant feeds driving the efficacy of Facebooks content delivery engine The uses are nearly endless Imagine being offered a menu of photos from a prospective restaurant that M has recommended possibly sent by the restaurant itself after M handed the transaction over to the restaurant that have been curated from Instagram Maybe next imagine doubleblinded inapprealtime reviews are curated for you that have been taken from global Whatsapp conversations at random Of course none of this has been detailed as currently possible or even something M is targeting to do but the possibility is high visibility This is how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is going to flex its total platform in my opinion as it matures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is slowly building out an empire that can not only be helpful to everyday life as a sum of all its parts but one that can make smart suggestions that help make life better Getting a decision right or not having to wait on hold to set up cable is meaningful to overall happiness not just happiness with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or its platform M being successful is a multiplier for the entire platform and thats going to matter in a big way going forward Now if you dont absolutely hate the idea of M or if you dont think that this is going to be the straw that breaks the camels back you have to consider what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has done in regards to equity management and what that means as an investor First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is at no shortage for news Its seemingly constantly out with a bullish data point or a product update This helps keep investor sentiment focused on progress and helps keep institutional investors focused on forwardlooking possibilities not the company asis right now As the prospects of the company continue to improve using assumptions to be sure assumptions of market take rate and overall success so too does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>forward financial modeling Ive evidenced this before with but its worth reiterating Financial estimates for Facebooks revenue EBITDA net income and fully diluted EPS have all doubled since inception of estimates when viewing the fullyear cohort see graphic below This means that in the years since fullyear estimates were first made initial estimates of forwardlooking years in this instance are often made more than two years in advance of the actual underlying year that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has literally innovated itself into double the expected financial size and financial achievement For me at least this means that you should buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now for innovation it will announce later Put simply it is my belief that revenue estimates for Q that are currently being made will need to be positively revised at some point prior to actual Q as a result of future innovation announcements made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>If this happens <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares should be allowed to move higher as a result of greater financial expectations Ideas like M allow analyst to move forward exactly how rich Facebooks model should be ahead of it happening like they have done since inception of estimates which then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at least to this point shows progress towards realizing which then moves its share price higher and higher I think this was the big miss the industry didnt acknowledge when shares traded in the midteens after the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>IPO The market is now willing to buy next monthsnext quartersnext years Zuckerberg vision ahead of it being announced or realized I mean just take a look at these red lines in the charts below So for me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is and continues to be a longterm hold but a name that I think you have to buy and bet big on forward innovation Or at least the realization and optimization of already announced innovation I think that means you buy longdated CALL options to which Ive been open about owning I still hold these CALL options I think that if youre going to hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>equity right now at todays valuation youre really betting on the future anyways I think you might as well get levered up because if Facebooks initiatives fail to realize what is being priced into shares currently the market cap has a long ways to fall anyways Regardless of if you own common or CALL options I think you lever up the long end of the maturation curve and hope the cash flow output are as productive as theyre modeled to be at that point But Im a riskweighted investor and maybe you arent Do whats right for you But does it Well have to wait and see how M develops and to what amount of focus this endeavor becomes for the company In any case though I believe this is another example of the forward thinking of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and a reason for investors to at the very least look into if a leveraged bet makes sense Disclosure I amwe are long FB AAPL TWTR ZEN MoreI wrote this
