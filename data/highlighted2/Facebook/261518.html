class='textDiv'>Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Determine If You Get Your Next Loan Modest Money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has grown from being a social network to a part of the way of life for consumers around the world Now the company is working to become a way to get your mortgage and other loans approved I know when I first read the story I thought it was a joke However further research into the concept shows that the company is actually working to help gauge your credit worthiness based on your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>following Today well talk about how the company plans on gauging your credit worthiness whether or not this has a real possibility of coming to fruition and whether or not this will help FB to grow even further How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Plans On Gauging Credit Worthiness Over the years weve learned that consumers become who they hang out with to an extent Therefore when you hang out with professionals you have a higher probability of becoming a professional <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>believes that we can take this a step further In fact they believe that if you spend time with people that pay their bills on time chances are that you will too Adversely they believe that if you spend time with people that cant seem to pay their bills youre at risk of not being able to pay your bills too Really this isnt a joke <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>recently filed a patent for the authorization and authentication based on the individuals social network Under this patent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is hoping that they will be able to decide whether or not an individual is credit worthy based on their social following Essentially users would be given a score based on the users they are friends with If their friends have a history of paying their bills on time the score will be relatively high However if the majority of their friends dont pay their bills on time regularly the score will be low This is an interesting story because at first glance it doesnt seem like something that would lead to profit for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>However if done properly this could be a big income earner for the company The reality is that big banks are always looking for new ways to reduce risk associated with loans If FB can prove that the algorithmic process of gauging credit worthiness based on their social friends is working the company can partner with banks Under these partnerships FB would earn quite a bit of money by giving banks another way to determine risk Whether or not this is likely to work is a different story I agree that it could be productive but it could also give quite a few mixed signals So that is yet to be seen What We Can Expect To See From FB Moving Forward Moving forward I have overwhelmingly bullish expectations with regard to what we can expect to see from FB regardless of what we see from the new credit worthiness algorithm The bottom line is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is used by a massive amount of people and the company has proven time and time again that they are masters at monetizing their social network While the new credit worthiness algorithm has the possibility of increasing income thats still long off Nonetheless with what FB has done in the past there is no reason to expect the stock not to continue climbing Buy FB stock from TradeKing today and get cash If you enjoyed this post please consider subscribing to the RSS feed or you are welcome to leave a comment below Joshua Rodriguez is the owner
