<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a highly valued stock on a financial basis but is working on many projects that could change the future economics of the company drastically The companys dominance in mobile messaging and social media places it in the sweet spot of a rapidly growing trend in developed and emerging markets I believe the current valuation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should be viewed as an option on these future growth opportunities not just as a function of its market share of ad spend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has built a social media network that generates significant use on desktop devices and most importantly on mobile devices The companys market cap has grown rapidly along with its users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has B MAUs worldwide B DAUs and B mobile MAUs The user base is still growing and is composed of demographics which advertisers love millennials However as time goes on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has to continue to establish its relevance as millennials are fickle users and rapidly jump to new products In this article I will explain what I believe are the most important growth opportunities for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in the future emerging markets messaging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>MAI FB LiveSports Stadium and why I am long even though the stock is very highly valued on almost any valuation metric The main reason I am bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the possibility of the company dominating the mobile first world for the next billion or so mobile users In developed markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is fairly wellestablished and monetizing ads Users in developed markets such as the US and Europe have had access to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>news feed for the past years while smartphone penetration has grown close to saturation for example US has penetration UK While there will be continued significant revenue growth in the developed markets I view this business almost similar to Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL search business a cash cow that can be used to reinvest in future growth opportunities So why are the emerging markets and developing markets so interesting These countries are just beginning to develop economically stable middle classes with some disposable income Because of this late development these countries are able to jump forward on the technology curve and are adopting mobile phones as the primary computing technology first as its cheaper portable and has multiple functionality texting phone calls search etc In these countries the prepaid model dominates as consumers want to pay as you go since disposable income is limited This creates a unique opportunity for messagingsocial media platforms that can connect users for free or through limited spend One of the greatest examples of this is Tencents OTCPKTCEHY WeChat platform As the Chinese population have engaged in mobile WeChat took the opportunity to build a platform that is a combination of social media gaming messaging payments and commerce They did this by first creating a simple to use free messaging service and then building upon that existing user base In India most people use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>messenger and WhatsApp to connect with others over WiFi to keep costs down The use of these messaging apps drives users to sign up on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>where they then are exposed to new delivery of content shared by friends a much more useful way of content discovery then searching on Google So not only could Facebooks ad revenue dramatically expand with these new potential users but also the company has the opportunity to create a Wechat like platform in these markets This is not possible in more developed countries For example in the US we have multiple messaging apps social media accounts payment apps Venmo Square NYSE SQ cash all able to be funded by investors flush with cash A major driver of this future platform may be AI AI is important as it dramatically increases the usefulness of a messaging platform A great AI solution could replace Yelp Kayak OpenTable and possible damage Expedia NASDAQ EXPE and other OTAs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is currently experimenting with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>M which acts almost like a personal assistant It is essentially a chatbot that learns your preferences and can provide you with suggestionssolutions after reading the context of your message It will eventually be able to book you a flight reserve a restaurant provide you with movie suggestions based on your mood etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>M is currently a direct app that you need to chat with however in the future the AI should be able to monitor your messages amongst friends and be able to figure out what you would need Again it could become an allinone solution to replace many different appsservices Furthermore if SMS commerce picks up speed AI could drastically change how we shop on mobile rather than having to go through different apps An example of a startup that recently launched and is targeting this space is Conversable Being able to transact through messaging could allow AIenabled agents to better predict consumer items that you would like to purchase and enable a revenue share with the end retailer There are multiple startups targeting this space including Jack Mobile Operator and Magic so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>M may not be the leader in the space However if need be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should be able to acquire any successful startup and integrate that in with messenger In general I would say that these trends are huge headwinds for Google to maintain their dominance in search in a mobile world with the transactional nature of mobile search If AI chatbots are successful there is no need to search for items through Google on mobile Hence why Google is so focused on building its own personal assistant While these future growth opportunities are impressive reinvestment of cash flows will not be possible unless the core product continues to perform Recently troubling articles have exposed that the news feed may be experiencing an up to decline in original personal content shared This is concerning as ad revenue could decline if users flee from the news feed as it turns into a barrage of ads artists promoting themselves and news articles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has introduced some pretty amazing products to combat this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live and Sports Stadium These are basically better versions of what Twitter NYSE TWTR has tried to do already with Periscope Vine and Moments If you listen to any earnings call of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it is clear the video is a huge focus for the news feed as it creates higher engagement in personal content shared as well as ads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live is a beautifully executed version of Periscope allowing you to see concerts and exciting news stories shared by your favorite follows or your friends It keeps you engaged with what others are up to similar to a longer Snap on Snapchat Again this product attacks other companies Google and Twitter Twitters failure to attract new users with video sharing has been welldocumented even with their impressive product portfolio Google on the other hand has Youtube which is the leader in video sharing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live can take direct share from Youtube as artists post clips of themselves performing and users get to interact live with others and see each others comments to drive engagement Sports Stadium is another great way to experience major events that fans care about in an exciting manner It is an area where users can go besides having to go to another website or app such as Disneys NYSE DIS ESPN or Twitters Moments The UI is again beautifully executed and has video and posts shared from various fans who are viewing it live This is a much more engaged experience than simply viewing Gamecast or listening to commentators As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>rolls out similar products for other significant fan areas it becomes the goto place to discover content and makes the news feed even more interesting This will all help to garner more users and continue to enable the significant FCF generation coming from the main platform In conclusion although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is highly valued based on traditional valuation metrics there are several large growth opportunities ahead of the company that Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the management team are thoroughly focused on Execution on these opportunities could drive large TAM expansion which could expand further on the companys current valuation In my opinion you should view the current valuation as an option on these future growth opportunities Disclosure I amwe are long
