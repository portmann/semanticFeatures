class='textDiv'>Could Facebooks Valuation Be Too Excessive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebooks valuation remains a contentious issue in the tech investing community While theres no denying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt exactly cheap I believe that various growth drivers substantiate the valuation despite how excessive the valuation may appear The biggest issue with FB value analysis is the notion that DCF is the goto model for early growth phase companies Many have adopted comparative value estimates whereas members of the academic community have suggested qualitative metricsfailure probabilities to be implemented in financial models When pertaining to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>theres enough predictability and visibility to help mitigate quarterly misses and sustain healthy growth rates Hence the valuation premium seems substantiated due to its high predictability Over the past couple years the most heavily debated topic has been the valuation of highflying growth stocks I dedicate this article to further explore Facebooks NASDAQ FB valuation and define why instances of volatility tend to occur Furthermore I question conventional financial models when pertaining to earlystage or midstage growth companies Given the lack of operating history and uncertainty behind longterm forecasts it would take an immense amount of foresight to accurately determine sales and earnings going forward However I believe a strong investment case can be made despite uncertainty around longterm fundamentals Valuation frequently surfaces as a key theme for this battleground stock In the past many have agreed with my stance on growth but really cant stomach the valuation Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt cheap but theres no denying the quality of the business model and longterm growth potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the ability to increase pricing on ads and launch additional products ad infinitum Therefore the valuation is mostly supported by the companys ability to execute on nascent opportunities as they emerge Furthermore Instagram and WhatsApp have yet to reach the scale of FB but will likely do so given enough time I believe that these other platforms in conjunction with new growth opportunities like VR are driving speculation However the speculation around the stock seems to be grounded in reality Theres no denying that some of the buying also is driven by fear of missing out While we have witnessed cases in the past where a stocks valuation could no longer be supported by company fundamentals dot com bubble for example I view Facebooks unique positioning in a lot of social verticals healthy margins and continuous expansion of audience metrics provide enough evidence to support meaningful upward bias Facebooks valuation has expanded quite significantly following its IPO For the most part its difficult to say its cheap On the other hand theres still upside to sellside forecasts So I cant exactly say its priced to perfection Furthermore theres no denying that assessing the value of FB is difficult due to the limited operating history and uncertainty to longterm forecasts Nonetheless analysis is rooted on future value assumptions otherwise no one can rationalize what theyre paying in the present As such were basing everything on a prediction and for the most part the market is very optimistic on Facebooks longterm growth trajectory To that extent I do have to agree with the market despite how irrational it may look from the perspective of other analysts As you have all witnessed in the past many on Wall Street have thrown out DCF models because they have frequently witnessed these growth companies flying off to Jupiter leaving their DCF models on earth So these days we use comparative value and statistical measures to come up with a reasonable appraisal of value So while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trading at high valuations relative to its IPO date I think its business like usual for investors who can differentiate rampant speculation vs growth at a reasonable price However Im going to use a research study published in from Aswath Damodaran Professor at NYU Stern School of Business to help characterize the market inefficiencies of conventional models Hes one of few Finance PhDs in the world so hes worth listening to Young companies are difficult to value for a number of reasons Some are startup and idea businesses with little or no revenues and operating losses Even those young companies that are profitable have short histories and most young firms are dependent upon private capital initially owner savings and venture capital and private equity later on As a result many of the standard techniques we use to estimate cash flows growth rates and discount rates either do not work or yield unrealistic numbers While these approaches require us to estimate inputs that are often difficult to nail down they are still useful insofar as they force us to confront the sources of uncertainty learn more about them and make our best estimates While we may be tempted to add premiums to these values for potential opportunities that we see in the future the use of real option premiums should be limited to those companies that have some degree of exclusivity in exploiting these opportunities It has been a while since I found an academic thats wellversed on the topic of growth investing and the shortcomings of conventional financial models when pertaining to these companies However he identifies that a premium should be attached to companies that have exclusivity high market share durable advantage barriers of competition He then follows up by mentioning that a qualitative probability of success and aggregate business failure rates needs to be factored into longterm financial models Given what we know about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the company has a highquality moat and a high likelihood of success Its easy to deal with a steady growth stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>because we can simply separate the distinct growth variables and extrapolate them separately Furthermore the quality of management and various efforts to enter into new markets forces us to further extend our longterm growth forecasts which is why the stock defies the laws of gravity At some point every good growth story comes to an end but in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>weve seen the company continually reinvent itself This leads me to believe that there are at least several years before the growth rate starts to decelerate considerably While Damodaran provides a primer on almost every valuation technique used by analysts and alternative ideas on valuing earlystage growth companies I try to highlight the degree of difficulty to predicting sales and earnings I believe volatility in a stock is often misinterpreted as irrationality when in reality its just uncertainty about future value assertions on a forward basis Quarterly misses forces everyone to question their own respective crystal balls and while crystal ball forecasts are often frowned upon its the only basis by which we can arrive at a rational valuation for companies However I feel like the longterm time horizon of DCF makes it even more difficult to rely on especially on infant growth companies So theres a bit of an art and science to dealing with forward looking analysis and when the entire consensus gets this wrong the stock can only move up or down when based on efficient market hypothesis The market is only efficient when it accurately predicts the sequences of events that occur In every instance when it does not the market corrects aggressively more like chaotically which is why theres so much volatility around quarterly earnings reports This quarterly volatility is heightened when dealing with momentum names or deep value stocks Volatility seems to be more a function of unpredictability rather than irrationality However I believe theres enough visibility to Facebooks revenue and earnings to make it a worthwhile candidate despite the juxtaposition of market efficiency and modern valuation methods FB Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts In a sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>seems like one of those businesses that have much longer growth legs than what terminal value assumptions can insinuate And its why many analysts are hesitant when dealing with this specific company because later on down the road its hard to anticipate how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can pursue strategies to scale sales and earnings Furthermore the market tends to attach a premium on stable growth businesses Predictable largecap growth businesses trade at even higher valuations than smallcap counterparts growing at similar rates Investors value certainty and a broad consensus associates size with quality Conventional models have difficulty with capturing the upside but they also put a lot of pressure on analysts to accurately anticipate a stocks market value Despite these difficulties many of my prior calls on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>were right However like everyone else I have encountered instances where I have overestimated or even underestimated Im not saying Im always going to get it right but I think I have a broad enough outline to get a sense for where things are going I continue to reiterate my price target which implies upside from current price levels While I know valuing stocks is a touchy subject for growth stocks I believe theres enough tangible evidence to suggest that FBs valuation will
