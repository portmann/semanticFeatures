a corresponding decline in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>use or members but by a trend that can be seen elsewhere online a preference for video over text Mendelsohn states that the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is an allvideo platform including video and virtual reality The timeframe Roughly five years Thats right Five years from now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have transitioned to a videobased social media platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has already begun the beginning phases of this transition Users homepages are now populated with video content selected by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>algorithms Every day million hours of video are viewed on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>But this transition is not without hazards The downside is that the world already has a social media company monopolizing video YouTube In other words Facebooks future is to compete directly with Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL a formidable opponent For the transition to be effective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will need its video advertising revenue compensate for the lost text and image advertising revenue And this need can only be met by stealing market share from Google Remember Facebooks customer is the advertiser not the social media user For an advertiser with a video campaign to consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>instead of YouTube the default the advertiser must have a strong reason for believing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>video ads provide better ROI than those on YouTube Other factors such as ease of use or specific targeting also play an important role in the determination of an advertising platform Currently YouTubes video advertising system is hard to beat because of two major benefits The first major benefit of the YouTube advertising platform is that it really tips the odds in the favor of the advertiser In many cases ads run on YouTube are free as the advertiser is only obliged to pay if a user watches more than seconds of the ad or clicks on the add skipped ads do not eat into the advertisers budget In this way companies engage in zerocost brandrecognition campaigns in which advertisements are created to maximize skips within the first seconds The brand person or company name is still displayed to the viewer but at no cost to the company This sort of campaign combined with the second benefit of YouTube advertising video targeting can result in monstrous ROIs YouTubes video targeting is particularly remarkable Via video targeting an advertiser can place his videos before specific videos This effectively allows advertisers to hijack the viewers or subscribers of a competitors channel In my copywriting days I remember running campaigns specifically designed to usurp viewers of videos on specific targets Lets say known YouTuber X has a popular video on real estate investing I can create a video ad to play before that video with the goal of grabbing viewers that should have gone to YouTuber X In such a campaign my video would be relevant and give the viewer clear instructions either come to me in which case I pay for the view or skip the ad in which case I pay nothing but at least have shown the viewer my personality or brand An example introduction in such a video ad follows Youre about to watch a somewhat outdated method of investing in real estate by YouTuber X If you want to continue just click skip this ad below However if youre interested in learning a more modern method of investing in real estate click this video and Ill show you how its done As you can imagine this advertising methodology funnels only the best leads to my video while allowing those who are insistent on watching YouTuber X to skip my ad reducing my advertising expenditure Currently only YouTubes platform allows for such targeted lowcost advertisements This is what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>must compete with Nevertheless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has already mastered effective social media advertising via text and image advertising and can likely use their keys to success in the video format opening the door competition with YouTube Marketers know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers tactics that other social media platforms including Google and YouTube do not Many turn to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the first testing grounds for a new campaign Specifically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>holds the status of being the most targetable online advertising platform The ability to home in on user demographics at minute levels allows for nearly perfect accuracy in testing specific advertising theories Demographic targets such as life events below allow advertisers to ask questions such as Will new mothers be receptive to this product This tool can be easily extended to video advertisers giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>an advantage over YouTube Most video advertisers would at the very least test both platforms if not use both Then the war becomes one of ROI for the advertiser Its foreseeable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>takes at least half of YouTubes market share in this industry Again this all depends on the ROI seen by advertisers using the platforms The most likely result is that certain industries gravitate toward one platform over the other as a result of differences in the responsiveness of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users versus YouTube users But for now we can ignore the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>vs YouTube endgame as the transition from textimages to video itself is enough of a catalyst to form a bullish thesis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>A shift toward video content and advertising will increase engagement for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>keeping its users on the site longer and interacting with content at a higher rate The beginning phases of the switch are userbased attracting advertisers will come later and much of it organically As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>transitions to video content they will naturally solve the slowing growth problem via improved content preference lower bounce rates longer usage time and stronger memories associated with use These opinions are warranted as the statistics support online digital media as the usurper of television <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will organically draw revenue that was in the past meant for large television networks The transition to video is the right move here even if it brings FB into GOOGs realm But FBs unique tools will allow it to at the very least take a significant market share from GOOG as it grows in the video advertising realm I maintain my bullish thesis on FB but wish to extend it for the next five years FB investors should remember to account for volatility and seasonality But other than that FB is a strong longterm long position My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live here on Seeking Alpha In this newsletter we employ both fundamental and pattern analyses to predict price
