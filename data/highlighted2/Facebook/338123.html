iphone eff encryption fbi The day after Apple filed its formal objection to a Feb court order compelling the company to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that belonged to one of the terrorists who killed people last December in California a group of nearly four dozen tech industry experts have asked the court to rethink its decision The issue for those coming late to this story involves privacy protections on the iPhone If FBI agents fail too many times at guessing the correct passcode the information they seek could be wiped from the device In the hope of getting around this the FBI has asked Apple to push an update to this iPhone that would allow them to unlock the phone without the risk of erasing the desired content Apple contends that there is no legal precedent for forcing a tech company to make its devices less secure The company is also concerned that aiding the FBI by creating this hack would set a dangerous precedent Last week Apple filed its motion to vacate PDF arguing among other things that creating a back door to bypass iPhone encryption has the negative effect of making its users most confidential and personal information vulnerable to hackers identity thieves hostile foreign agents and unwarranted government surveillance This morning a supporting brief PDF filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and different experts attempted to bolster Apples position in this case What the government blandly characterizes as a request for technical assistance raises one of the most serious issues facing the security of information technology begins the brief the extent to which manufacturers of secure devices like Apple can be conscripted by the government to undermine the security of those devices The authors of the brief include professors in engineering computer science cryptography and other fields from MIT Rice University Cornell UC Berkeley Johns Hopkins University of Pennsylvania Yale Harvard Carnegie Mellon Princeton and numerous other institutions They contend that forcing Apple and its employees to create a workaround to effectively weaken the product they developed places a significant burden on their First Amendment rights The court has directed Apple to create this new code to assist the FBI In order for that code to work it must contain Apples digital signature which is an indicator that the company has approved and endorsed the code Since Apple would be doing this work under duress the tech experts say this would be compelling the company to violate its constitutional right to free speech Apples code and digital signature separately and together affirm a commitment and belief regarding the authenticity of the code and the value of their customers privacy and security explains the brief The order compels Apple and its engineers to repudiate that belief and undermine the very security they designed In other contexts compelled speech and affirmations of belief that substantially hinder the speakers ability to communicate its desired message are clearly unconstitutional In a statement EFF Civil Liberties Director David Greene likens the court order to the government forcing Apple to endorse something it cant possibly agree to In our democracy no one not technology companies coders or average citizens can be forced to write an article carry a sign post an update on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or write and sign computer code that communicates or endorses a government idea that they dont agree with explains Greene What the FBI asked the court to do violates free speech rights and puts the security and privacy of millions of people at risk We are asking the court to throw out this dangerous and unconstitutional order The Feb order to assist the FBI was granted under a statute known as the All Writs Act which allows a judge to compel a person or group to assist enforcing a court order but only if that assistance is both necessary and agreeable to the usages and principles of law However earlier this week a federal judge in a similar case in New York ruled that the All Writs Act did not give the government the authority to force Apple to assist the FBI And concluded the judge even if the Act did apply Apple was too far removed from the criminal conduct involved and would be unduly burdened by the requirements of such an order Apple FBI Testify About
