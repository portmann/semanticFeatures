class='textDiv'>Box A Stock To Avoid Box NYSEBOX Seeking Alpha Since it went public in Box has been a disastrous investment In a volatile sector its lack of competitive advantage is fatal in the long run Box Inc NYSE BOX has seen its share price plummet by since its IPO in January Last month the share price fell To put it simply this is not an investment that a profitoriented investor and there are other kinds if you want to believe the reasons certain breeds of activist investor provide for buying into a particular stock would want to have made So why has Box stock collapsed like this Founded in and based in Redwood City California Box Inc is a cloud storage and services provider with a market capitalization of billion and a plus client list including such firms as Proctor Gamble NYSE PG Alere Inc NYSE ALR GlaxoSmithKline NYSE GSK and Flir Systems Inc NASDAQ FLIR Boxs primary function is to provide a platform for its corporate clients to share and store documents and to collaborate online in creating content To their credit Box has managed to grow its customer base grabbing clients in the previous quarter And they have been able to grow revenue However cloudbased storage solutions are not enough to sustain a business and growing revenue has not translated into profit These issues are central to the problem with Box as an investment The subheading in this instance is key to why Box has been such a disappointing investment The firm possess no real competitive advantage in the sector within which it operates Cloud storage and service provision is a market with low barriers to entry and competitors that Box has to contend with include Alphabet Inc NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Amazon Inc NASDAQ AMZN IBM NYSE IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQ MSFT Every one of those companies are much larger than Box and each possess a huge portfolio of products and services that permit them to offer similar cloud services at a discount to Box undercutting them Box has attempted to collaborate with some of its competitors such as IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>In June Box and IBM teamed up to create a number of cloudbased solutions for corporate customers Box would benefit from access to IBMs portfolio of security and content management tools which could enhance their own cloud offerings while IBM could utilize Boxs platform by integrating it into their MobileFirst applications The deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also announced in June involved deep integration of the Box platform with various <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>applications such as Office However this has not stopped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>from releasing a Sharepoint upgrade which has mobile applications and which allows free migration from Google Drive and from Box In short these joint ventures into cloud service provision have not shielded Box from competitive threats nor have they enabled the firm to become profitable something it has never been in the years that it has been in operation Box is currently trading at around per share and earnings per share are for the last months The pricetoearnings ratio is Basically there is no margin of safety with Box stock whatsoever Net income figures over the past three years reveal a trend that makes it seem unlikely that the stock will recover any time soon Although revenue has grown with yearoveryear revenue growth of in the previous quarter the operating costs and ongoing reinvestment into the firm means that Box remains unprofitable For the period ending net income was For the period ending net income was Furthermore Box has a high debt burden of million with a debtequity ratio of Over the past months it has had an operating loss margin of and an average net loss of Suffice to say the company is in no position to pay a dividend so all that is left to offer shareholders is capital appreciation And the stocks trajectory since the IPO suggests that this is an unrealistic expectation too Boxs joint ventures with IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have not provided it with the financial viability that the company hoped for as the firm is still unprofitable and the share price continues to decline There are no guarantees that things will improve in the long run either the tech sector is very fastpaced and companies must innovate constantly to stay at the forefront Only two companies are truly battletested within the tech sector IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The likelihood of Box Inc joining these firms as venerable blue chips is very slim given its current status It has almost no competitive advantage within the cloud storage and services sector it has never been profitable in the eleven years since it started operations it has huge debt its stock offers no margin of safety pays no dividend and has little prospect of providing capital gains either Since the IPO its value has declined by more than half Consequently investors
