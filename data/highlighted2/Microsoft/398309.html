or introduce a new hit gadget soon Trading at just X earnings what Apple needs to do to get Wall Streets respect In this article I show why Carl Icahns valuation was off the mark what I believe a reasonable valuation for Apple NASDAQ AAPL should be and what Apple CEO Tim Cook needs to do to earn Wall Streets respect as well as unlock shareholder value Over the past two years Apple has grown its bottom line EPS by an average of One of the biggest reasons for such an increase has been because of Apples capital return program where the company has been buying back billion worth since But as we can see in the table below is off to a rocky start as its widely expected that Apple will see a dramatic drop on the bottom line YOY this year Prior to Q results estimates were for After missing expectations on both the top and bottom lines along with very discouraging guidance for the third quarter Apple announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of billion to the companys existing program with the plans to now spend billion by the end of March As part of the updated program Apple will also increase its share repurchase authorization to billion from the billion level last year This should provide support on the bottom line but wont do much going forward for its topline growth in the coming years This of course and as investors are finally figuring out is why the company is trading at a discount to the overall market While buying back shares is a resource to boost valuations and offset stockbased compensation it also has some drawbacks Instead of using its cash to make bigtime acquisitions among other things Cook seems content on just keeping things status quo This is why I believe Cook needs to start making some moves that will benefit the company on a longterm basis as well as unlocking shareholder value at the same time for a winwin situation Steve Jobs Apples cofounder and former CEO was notorious for taking on risks Sometimes it worked out and sometimes it didnt But the main thing was that he kept working on and ultimately delivering the next big thing Meanwhile Cook hasnt done much of anything since taking over as CEO Now Apple has turned into a copycat as its products take pages from companies such as Samsung OTCSSNLF and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>debuted its Surface tablet in cartoonist Joel Watson drew an amazing prescient comic pardon the profanity at the link predicting a typical Apple move in the coming years which has come to pass This is why shares consistently tank right after the companys special September event Investors dont care about new phone colors etc but closely watch for new products and hints about whats ahead for the company And if management isnt careful Apple could follow other notable companies such as IBM NYSE IBM into the death by buybacks Once valued at more than billion and despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars in stock buybacks over the past decade shares of IBM have and continue to go down Investors everywhere particularly the mom and pop investors love to track what hedge funds money managers activist investors etc are doing with their money The thinking goes that based on their history net worth popularity etc that these guys cant lose with all of the resources they have at their disposal Surely these guys are a lot smarter than the average Joe right Now Im not saying he wasnt profitable by any means as he claimed to have made over billion in profit but here are several reasons why I never jumped on the AppleIcahn bandwagon train Apple TVs In one of his open letters to Cook Icahn wrote about how Apple was poised to enter several new markets Apple is poised to enter and in our view dominate two new categories the television next year and the automobile by with a combined addressable market of trillion a view investors dont appear to factor into their valuation at all Source Yet despite speaking numerous times with Cook Icahn clearly didnt understand what the company was about In the same letter Icahn predicted that Apple would start selling inch and inch ultrahighdefinition sets in generating revenue of billion in alone But wait heres the kicker Hows Apple going to generate those profits in a product that it isnt even going to produce Not long after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple shelved plans more than two years ago on the television units That was the first of many daggers for Icahn in his attempt to pump up prices Unrealistic Price Target In another one of his letters Icahn forecast fullyear EPS for and at and respectively Yet realistic expectations such as mine were much much lower than that Fast forward a bit and here we are with EPS expectations for Apple of just and in and Thats nearly a miss Icahn also gave Apple a market multiple of despite history showing us that shares havent traded that high in years Shares have been stuck in the range Icahn even went on to claim that is X multiple was very conservative saying with a combined addressable market size of trillion we think a multiple of x is a very conservative premium to that of the overall market Considering the massive scope of its growth opportunities and track record of dominating new categories we actually think x will ultimately prove to be too conservative Yet with his price target and Apple is a nobrainer comments Icahn announced last week that hes sold his entire position at a time when shares were trading at less than a share Apple is still the most valuable company to date B but its rivals arent far behind Google Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is valued at B <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stands at B and social media giant Facebook NASDAQ FB sits at B Since initiating his position in Icahn has turned into Apple into a buyback machine for his personal gain Over the nine quarters that Icahn owned shares in Apple the iPhone company spent nearly B worth in buybacks Acquisitions And Why Apple Needs To Tell Its Story Apple could have very well spent that B on acquisitions as it looks to diversify from the iPhone hold which produces a large majority of its revenues nearly And its not like the company is short on cash with more than B at the end of the quarter Even so that B on buybacks could have been used instead to acquire companies such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX with plenty of cash left over Now Im not saying thats what it should have done or should do but that investors are looking for the next big thing and the Apple Watch certainly isnt going to move the needle Many even consider it a bust after waiting five years for Apples next big thing Tesla and Netflix continue to get premium valuations from the market because of the growth and because of the story these companies have laid out for investors Apple doesnt have that right now as we witnessed with Icahn Despite his many meetings with Cook even the billionaire himself didnt have much of a clue as to where the company was headed and what the company was actually working on Simply put investors and analysts need a clear picture from management and if improvement isnt made Apple will continue to trade below the market averages Think about it iPhones represent close to of revenues for the tech giant Now what happens when sales start to slow as weve seen Based on the markets reaction over the past several years investors simply dont know Apples story Every day there seems to be a rumor that Apple is getting into the ______ fill in the blank business Remember those ultrahighdefinition television sets that were coming out in Also the lack of diversification and the reliance on a maturing and stalling smartphone market has turned off shareholders In China where Apple was expected to deliver dominate growth over the coming years saw a percent sales decline Not only that but also risks still lie ahead due to the unpredictability of the Chinese government This year China shut down iTunes Movies and iBooks just six months after they were released This isnt new as Facebook Google IBM among many others that have run into many stumbling blocks in China Heres something to think about Where would shares be if it wasnt for the massive buyback program over the past several years Would shares have been in the and s without the support from the buyback plan or would shares have rallied on speculation that the company was saving its cash to make some big moves Either way there are several positive and negative takeaways right now While seeing players such as Icahn move out isnt a welcome sign to many investors its also a breath of fresh air for some as all of the drama that Icahn brought slowly disappears So where do I believe Apple goes from here over the next months Well it depends on several things The most important nearterm event that investors need to pay attention to is the allimportant level Over the years shares of Apple have bounced at this crucial point in time as you can see in the image below If Apple continues to repurchase shares at a fast rate which it has been known to do and make some acquisitions along the way I see shares running up into the range and even higher depending on the type of acquisition At the same time if shares far below the level investors should expect shares to test the level which implies downside of around from Mondays close Based on the current mood from investors I believe the market will value Apple based on X to X earnings a drop from to based on what weve seen in the past Shares are currently trading at X earnings and will likely trade sideways over the next year or so barring any acquisitions or new product launches I believe shares would be a nobrainer if they were to fall into the low range and would look to lock in profits in the range I dont see enough catalysts this year to offset the disappointing sales growth which will likely keep shares in check Lastly just because Icahn bailed on Apple doesnt necessarily mean you should too The company has a rocksolid balance sheet great margins and a loyal customer base is just shaping up to be more of a transitional year for the company And because of this I believe there are better investments out there that offer investors bigger returns For those that dont like a lot of risk I would consider opening a position once shares regain their footing which we should see soon as shares test the allimportant level Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I
