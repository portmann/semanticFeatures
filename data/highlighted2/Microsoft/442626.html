destinations for watching videos have quietly started using automation to remove extremist content from their sites according to two people familiar with the process The move is a major step forward for internet companies that are eager to eradicate violent propaganda from their sites and are under pressure to do so from governments around the world as attacks by extremists proliferate from Syria to Belgium and the United States YouTube and Facebook are among the sites deploying systems to block or rapidly take down Islamic State videos and other similar material the sources said The technology was originally developed to identify and remove copyrightprotected content on video sites It looks for hashes a type of unique digital fingerprint that internet companies automatically assign to specific videos allowing all content with matching fingerprints to be removed rapidly Such a system would catch attempts to repost content already identified as unacceptable but would not automatically block videos that have not been seen before The companies would not confirm that they are using the method or talk about how it might be employed but numerous people familiar with the technology said that posted videos could be checked against a database of banned content to identify new postings of say a beheading or a lecture inciting violence The two sources would not discuss how much human work goes into reviewing videos identified as matches or nearmatches by the technology They also would not say how videos in the databases were initially identified as extremist Use of the new technology is likely to be refined over time as internet companies continue to discuss the issue internally and with competitors and other interested parties In late April amid pressure from US President Barack Obama and other US and European leaders concerned about online radicalization internet companies including Alphabet Incs YouTube Twitter Inc Facebook Inc and CloudFlare held a call to discuss options including a contentblocking system put forward by the private Counter Extremism Project according to one person on the call and three who were briefed on what was discussed The discussions underscored the central but difficult role some of the worlds most influential companies now play in addressing issues such as terrorism free speech and the lines between government and corporate authority None of the companies at this point has embraced the antiextremist groups system and they have typically been wary of outside intervention in how their sites should be policed Its a little bit different than copyright or child pornography where things are very clearly illegal said Seamus Hughes deputy director of George Washington Universitys Program on Extremism Extremist content exists on a spectrum Hughes said and different web companies draw the line in different places Most have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates their terms of service and many still do Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation The companies now using automation are not publicly discussing it two sources said in part out of concern that terrorists might learn how to manipulate their systems or that repressive regimes might insist the technology be used to censor opponents Theres no upside in these companies talking about it said Matthew Prince chief executive of content distribution company CloudFlare Why would they brag about censorship The two people familiar with the stillevolving industry practice confirmed it to Reuters after the Counter Extremism Project publicly described its contentblocking system for the first time last week and urged the big internet companies to adopt it TheAprilcall was led by Facebooks head of global policy management Monika Bickert sources with knowledge of the call said On it Facebook presented options for discussion according to one participant including the one proposed by the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project The antiextremism group was founded by among others Frances Townsend who advised former president George W Bush on homeland security and Mark Wallace who was deputy campaign manager for the Bush reelection campaign Three sources with knowledge of the April call said that companies expressed wariness of letting an outside group decide what defined unacceptable content Other alternatives raised on the call included establishing a new industrycontrolled nonprofit or expanding an existing industrycontrolled nonprofit All the options discussed involved hashing technology The model for an industryfunded organization might be the nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children which identifies known child pornography images using a system known as PhotoDNA The system is licensed for free by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced in May it was providing funding and technical support to Dartmouth College computer scientist Hany Farid who works with the Counter Extremism Project and helped develop PhotoDNA to develop a technology to help stakeholders identify copies of patently terrorist content Facebooks Bickert agreed with some of the concerns voiced during the call about the Counter Extremism Projects proposal two people familiar with the events said She declined to comment publicly on the call or on Facebooks efforts except to note in a statement that Facebook is exploring with others in industry ways we can collaboratively work to remove content that violates our policies against terrorism In recent weeks one source said Facebook has sent out a survey to other companies soliciting their opinions on different options for industry collaboration on the issue William Fitzgerald a spokesman for Alphabets Google unit which owns YouTube also declined to comment on the call or about the companys automated efforts to police content A Twitter spokesman said the company was still evaluating the Counter Extremism Projects proposal and had not yet taken a position A former Google employee said people there had long debated what else besides thwarting copyright violations or sharing revenue with creators the company should do with its Content ID system Googles system for contentmatching is older and far more sophisticated than Facebooks according to people familiar with both Lisa Monaco senior adviser to the US president on counterterrorismsaid in a statement that the White House welcomed initiatives that seek to help companiesbetter respond to the threat posed by terrorists activities online Reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco and Dustin Volz in Washington
