Consumer electronics is a tough industry characterized by rapid change For most companies product concentration would be a huge negative Risk stemming from Apples concentration on its iPhone franchise is largely mitigated by the ecosystem the smartphone giant has managed to build around its product offerings The firm enjoys durable competitive advantages stemming from scale intangible assets and customer switching costs Apple is beginning to shift to assetlight highmargin middlemen businesses such as the App Store Apple Pay iTunes and Apple Music Not only do these businesses improve cash flow visibility due to their highly recurring nature they serve to further strengthen Apples moat Consumer electronics is a tough industry no doubt about it The industry is characterized by rapid changes courtesy of technology advancements Whats new today might be obsolete within months Consumers also tend to be fickle hopping on and off fads with little regret This is especially so for the mobile phone industry Fundamentally the device itself is unable to command a meaningful degree of customer switching costs Switching to another phone is rather easy one can simply go out and buy one It is hard to succeed in this industry if the phone is all your company has to offer Product concentration would spell the death knell for the firm as soon as consumers decide that its mobile phone is no longer cool Take Motorola for example The companys Razr series of phones was able to appeal to consumers during the mids The V was one of very first phones that adopted a thin profile It was so appealing to consumers that the V became extremely successful selling m units within two years of its introduction and m units within four Motorola tried to capitalize on its virgin success in the mobile phone industry by introducing newer models of the Razr with limited success The company soon faded into obscurity as consumers decided that the phone was not the next big thing anymore Nokia NYSE NOK suffered a similar fate in the lates Risk stemming from Apples concentration in its iPhone franchise is largely mitigated by the ecosystem the smartphone giant has managed to build around its product offerings It is precisely due to nonexistent switching costs that investors are skeptical of the sustainability of success at major smartphone companies such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL It is no secret that Apples nearterm success is highly dependent on its iPhone franchise The franchise has consistently comprised of plus of revenues in recent years and thus it is fair to say that the tech mammoth has serious product concentration However I believe that risks stemming from Apples concentration in its iPhone franchise is largely mitigated by the fact that the company has managed to build an ecosystem around the iPhone Consumers who purchase the iPhone tend to purchase other Apple products such as the iPad the MacBook and more recently the Watch Data is synced across each of these devices through iCloud Further iOS users that purchase media on iTunes are only able to transfer this media over Apple devices they are not portable to other operating systems such as Android with the exception of music As a result consumers who own a number of Apples hardware can switch between devices to suit their needs For example if I merely need to get up to speed regarding my emails I can access them on my Watch If I need to reply to an email I can switch to my iPhone which is easier to type on If I need to make minor edits to a business proposal I can hop on my iPad If I am engaging in workloads that require greater processing power I can switch to my Mac For all my computing needs an Apple device is there to fulfill that need The Mac Watch and iPad have become accessories to the iPhone Apple also has implicitly enticed its user base to adopt more and more of the companys hardware offerings Nearly every single Apple software update mentions how a certain feature cannot only be used on the iPhone but also the Mac and iPad This Im sure is no secret to anyone who owns an iPhone Moreover hardware is just half the story The App Store has served and continues to serve to further strengthen the ecosystem that Apple has built by providing consumers with apps created by developers These apps drastically increase the overall user experience and serve to further heighten the switching costs created by the companys suite of hardware offerings It is due to this ecosystem of offerings that allow the smartphone giant to mitigate risks stemming from product concentration Apple has succeeded where its predecessors and competitors failed Motorola and Nokias value propositions revolved around their phones nothing more These companies focused on selling more phones capitalizing on their initial success Instead they should have diverted some attention to maintaining their user base Once consumers decided to move on to another fad these companies were finished On the other hand Apple has been able to build up a loyal iOS user base largely due to its ecosystem This degree of customer lockin helps insulate the company from changing consumer preferences and technology advancements The firm enjoys durable competitive advantages stemming from scale intangible assets and customer switching costs The curious reader would have realized by now that an ecosystem like the one Apple has is very valuable Thus the next concern one would have is likely to be can competitors replicate the Apple model While possible it is extremely difficult This is because Apple enjoys durable competitive advantages stemming from scale intangible assets and customer switching costs which forms formidable barriers to entry to a potential competitor Developing an ecosystem like the one Apple has does not come cheap Not only does a new entrant need to spend billions in RD Apples RD expense is b annually and continues to grow replicating the companys offerings it also would need to spend a similar amount SGA expense is b annually marketing is likely the bulk of that figure on marketing and advertising its products to consumers If the newcomer develops a product that does not appeal to the majority of consumers it will not sell well Production will be a few million units and the challenger would have to eat RD and marketing costs and will not achieve scale on manufacturing Making unsuccessful smartphones is a good way to lose a lot of money billions in some cases One only needs to look at Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT foray into the industry as an example The Redmond company was late to the party and tried to wow the market with Windows smartphones Alas the phone did not appeal to consumers and the software giant only managed to sell several million units a year Unfazed it proceeded to acquire Nokias handset business Initially I had high hopes for this acquisition see here and here but it appears that I had totally misjudged the barriers to entry in the smartphone industry I stand corrected Anyway the acquisition turned out to be a disaster and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had to write down the billion acquisition a few short years later Considering that even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was unable to gain a meaningful foothold in the market it is not a stretch to say that Apples position is unlikely to be uprooted any time soon the company is here to stay Other competitors such as Samsung OTC SSNLF Xiaomi and Huawei which sell Android smartphones are unprofitable despite commanding the largest market share collectively its unlikely that they would continue to torch money for very long Apart from scale intangible assets also contribute to Apples competitive advantage Most notably Apples brand name is extremely valuable In order for the reader to understand why I think Apples brand is very valuable especially in the consumer electronics industry I believe that an explanation on brand value is required Brands are only valuable to companies if they do one of two things or both but those cases tend to be very rare Having a wellknown brand is not good enough Think about it Everyone knows Sony NYSE SNE However would you pay more for a Sony DVD player A brand may be wellknown but being famous is useless to the company if its consumers are unwilling to pay a premium for its products Apple has consistently been able to raise ASPs of its iPhones even in the face of currency headwinds The company has tried to offset currency translation by increasing the price of its products and it has largely worked out To the best of my knowledge the iPhone continues to sell very well per recent quarter commentary even with price hikes illustrating that Apple is able to retain its customer base despite higher ASPs I do not believe that Apples brand reduces search costs significantly and hence I will not elaborate further on the topic As for customer switching costs I have already explained in a prior section how the companys ecosystem ensures a high degree of customer lockin I believe that point requires no further explanation Thus I will focus on the durability of that customer stickiness An argument that bears like to raise against Apple is that Androids user base is twice that of Apples Androids user base is b while Apples user base is m However iOS users spend x that of Google Play NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL users Hence to a developer looking to choose which platform to build his apps on iOS is a nobrainer it is where the money is It is not a stretch to assert that the App Store is a major reason why consumers turn to the iPhone it sure was true in my case Therefore as iOS users spend way more than their Android counterparts developers are likely to migrate to iOS if they havent already and develop their apps further strengthening the Apple ecosystem and increasing customer stickiness Furthermore Apple has always targeted the affluent market and this is unlikely to change the company has not ventured into the lowend for many years Thus this leads to a virtuous cycle developers migrate to iOS to create apps for affluent users who pay for them further incentivizing developers to create more apps augmenting customer lockin Apple is beginning to shift to assetlight highmargin middlemen businesses such as the App Store Apple Pay iTunes and Apple Music We have established a couple of things Apple has managed to build an ecosystem around its product offerings and maintain a sizable user base And the financial benefits stemming from the above is likely to accrue for the foreseeable future thanks to the smartphone giants durable competitive advantages At this point the reader should have no doubt that one of the major reasons for Apples success is its ability to keep its customers within the Apple ecosystem It follows that anything that the company does to ensure that its customers remain in its ecosystem is likely to be hugely beneficial Apple is beginning to shift resources to ancillary businesses such as the App Store Apple Pay iTunes and Apple Music These businesses are all integrated into the ecosystem and therefore increased use of these products by consumers will be instrumental to the companys future success Not only do these businesses strengthen the companys ecosystem I believe that they also will play a huge role in the companys profitability in years to come This is because these businesses are middlemen businesses which are characterized by assetlight operating models and high margins at scale It is in these businesses that Apple does not produce hardware As a result it follows that margins on these offerings are likely to be far greater than that of the hardware segments Although revenues from these segments are minimal they comprised of of sales per data their contribution to profit is likely to be outsized due to their favorable economics compared to that of the hardware business In the App Store Apple does not make apps the developers do Apple simply skims of the revenue generated from these apps The smartphone giants only significant cost is that of payment processing storagedelivery costs are largely negligible due to small app sizes Initially Apple broke even on the App Store in probably due to the high fixedcost portion of credit card processing fees However in recent years users have executed larger and larger inapp purchase transactions A study by Wi found that of inapp purchases were between meaning that Apples economics on the App Store is trending very favorably Keep in mind that this was in current percentages are likely to be greater Apple adopts a similar middleman model with iTunes As a result I suspect that a bulk of Apples b in revenue for its iTunes segment is pure profit The contribution to overall profit is quite astounding if one considers that Apple made b in gross profit in and nearly b in net profit For every thousand songs streamed on Apple Music Apple will be down However the key thing to note is that this figure is largely fixed although future negotiations might change things With a largely fixed cost base the model is highly scalable Note that Apple does not produce the music and therefore avoids the costs associated with music production As for Apple Pay Cupertino is to receive cents for every transaction Costs seem minimal here as well considering that Apple is working with existing payment processing such as Visa NYSE V I suspect the credit card company would be bearing a majority of the costs associated with processing payments At scale Apple Music and Apple Pay are likely to achieve extremely high margins and contribute significantly to Apples bottom line Not only do these businesses provide cash flow visibility as they tend to be recurring in nature provided that Apple is able to maintain or grow its user base which it has for the most part they serve to further strengthen Apples moat by augmenting its ecosystem In conclusion Apple has managed to build up a sizable and loyal iOS user base while avoiding the common pitfalls product concentration that mobile phone companies often face see Motorola and Nokia by ensuring a high degree of customer lockin through the provision of an ecosystem This ecosystem is likely to be durable due to the numerous competitive advantages that the company possesses stemming from scale intangible assets and switching costs The company is beginning to shift to assetlight highmargin middlemen businesses which will not only be wildly profitable at scale and contribute significantly to the companys bottom line but also will serve to strengthen the overall ecosystem Without a doubt Apple is a wonderful business and should continue to be so in the future Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks Source Apple The
