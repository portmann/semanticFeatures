the highest it has been in a decade Reason being the market is anticipating a sharp rise in EPS over the next months However its more than likely the market will not bid up the stock any further waiting to see what analysts think the company will do next year As a result even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues to do well the stock at current prices is too juicy for any further runup One reason is if there is a fundamental change in the company and you expect its stock price to deteriorate as a result Another reason might be if growth metrics have changed For the most part current stock prices reflect future growth prospects Many times investors fixate on the past disregard what might happen in the future and continue to hold their position and find themselves with a position that either underperforms or loses money Another reason is because a stock has run ahead of itself While growth current profits and future prospects might still be intact many times the market rushes ahead of itself and bids up a stock more than warranted In most cases such a stock underperforms or produces losses for investors in the future even if nothing fundamental has changed with the company In Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT case the last two paragraphs are what will determine the future trajectory of its stock While there was a lot of fanfare from analysts as a result of MSFTs current quarterly results what is important to notice is that growth has been derailed Please notice that revenue for FY Q was down significantly yy as was FY Q and FY Q on a yy basis In fact MSFTs revenue for FY Q is not significantly higher than what it was at the end of MSFT is one of the most followed stocks around As a result it is also one of the most heavily covered stocks by analysts And while MSFT does surprise us here and there for the most part analysts get it right on a revenue basis at least So if we look at what analysts think MSFT will do in the future the stocks growth prospects are not that rosy According to the consensus data from yahoocom analysts believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will book about billion in revenue for the quarter ending March yy growth and about billion the quarter after that yy growth with revenue for the entire year coming in at about billion which is negative to the tune of To be fair however analysts do see growth for FY by about Also to be fair while the current trailing PE of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is about the month forward PE falls to about So analysts expect a big rise in EPS even if revenue does not rise as much Reason being Microsofts product mix is changing The company is gaining ground in the cloud space it is more involved in making and selling its own hardware and is also in the gaming space All these activities are of higher added value than the product mix the company had several of years ago However the question remains by keeping your position and holding the stock will you see much in capital gains over the next months or so I think not even if the company is performing quite well Now remember markets are forward looking and are future discount mechanisms Especially for stocks like MSFT where the entire analyst community is able to come very close to predicting what will happen in the future most if not all of MSFTs future activity is baked in the stock already MSFT is at its highest in a decade Like I said the market expects MSFTs EPS to increase considerably over the next months therefore it is bidding up the stock and discounting the stocks value today However unless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can replicate this increase in EPS over the next to months chances are its PE will not be much above that Also the PE of MSFT over the past decade has been between and about not counting the current rise over the last years or so So in other words MSFTs multiple will not be this high forever If this years rise in EPS will not be replicated next year chances are the PE will fall a lot as a result although not unnecessarily the price of Microsofts stock Then again there is another reason to hold on to MSFT and that is a shrinking float right As you can see from the above chart even a shrinking float has not prevented the stock from trading at a PE ratio far below of what it is trading today In my opinion a shrinking float cannot save any stock when it is overpriced And that is the case today with MSFT My guess is investors in Microsofts stock have at least months of dead money ahead of them Unless we get some insight as to how the company will perform over a month horizon and I for one do not have such insight I think the market will wait to see what analysts think MSFT might do next year and then decide to bid up the stock or not In the meantime however the stock will probably go a little up and a little down but not really doing much as it is killing time so the stock price can catch up to the fundamentals No I do not think MSFT can fall by a lot unless we get a major market correction however I do not think it will do much of anything for at least the next months If thats okay with you continue to hold the stock If not and you think you might do better buying something else sell MSFT today and wait for at least months and reevaluate the situation then Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
