GOOG MSFT and more in the fight against TLPS A wide range of wireless stakeholders now recognizes TLPS as bad technology and bad policy Today a whos who of important and influential stakeholders in the wireless industry are coming together publicly to voice their opposition to Globalstars NYSEMKT GSAT proposed Terrestrial Low Power Service TLPS a concept once touted by Globalstar as the only solution to a dire WiFi spectrum crisis but now increasingly recognized by a broad and growing range of observers as bad technology and bad public policy Details for the event are available here Even Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT rivals in businesses like search have joined forces to highlight TLPSs shortcomings not just the interference risks it poses to other users of the GHz band but the ugly precedent it would set in granting a single private party de facto control over public spectrum Todays event organized by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and the nonprofit Open Technology Institute and hosted at Microsofts Innovation Policy Center in Washington DC will include the following experts From <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Michael Daum technology policy strategist From the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association a strong and respected advocate for rural broadband access Vice President Alex Phillips a member of the FCCs Consumer Advisory Committee From the WiFi Alliance the key WiFi industry group Russell Fox counsel From the National Cable Telecommunications Association the leading trade group for cable companies Paul Caritj counsel and From the Open Technology Institute a nonprofit think tank focused on freedom and justice in the digital age Michael Calabrese a member of the US Department of Commerces Spectrum Management Advisory Committee and former member of the presidents spectrum reform working group in Each of these participants has voiced concern about Globalstars TLPS proposal in FCC filings Googles filing is available here and Microsofts here WISPAs latest filing is here the WiFi Alliances latest filing is here and NCTAs is here The Open Technology Institute has filed criticism here here and here The opposition to TLPS does not fall along conventional partisan or factional lines While groups like the Open Technology Institute and the cable industry were at loggerheads over net neutrality they agree on the problems with TLPS Likewise the predominantly ruralfocused members of WISPA have historically had a strong ally in Ajit Pai one of the Republican FCC commissioners while unlicensed interest groups including the WiFi Alliance have often benefited from the support of Jessica Rosenworcel one of the Democratic commissioners yet they all see eye to eye on TLPS Globalstar by contrast has no strong allies in keeping with its failure to offer any meaningful benefit to the public It simply wants special regulatory treatment in a lastgasp bid to keep its failed business afloat and the wireless community is increasingly seeing its selfinterested spin for what it is Since making our Globalstar short position public we have always maintained that the stock is worthless even if the FCC authorizes TLPS Thus we did not fear the possibility of a nearterm approval But given how intense the opposition to TLPS has grown and how stubbornly Globalstar has refused to offer even a hint of a compromise we now consider a flat rejection of TLPS a very real possibility Without the benefit of postapproval hype over TLPS it will be hard to prolong Globalstars survival much longer Globalstar supporters once contended that Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and big cable companies were among the most likely bidders in what they dreamed would be a frenzied private auction of Globalstars spectrum now that all three have put TLPSs very existence in serious jeopardy with their strong opposition that narrative always in truth ridiculous is shattered beyond repair While some shareholders console themselves with the fantasy that all this opposition must mean that TLPS is somehow a threat to the tech giants and thus very valuable the reality is that a paid exclusive WiFi channel would have no effect on anyones business model unless its deployment got far enough to cause harmful interference Otherwise how exactly would an exclusive WiFi channel reduce Google or Microsofts profits Indeed if TLPS were anything like what Globalstars hype portrays it to be a massive boost to WiFi capacity and the cure to a devastating congestion epidemic then all of these organizations would be eager to support it The fact that they are not further discredits Globalstars case The efforts of the WiFi Alliance WISPA Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and others have nothing to do with fears of competition in the case of a nonprofit group like the Open Technology Institute the very concept is meaningless and everything to do with the longterm downsides of sacrificing public spectrum to private entities in exchange for nothing of value We hope that todays event will draw more attention to the true nature of TLPS and further demonstrate how out of touch and isolated Globalstar really is Source Globalstar Wireless
