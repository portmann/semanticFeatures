tablet uses the new nanometer Atom xZ processor The Samsung Chopin LTE Android tablet has GB of RAM which should make it great for multitasking and gaming Samsung is still the worlds top vendor of Android tablets and smartphones Intel is wise to try and win the full backing of Samsung A benchmark test result on Primate Labs Geekbench page revealed that Samsung OTCSSNLF has an Android tablet with an Intel NASDAQ INTC Cherry Trail Atom xZ processor The Samsung Chopin LTE Android tablet also comes with around GB of RAM which convinces me that it will be a premium tablet that could compete with Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPad Air The impressive Geekbench benchmark scores of the Samsung Chopin LTE tablet is on par with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Surface Windows tablet which uses an Intel Atom xZ processor and GB of RAM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Samsung are now imitating the example set first by ASUSTeKs OTCASUUY use of GB RAM inside an Android phablet I expect Nokia NYSE NOK to also release a more expensive GB RAM and Intel Cherry Atom x version of its amazing N Android tablet After a successful debut in China Nokia is now selling the Intel Atom BayTrailpowered GB RAMequipped N tablet for in Taiwan The support of Samsung is a very important future tailwind for Intels new Cherry Trail mobile application processors Samsung remains the top vendor of Android tablets The company managed to sell million tablets during the Q period Samsung Android tablets greatly outsell the competing Android tablets from Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY and ASUSTeK During the Q period Lenovo only managed to sell million tablets while Asus sold million Samsung is therefore Intels best hope for its new nanometer Cherry Trail tablet application processors Avast has confirmed that ASUSTeKs upcoming ZenPad tablets will come preinstalled with Avasts Mobile Security app and will also use the Atom x processor However the ZenPad Android tablet might just be another product that will receive a per unit subsidy from Intel The premium vibe of the Samsung Chopin LTE and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface compels me to believe that Intel wont be subsidizing them Samsung has the marketing budget to theoretically sell million to million units of Intel Atom xpowered Android or Windows tablets annually Intels huge operating losses on its mobile chips could go down if Samsung really releases a or Intelpowered tablet that will compete with the iPad Air and Surface Instead of subsiding million cheap Atom xpowered Android tablets with each Intel will likely gain or more for every premium tablet that Samsung and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will sell The bigger picture also includes the possibility of Samsung countering the global threat of the Asus ZenFone with a Galaxy phone also equipped an Intel Atom Cherry Trail processor and GB of RAM The Samsung Galaxy A phablet uses the overheating Snapdragon octacore processor from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM It is high time for Samsung to also try the nonoverheating Intel Bay Trail Atom Z SoC used by Asus for the ZenFone Samsung is still the runaway leader in smartphone shipments Unfortunately overheating issues on some midrange Galaxy smartphones is bad for the companys reputation The potential benefit of Intelpowered smartphones from Samsung is substantial If we use TrendForces data Samsung shipped out more than million smartphones during the first three months of Asus is confident of selling million ZenFone handsets this year However Samsung has a much bigger advertising budget wider carrier support and a vast global distribution channel than Asus Samsung could also deliver at least million Intel Atompowered smartphones Samsungs decision to try the Atom xZ SoC for its Chopin LTE Android tablet could lead to the company also using x Atom mobile processors for some future Galaxy smartphones The total addressable market of smartphone processors is much bigger than that of tablet processors According to IDCs latest quarterly report the smartphone remains the fastestgrowing category until Smartphone sales have a year CAGR of twice higher than that of tabletsins INTC is a Buy The company is gaining wider industry support for its x Atom mobile processors and yet it still has lower PE PS and PB ratios than its peers in the Technology sector and the Semiconductor industry Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a
