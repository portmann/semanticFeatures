class='textDiv'>Heres The Real Reason Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Moved Higher After Earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Understanding why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>moved higher following earnings is a bit of a mystery but I think I know why For the most part the outlook wasnt particularly phenomenal in terms of constant currency But if you look further out theres meaningful growth potential due to commercial revenues However its not just commercial revenues the XboxSurfaceSkypeAdvertising product segments are starting to grow into larger businesses which impacts more of the revenue mix going forward So if you combine all of these factors it seems the outlook was actually conservative and its particularly hard to make an accurate forecast on nextyear sales I anticipate that commercial subscriptions will convert into a higher percentage of office users paired with high growth segments impacting consolidated sales more substantially in FY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT remains one of my more favorite ideas and this is mostly driven by the fact that the company is well managed and is transitioning into a growth phase Of course anyone can acknowledge that Microsofts presence in mobile hasnt actually been very convincing However the company has been able to demonstrate that it can continue to grow its presence in the enterprise Office revenue in commercial was up in constant currency dynamics and cloud services revenue grew constant currency and office consumer grew by around million subscribers in the past quarter The decline was due to the transition from license to subscription revenue On the frontend the consumer office segment will experience a moderate drop in revenue but over time I anticipate that the annual subscription will cumulate into larger revenue over time Furthermore many people gain access to Office via an office computer so the momentum in the commercial segment seems more indicative of the overall growth potential of office I dont see many people going out and buying Office Suite software when they really dont need it unless if its for school or they like to work at home Of course many companies and universities provide free Office Licenses on home computers for employeesstudents so this is where the line becomes a little gray But overall productivity software is expected to grow considerably over the next three years Now if youre wondering why Im so fixated on Office revenue its because its the largest contributing revenue category followed by server related licensing infrastructure and middleware Anyone fixated on the PC and Phone space when reviewing Microsofts results is really missing the big picture here as the company illustrates in its recently published annual report that across key product categories theyve made some pretty decent progress Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a massive organization so its important to understand that the company operates on multiple pillars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt really concentrated in a particular space so the industryspecific problems pertaining to PCs wont substantially impact the rest of the company I usually refer to this breakdown because its really hard to understand the growth of the various product segments as you go through the fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>tends to break down by segment in a really awkward format But for those of you who are pretty growth oriented its important to point out that the Windows PC segment was what really suffered in the past year And the Office revenue is going through a mix shift transition away from perpetual licensing to subscription revenue The revenue is deferred for Office so you have to imagine that it takes time for there to be a meaningful uptake in sales on a quarterbyquarter basis The point is the total subscriber figure growth is more indicative of the consolidated revenue growth going forward as this particular segment could generate growth yearoveryear and the impact on consolidated revenue growth is or so and thats just one product category Now obviously handset sales were particularly weak in the prior quarter but what really stood out was the revenue outlook in Q CY which is Q FY The company mentions that in the holiday quarter the best case scenario is billion in terms of sales with worstcase scenario at billion For the most part my bias is to the upside due to seasonality and refresh in the PC segment However theres no denying that the consensus estimate from analysts sits in the middle and that sales are projected to decline by mostly due to foreign exchange impact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>mentions in its outlook that the revenue impact is likely to be around due to FX However if you factor back in that youre looking at around flat sales for the next quarter in terms of constant currency That implies a flat yearoveryear outlook What really stood out following earnings was the sudden move higher Its really hard to understand why people are so optimistic after management guided flat revenue when compared to prior year comps You would imagine that these numbers arent that good but Ive seen this play out over the past couple years with Adobe Systems NASDAQ ADBE where revenue ramps substantially once they transition more of their users over to subscription over software licenses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>thinks that over time the transition will generate x more in revenues per user and that user growth will continue due to the broader demand for productivity software in various markets In other words the market seems a lot more forwardlooking when pertaining very specifically to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and thats whats surprising to me because markets are usually short sighted My guess is that the various industrywide reports surfacing on the eventual bottom of semiconductors in Q CY and the ramp up of software subscriptions is whats driving the optimism Theres also no denying that console gaming revenues should be up significantly in Q CY due to Halo and that the remaining segments like advertising and Surface will leap out at us eventually The growth in Surface between and was and Im not saying that tripledigit growth will happen again this year Its just that in my view the revenue growth of a billion segment could be the real surprise to sales in the next quarter as their consumer electronic franchise is starting to gain legs and is moving meaningful volume off the shelves So if the big businesses are set to stabilize or grow modestly over the course of three years the high growth categories like Skype Azure and Surface are set to contribute perhaps an incremental improvement of to billion to consolidated sales which more than offsets the weakness in PCs which is expected to bottom out anyway The end takeaway is that there are a lot of moving parts at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>right now You have substantial growth priced into the stock judging by its valuation x EPS However the causal relationship for that valuation seems substantiated due to notable strength in the smaller business segments paired with a major sales catalyst once Office commercial licenses completely convert over to subscription With those two factors combined the question then becomes when do sales grow significantly Obviously management is being pretty conservative here with their guidance but thats obviously due to their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders Anyone who simply breaks it down into these various segments will recognize that theres a lot of pentup upside And Im not saying it happens next quarter but eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should be able to report a fairly sizable improvement in sales and earnings over the next year or two Its just not yet clear when the smaller segment will grow into a large enough of a base to impact the remaining segments And finally its not yet clear when PCs do eventually bottom out But if all the stars do align which I think they will it will continue to outperform and the earnings multiple will eventually stabilize Ive been optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for quite a while Going forward I plan to elaborate more on the valuation I think it will trade at and provide my own estimates on salesearnings in future articles Thanks for reading We only
