PowerShares FTSE RAFI US SmallMid Portfolio NASDAQ PRFZ is our worst rated All Cap Blend ETF and World Funds B Riley Diversified Equity Fund MUTF BRDAX is our worst rated All Cap Blend mutual fund PRFZ earns a Dangerous rating and BRDAX earns a Very Dangerous rating One of the worst stocks held by All Cap Blend funds is Callidus Software NASDAQ CALD The company has failed to earn a positive NOPAT since and the companys ROIC is also very disappointing at This number means that the company is losing cents for every dollar that is invested into it As such CALD earns our Very Dangerous rating To justify its current price of share Callidus would have to achieve positive margins and grow revenues by compounded annually for the next years Seeing as the company has only grown revenue by compounded annually for the past three years while generating losses it seems unlikely the company could sustain higher levels of growth and suddenly become profitable for nearly three decades Sources
