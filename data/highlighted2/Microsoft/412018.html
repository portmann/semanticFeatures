style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>paid billion to acquire Mojang in Bringing the addictive gameplay of Minecraft to China can notably increase this games contribution to Microsofts coffers It is estimated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is selling copies of Minecraft every day Mojang sells one PC version license of Minecraft for The Xbox and PlayStation versions sell for to If we take a median price of and multiply it by k we can guesstimate that Minecrafts monthly sales from PCConsoles is only million As per SensorTowers April estimates the Minecraft Pocket Edition iOSAndroid versions posted net global sales of million cut of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL were already deducted The freemium Minecraft Story Mode mobile game also had net sales of million last April All in all Minecrafts monthly contribution to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is million or millionyear Staying out of Chinas growing gaming industry means it would take many years before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could recover its billion investment in Mojang Having such a massive population of citizens is no doubt helping China become a very important market for video games As per Newzoos most recent report China will overthrow the US this year to become the biggest market for video games Please study the chart below For this year Chinas games market will be worth billion topping the billion of the US games industry Mojangs partnership with NetEase is key toward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>profiting from the spending habits of more than million Chinese gamers The deal with NetEase may grow beyond just the PC and mobile versions of Minecraft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Studios used to be a prolific publisher of PC games It might become active again just to exploit Chinas gaming industry Furthermore Chinas video games market will post a CAGR until This also makes China the fastest growing market for traditional video and mobile games Newzoos estimates could also be lower than what the future will really bring Let us not forget that Chinas government has eliminated restrictions over the sales and manufacture of video game consoles Bringing the joy of the Kinectpowered Xbox One to Chinese living rooms could only increase the population of gamers there By expanding Minecraft to China Mojang could see monthly sales shoot up by as much as Minecraft is not a digital version Lego It is far more advanced The unique learningfocused gameplay of Minecraft is going to be a massive hit among Chinese people China is full of kids that will love the creative thinkingfocus of Minecraft As an Asian parent I am strongly in favor of video games that improve the computational thinking of my daughter Teachers and parents have been using Minecraft to educate children Youth Digital a firm focused on

games in China Theres intense competition between these two Chinese giants Tencent has recently tapped Intels NASDAQ INTC help to create its own gaming console We cannot discount the future likelihood that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might also come up with a Chinaspecific game console for NetEase The threat to NeatEase is that Tencents lead in gamesrelated revenue will only increase once it starts selling its Windows powered TGP Box console <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and NetEase could easily come up with a Windows game console product Having its own gaming console will allow NetEase to optimize Minecraft and its other games Keeping the loyalty of NetEase customers requires giving them a bestinclass gaming experience I like the business of selling video games Its very satisfying to me to make real money out of selling virtual products There are potential longterm benefits if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will only try and become the biggest games publisher on the planet Newzoos estimate of billion for s global video game sales tells me that it is an industry much bigger than the business of
