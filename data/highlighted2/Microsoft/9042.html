make a ton of money How Apple Whole Foods were perfect examples I often make the mistake of being an armchair investor That is just sitting at my desk reading filings and believing I understood the business But today Im going to look at the flipside When its okay to be an armchair investor With many small cap stocks you need to put in the extra effort because there isnt as much information available Many small caps are underfollowed misunderstood had solvable issues and cheap These are the stocks where you can get One Up On Wall Street But for blue chips its never under followed and rarely misunderstood The minute something happens you will be one of the last to know If you have special insight thats called insider trading Otherwise its already been analyzed scrutinized and argued to death Thats why when I invest in a company like Apple NASDAQ AAPL or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT I dont bother trying to predict what the next product will be Who cares what screen size the iPhone will be This is one of the times where its okay to be an armchair investor Its better than spending days or weeks trying to find information about whether sapphire crystal or Corning glass is better After all does it really matter When investment articles talk about things like the future of K screens and how Apple will be the leader I take it as noise because its not just Apple that will benefit The entire industry will get a lift from such technology Ultimately with blue chips the only two avenues you can focus on is finding companies with Take a look at BP NYSE BP after the oil spill fiasco If you had iron guts and managed to tune out the noise this turned out to be a great investment The Japan tsunami in was horrific and I pray that something like this never happens to any country But there was opportunity amidst the disaster with Tokyo Electric OTCPK TKECF A crisis opportunity is a terrible opportunity to waste You have to spot the fixable problems BP was a fixable solution as an investment The environment from the spill and tsunami are still impacted but for the companies they are fixable issues Back to Big Solvable Issues and Cheapness The only two avenues you can focus on is finding companies with Both and end up pointing to valuation Your only edge with large cap stocks is the price you pay A great investment opportunity occurs when a marvelous business encounters a onetime huge but solvable problem The biggest stock I own at the moment is Apple and when I started writing about Why Apple Wasnt Worth pre split I just focused on the fundamentals and valuation I still hold Apple and its currently my biggest holding Im not selling anytime soon when I focus on the fundamentals and the tailwinds it is riding on Right now I see that Apples intrinsic value is around And today Im pleased to say that both and has disappeared for Apple simply by ignoring the noise that surrounds the company When I started buying Whole Foods NASDAQ WFM it was a carbon copy of the situation Apple was in Perceptions around Whole Foods was down Pessimism was at a high and the stock was at a week low But short months later things started to turn around and heres my full thoughts and analysis on what Whole Foods is worth today Thats a big range but the growing demand in the organic food business is strong and now that Wall Street has realized its mistake the stock is being pushed up Note that in my analysis I tried to eliminate as much noise as possible Its easy to over emphasize and base an investment idea on a point that you realize isnt important to begin with Been there done that You Have Zero Edge for Large Caps Except for One Thing Valuation valuation valuation Let the market dance foolishly over things that dont matter in the long term All I know is that the best investors like Warren Buffett Ben Graham Monish Pabrai Bill Ackman and Francis Chou got to where they are by looking for temporary fear and solvable issues and loading the truck at cheap prices The only thing you can control of the time is the price you pay Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that
