Three Year Bailout Yves Smith Yves here As readers may know I started up and ran an MA department for Sumitomo Bank then the second biggest bank in the world at a time when both the MA market and Japan were hot as in this looked more sensible at the time than it might with the benefit of hindsight Part of my job wound up being protecting the bank who was lending to these deals and the clients from doing things that were stupid That was an enormously uphill task since Japan was not and I assume still is not a contractual society It was just about impossible to get domestic Japanese companies to understand that the only thing that mattered was what was in the deal documents and not all the blather from the seller and his various minions But this wasnt the way to maximize fees which was something the bank was also keenly interested in An American client of mine pulled me aside and said You have to quit caring that the deals make sense It puts you at a competitive disadvantage Everything can be solved by price Get the buyers price expectations up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>illustrates the realworld fallout of letting corporate executives either out of desperation or out of finding deal making more fun than the grind of making businesses perform better follow the siren song of MA mavens By Wolf Richter a San Francisco based executive entrepreneur start up specialist and author with extensive international work experience Originally published at Wolf Street As the MA boom in the US explodes from record to record with one megamerger succeeding another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>clarified on Wednesdayjust how much all this fun costs down the road in jobs and dollars relating mostly to its acquisition of Nokia it announced a second wave of layoffs writeoffs and shutdowns Share repurchases MA layoffs and costcutting are easier to make happen for a CEO than inventing things and boosting sales organically which is really hard Companies call the dizzying costs of acquisitions paid for with cash andor stock noncash charges to make them appear irrelevant Analysts feed out of their hands and eat itup To justify acquisitions CEOs and analysts sprinkle their pronouncements with terms like efficiencies and synergies that are euphemisms for costcutting destruction of productive capacity and layoffs In September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>acquired Nokias mobilephone business and patents Nokia was junkrated Its market share was collapsing It had lost over billion in the prior year But its marginalized smartphones were using the Windows Phones operating system that no one else of consequence was using And that was a big deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>paid billion To make the deal sound palatable it promised million in annual cost savings the efficiencies and synergies within months That was CEO Steve Ballmers doing In February Satya Nadella was anointed CEO On July the meaning of annual cost savings became clear the company would axe people and take a billion noncash charge And in premarket trading after the announcement of the job cuts shares rose to a year high Nadella was putting his stamp on the company Almost exactly a year later this Wednesday he sent an email to employees to update them on decisions impacting our phone business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would axe another people globally nearly of its already trimmeddown workforce primarily in our phone business as Nadella wrote He expected it to happen over the next several months And a huge pile of money has gone up in smoke Today we announced a fundamental restructuring of our phone business As a result the company will take an impairment charge of approximately billion related to assets associated with the acquisition of the Nokia Devices and Services business in addition to a restructuring charge of approximately million to million In an email to employees in late June quoted by the New York Times Nadella tried to get his employees all excited about the future by warning them that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would have to make some tough choices in areas where things are not working and solve hard problems in ways that drive customer value People could imagine what was coming And it wasnt reassuring We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem that includes our firstparty device family In the near term we will run a more effective phone portfolio with better products and speed to market given the recently formed Windows and Devices Group We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software Well bring business customers the best management security and productivity experiences they need value phone buyers the communications services they want and Windows fans the flagship devices theyll love Beyond the insufferable corporate speak The standalone business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bought for billion a year and a half ago would essentiallybe shut down The costs are ballooning The tab for the Nokia acquisition and some other moves with both waves combined now lists jobs axed and billion down the drain Thats how MAs work Theyre the ultimate form of financial engineeringRarely does anything goodcome of them that moves the economy or even the companyforward Instead theyentail layoffs writeoffs shutdowns and economic decline In some cases they generate oligopolies that then can exert pricing power and stifle innovation which further degrade the economy But there are some benefits The executives of the acquired companies get a fancy package The executives of the acquirerfatten up their corporations and thus their own fancy packageAcquisitions are great deals for insiders and the stockholders of the acquired companies But somebody has got to pay for it As in Microsofts case there is a long lag between the acquisition announcement and whentheefficiencies and synergies start wreaking havoc on thebroader economy Despite the acquisition Windows Phones has a miserable or soof the smartphone market not even an alsoran next to Apples iOS and Googles AndroidFormer Nokia CEO Stephen Elop who transferred to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>with Nokia is already gone after having been richly rewarded via among other methods the acquisition And Ballmer retired shortly after the acquisition and bought the Los Angeles Clippers for billion The current MA Boom the biggest ever is far bigger than the last two and they both ended in crashes Read Everyone Is Wondering When the Volcano Will Erupt This entry was posted in Banking
