Alpha Two years ago when i suggested MSFT and AAPL as income equities many were skeptical Today both are showing up in many income portfolios Myopic analysts have focused on the LinkedIn acquisition resulting in a current price below fair value Subscribers to Income From Covered Option Writing had an advance look at this material Myopia nearsightedness is a simple medical condition I invented the concept of the Myopic Analyst to identify the risk of short sightedness and narrow focus in investing My series introduction from provides the following caution about such short sighted analysis Myopia is a dangerous condition It makes people blind to the reality around them They flounder about navigating on the basis of where they think they remember things should be instead of living in the present environment Beyond visual myopia narrowminded thinking is even more dangerous when navigating the changing financial landscape For your own financial health beware of Myopic Analyst Syndrome <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT began the week by announcing the acquisition of LinkedIn NYSE LNKD for billion This represents an expenditure of about in MSFT assets per share Displeased Myopic Analysts were quick to question the value of this deal Shares plunged to after having traded at the prior Friday This three dollar drop negates the entire value of that billion Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really worth billion less today than it was last Friday The answer is a resounding no Myopic analysts have gotten it wrong yet again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares are largely priced by income investors attracted to its safe dividends The value of shares is primarily set by what income investors are willing to pay for that income stream Yield rate This creates an opportunity for bargain savvy income investors today My case is presented below Two years ago my article Apple And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Share A Dirty Little Secret posited that MSFT has become a safe and reliable dividend income equity with its share price largely driven by income investors seeking its quarterly distributions Application of YDP Analysis Appraisa l provides fair value computed for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at its dividend distribution levels for each of the last years Results shown on the chart below overlain on the actual trading prices confirms MSFT to largely be driven by the market price correlation to dividend distributions in accord with YDP modeling In fact share price tends to oscillate around the YDP fair value calculation with noise created by secondary pushes and pulls of both the micro and macro economic environments for the company The center focus of the YDP fair value and trend to always return to YDP value exposes these secondary departures to be misdirected myopia by analysts out of touch with what really drives investor interest and shareholder value A focus on YDP fair value is sufficient to reliably use for value investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or any true dividend income equity At the current market price of shares are below fair value A dividend increase of perhaps to a total of per annum can be expected November This would bring fair value to above current market trading price Note YDP fair value has been computed using actual dividends and a projected hike consistent with the year dividend growth rate Historical yield rate is a very low volatility trend as seen on the chart below Of course dividend income is only safe if it is reliable going forward Therefore a check on the health and sustainability to generate those dividends is important A look at cash dividend payout ratio shows a sharp rise since but still a very comfortable Even with additional debt service for the LinkedIn purchase Free cash flow can be expected to easily cover dividends and dividend growth for many years to come Probing deeper a look at company health and sustainability provides a bit more disturbing picture Free cash flow the life blood of dividends has remained fairly steady for the past years All other important health and sustainability metrics have been in marked decline Although there is no near term risk to the dividend from them both due to current coverage ratios and huge cash reserves these long term trends will need to be reversed to keep this income investment viable as a cash cow beyond the next years Will management be up to the task of restoring long term health and sustainability A look at management effectiveness leaves a lot of room for doubt All measures other than FCF show steady declines for the past years indicating management is ineffective at allocating resources to enhance and protect shareholder value in the long run I believe a new management team both executive and operating will be needed before the long term ability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to grow and transform to a true st century company can be achieved None the less with adequate cash flow along with a pile of cash to backstop it the dividends that investors are pricing shares for are secure for at least years prior to triggering any potential concerns beginning Todays strategy is acquire the shares for current bargain prices and income along with a capital appreciation likely over the next to months driven by price correlation to dividend distributions mediated by the historical yield rate trend Keep an eye on cash flow metrics to sustain dividends and turn around by management either the current team or a new one Given the current lackluster performance of the existing team and a strong pile of cash to aid realignment and restore health I predict an activist investor will be attracted soon Any such move will probably immediately boost share prices well above current YDP fair value which is dictated by the dividend income stream alone With shares trading below fair value it is a good time to enter or own MSFT For those wanting an entry I suggest a buywrite at market and using the covered call leg on the day premium for a net debit of This provides an absolute gain of annualized yield rate and allows you to start capturing dividends with the distribution The combined option boost and dividends give an annualized yield rate of In the event of callaway the intrinsic gain of adds an additional absolute gain annualized yield rate If you find
