Historically channel distribution has been reserved for the most expensive software and hardware IBM NYSE IBM Intel NASDAQ INTC Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and their kin generate more than of their revenues

at Dropbox Recently I had an opportunity to chat with Thomas about his experiences and I asked him to write about SMB SaaS channel distribution for this blog because his perspective on the opportunity is unique After all hes built the most success SMB SaaS channel ever Thank you Thomas for sharing your insights The Channel Distribution Opportunity by Thomas Hansen Modern companies are born in the cloud and independence is in their DNA Many start by following selfservice distribution models as a route to market which have served as the de facto standard for helping cloud businesses grow With customers coming to their virtual doorstep these cloud companies are free to scale at their own pace expanding sales and their reach in the marketplace But sometimes that independence comes at a cost an opportunity cost With a selfservice model customers who have more specific needs are left in the cold As a result the next step for cloud companies is generally to build their own outbound and inbound sales force as a way to foster and manage relationships with customers This presents its own challenges as it typically is resource intensive and at least initially has unit economics that at best is challenging At this stage many executives ask themselves Is there a more efficient way to reach customers The answer is not that obvious but there is a better way There are approximately million businesses worldwide that are supported by a reseller ecosystem consisting of half a million reseller companies These resellers in turn employ literally millions of sellers each effectively operating as an outsourced sales team for the cloud companies they service Cloud software vendors that operate through partners in the channel are in a position to reach far more markets than they would on their own and at a much faster pace And while turning to channel resellers may seem decidedly oldschool working with partners will give cloud companies the agility they need to spread the word about their services on a broader scale and gain new customers in new markets and new industries and importantly at unit economics that scale positively fast In todays world the cloud isnt just the future its the bedrock on which modern companies are built and a key component of the business strategies of many titans of the software industry Lets look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Four years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>launched Office a subscriptionbased delivery model for their flagship product Office and turned to partners in the channel to scale worldwide On their FY Q Earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced that Office revenue was up year over year with strong adoption across all segments Additionally nearly channel partners now deliver Office to small and medium businesses around the globe Thats a increase in channel partners year over year those partners have contributed to Microsofts growth in the market contributing more than customers a month for consecutive months Could <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have driven this level of momentum without turning to the channel reseller market Perhaps But not without time and resourceconsuming investments to dive headlong into unfamiliar markets and establishing relations with disparate SMBs who may prefer a more handson relationship with a trusted local advisor The aforementioned million businesses around the world that turn to a reseller ecosystem do so to embrace the cloud technologies that will help them drive their own futures In a recent global study by the Boston Consulting Group small and mediumsized businesses that adopted the latest IT tools and cloud services grew revenue profitability and jobs measurably faster than their less techsavvy counterparts These small lean organizations often dont have the resources to field a full IT team turning instead to their existing relationships in the channel for all of their IT needs By also turning their attention to the channel cloud companies can reach these SMBs and extend their reach without overextending their resources The potential extended reach that channel resellers can provide is considerable Dropbox Private DROPB for example works with distribution partners like Ingram Micro which has a dedicated global cloud team to drive sales readiness and results for SaaS Theyve also made investments to improve SaaS adoption for their reseller communities For example late last year Ingram Micro purchased Odin an automation platform that streamlines and simplifies the SaaS reseller experience Through the Odin acquisition Ingram Micro has gained a fully automated marketplace and can reach even more markets enabling thousands more resellers That extended reach means more potential customers for Ingram Micros partners For Dropbox that partnership with Ingram Micro means being able to go to market with fewer direct costs and less overhead in the future The global reseller ecosystem becomes crucial here With many companies around the world looking for local trusted reseller partners for IT advice and supply turning to the channel can help cloud companies like Dropbox scale meaningfully Whats in it for you Embrace the channel With SaaS resellers will deliver valueadded services such as implementation data migration training and customer support Customers will enjoy lower initial costs and lower overhead costs thanks to minimal IT needs And SaaS offers seamless integrations between thousands of products so resellers can create best in breed solutions that serve their clients best Early to midstage cloud companies are typically also faced with the dilemma of how to expand globally outside of their core markets Scaling through the channel leveraging the global infrastructure of distribution partners enables you to gain global coverage without having any resources outside of your home market essentially outsourcing your global channel enablement marketing sales and support to a distribution partner The notion of when to get engaged when to start working with a distribution partner isnt all that obvious While on the one hand the benefits may seem obvious to your company there also has to be a clear winwinwin in it for the distribution partners and the resellers The recipe for when to start a channel program is a function of critical mass of your business the profitability of your services for the partners as well as the ability of your services to be bundled with other vendors solutions To get started consider hiring in leadership talent that has worked in the reseller channel before and who has successfully built a channel program from the ground up before Moreover engage with the cloud practices of the leading distribution companies such as Ingram Micro Synnex Tech Data Corp and Westcon Those simple steps as well as some basic research to understand industry best practices for how to start resource and run a channel program should enable you to getting started The cloud is no longer a mystery SMBs around the world are embracing the cloud as a means to drive growth and revenue For cloud companies seeking to maximize their potential and reach businesses whose needs arent met by traditional direct outbound sales or selfservice models weaving the channel into SaaS distribution efforts will deliver real results Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Application Software Expert Insight SA Submit
