budgetphone vendor Micromax chose Intel with its first ever laptop product I like it very much that Intels NASDAQ INTC stock price is now above Good propaganda on Seeking Alpha often does influence the outlook of many investors Im therefore publishing more good news for INTC believers HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ which previously signedup to market Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro to its enterprise clients unveiled its own Windows version of the Surface Pro Like Dell HewlettPackard is not going to play as a mere subordinateminion to Microsofts ambitious plan to saturate the enterprise market with Surface computers The Spectre x is HewlettPackards latest tabletlaptop for its enterprise clients I like it also that HP will go allSkylake for its latest Windows laptops The Spectre s CPU is better than the Core M variety that is found inside the MacBook Aside from giving Intel the processor supply deal HPs latest laptop also comes equipped with a RealSense Camera and premium Bang Olufsen audio The basic model of the HP Spectre will retail for Budgetconstrained corporations who are intimidated with the basic price tag of the Surface Book would therefore likely consider HPs much cheaper Spectre or the Surface Pro It doesnt really matter if HP will promote Spectre over Surface Pro when it makes sales presentations to corporate buyers Intel will still benefit from HPs use of the RealSense Camera and Skylake Core mseries processors Just like Dell HewlettPackard is one of the worlds top vendors of laptopnotebook computers The next version of the more expensive HP Spectre in laptop will also feature a Skylake CPU and RealSense Camera Microsofts new Hello feature for Windows really requires PC manufacturers to equip their new highend products with Intels superior facial recognition capable RealSense D Camera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt really mind that its enterprise market distribution partners are creating clones of its trendsetting Surface Pro Dell also released its own topoftheline clone of the Surface Pro <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>even announced the Intelpowered Dell XPS in hybrid laptoptablet on its official blog Like HewlettPackard Dell rebooted its XPS line of laptops to go allSkylake The Dell XPS s best features are its touchfriendly K Ultra HD inch display and the detachable magnetic keyboard The Dell XPS laptop also touts a touchscreen K display and a discrete Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA GeForce M GPU The Nvidiapowered Dell XPS will likely compete with the pricey Surface Book which also has a secret new GPU from Nvidia INTC is still a Buy at price levels The continuing decline in PC sales is annoying However the introduction of touchenabled Windows laptops and desktop computers might eventually reverse this trend I opine that consumers will get back to buying more laptops once all OEMs retire their outdated nontouchscreen computer products Buyers are wiser now Instead of them buying a separate laptop and a tablet they now expect the in tabletnotebook form factor to be the new norm Dell and HewlettPackard are just two important supporterstailwinds for the new Intel Skylake processors These two global PC giants snub of Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD Carizzo processor is one more reason to add more INTC shares I do not doubt that Carizzo SoC is competent even for highend Windows laptops The only problem for Dr Lisa Su AMDs CEO is that leading PC manufacturers remain loyal to Intel It also very depressing for AMD that even small OEMs like Micromax went Intel inside for its firstever laptop product The inch Micromax Canvas LapBook is a Windows laptop for the Indian market It retails for Rs and it is equipped with an th Gen Intel Atom quadcore CPU It might be presumptuous of me but I think AMD will not survive for long under Intels assault AMD investors should think really hard Nobody seems to be interested in playing the white knight and rescue AMD from Intels continuing encroachment of its already tiny PC processor market I opine that it would be an act of mercy if Intel purchases the recently spunoff Radeon Technologies division This sale will be substantial money to poor marginalizedostracized AMD Common sense is telling me that separating Radeon from its core CPU business gives AMD the opportunity to entice thirdparty firms who might want to buy Nvidias only remaining rival Once it has its own GPU division Intel could possibly exert its strong influence over PC manufacturers so that some of them would drop Nvidia GPUs in favor of Intelowned discrete Radeon video cards Supplying both the CPU and discrete CPU is definitely better than Intel just selling the processor to WinTel computers We only use
