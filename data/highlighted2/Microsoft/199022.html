in the face of cheap Surfaces Im here to assure investors that its not ARM presently has its limitations but with the level of performance Apple achieves using ARM its clear the iPad is becoming the predator in this space iPad sales are still going over a speed bump but the iPad Pro sets the iPad tablet up for growth over the long run With all due respect to Alcaraz Research I must say that I strongly disagree with his negative opinions toward an Intelless iPad simply due to its lack of a longterm outlook In a recent article Alcaraz Research wrote By not using an Intel processor Apple intentionally made the iPad Pro less usableinferior than the much cheaper Surface Last quarter Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPad revenue dropped while Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Surface revenue rose which in my opinion makes Alcaraz Researchs statement a serious one because it misleads investors into believing that cheaper Surfaces are superior to much more expensive iPads simply due to the processor If the iPad utilized an Intel NASDAQ INTC processor that ran OSX instead of iOS the iPad would surely become more usable But the term usable would become questionable Windows still has millions of programs that havent been rewritten to be fully optimized for touch And although these applications run they simply dont work in the manner that the crude touch of a finger demands a touchenabled OSX would be even worse than Windows On the other hand everything on iOS works But without the decades of software accumulation that PC has had the app base is inevitably limited The fact of the matter here is that both Surface and iPad are still burrowing through the outer layer of the tablet PC and that the ideal tablet still requires years of further development Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Apple have two unique methods that will both likely prevail And with that being said investors should find little concern over iPad Pros lack of an x processor but rather what the iPad Pro truly is and thats a device of enablement With a vastly improved processor a larger screen and the longawaited input of a stylus customers will find that an explosion in app development is underway which will serve as the foundation of restoring iPad sales as well as Apples falling stock Before I draw meaning for investors Id like to briefly discuss the power of the iPad Pro If this isnt your forte you can skip this section and jump to the next bold line knowing that the iPad Pros AX chip is just fast Really fast In order for a tablet to replace a laptop the processor in which it utilizes must be at least as powerful as a laptop while consuming dramatically less power Microsofts Surface Pro is proof that the ideal processor is still in development simply because it still uses a laptopgrade processor instead of a tablet one If we look at a comparison of the iPad Air s AX processor and the Surface Pro s i processor you can get a ballpark understanding of how far Apple has brought up the speed of its processor In the chart below youll find that the Surface Pro is about faster than the iPad Air which is a noticeable difference But as I mentioned the Surface Pro uses laptop grade processors while iPad uses much lower power tabletgrade processors Before the iPad Air s leap forward investors had every reason to be concerned with the iPads processor development because it would have needed another decade in order to catch up with laptops However the iPad Air boasted a CPU and x GPU increase over the original iPad Air Fortunately with iPad Pros AX chip this rate of improvement accelerated with a whopping CPU and x GPU enhancement in spite of having nearly twice the pixels to push This is compared to Intel whose Skylake Core M tablet chip was said to be a CPU increase and GPU increase over the previous Broadwell Core M This is why the Surface Pro couldnt fully utilize a tablet processor and instead had to maintain a thicker fancooled design to compensate for laptopgrade processors iPad Pro enables future iPad lineups A far quicker processor yields a new range of applications which leads me to the misconception that iOS isnt a full operating system but rather a baby or limited operating system This misconception is simply due to iOSs lack of major PC programs and its temporary lack of multitasking and there are two reasons why these problems exist First is that the PC has had literally decades to accumulate programs by creative developers while the iPad has only had five And second is that the much slower ARM processors were formerly incapable of running such sophisticated software Investors will find fortune that with iPad Pros new processor and with a little more time this will all change iOS developers have proven themselves as outstandingly creative and with every new feature thats added whether its gyroscopes or D touch comes a barrage of new applications that are born With iPad Pro Apple delivered four new features for developers to build on a larger screen an exceptional processor multitasking and a new input device the Apple Pencil These are all big deliveries that will spark growth in the app database and overall the functionality of the iPad Pro and all future iPads to come For Apples fiscal second quarter the iPad marked its second year of yearoveryear declines and its possible that it wont be the last The growth of Surface tablets is proof that people dont want to own tablets as companion devices but rather as replacement devices Last year I wrote that the iPad Air didnt provide this replacement functionality And unfortunately the iPad Pro doesnt either However unlike iPad Air which simply added a leap forward in processing power the iPad Pro delivers a faster processor multitasking iOS a larger screen and a new form of input from a stylus This is important because its a step forward and that the primary problem with iPads lies with their app base rather than their processor and with millions of iPads being sold each quarter developers have plenty of reason to develop for the iPad Pro Furthermore with the iPad Pros capabilities a barrage of professional applications costing hundreds of dollars such as AutoCad will surface which will show that the iPad is going to become a very serious device The problem with the iPad Pro isnt its processor at least not anymore The iPad Pro delivers processing power thats sufficient for serious app developers to give it a run for its money The problem is a lack of applications that can be used which as Ive covered in this article will only take a short time to resolve In most cases the market wants results and as the worlds most valued company investors are going to want results It has been a year since Tim Cook called Apples sales a speed bump and this quarters results are going to show that we are still going over this speed bump which may disappoint investors Because of this I wont recommend buying Apple given its standing under its week high I cant say that owning Apple is a bad choice I give the company a hold at and under Im a buyer for the long haul We only use your contact details to
