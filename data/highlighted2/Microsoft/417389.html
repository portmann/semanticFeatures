class='textDiv'>Apple Watch Positives Remain Few And Far Between Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha AW will likely be untethered and come with a sales boost from larger distribution Fitbit is not validating Apple Watch and has surpassed sales of Apple Watch due to greater consumer alignment with Blaze As a consultant what Im asked to do is to discover the product development cycle sample the products and offer my complete analysis based on my resources and experience When Ive reviewed and analyzed the products potential I disseminate a conclusive outlook So in this very public manner Im going to offer the very same verbiage I offered only three years ago to Keurig Green Mountain Stop just stop and move onto something else Im offering this to smartwatch manufacturers and especially to Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL with regards to its future iterations of the Apple Watch And with that being offered Ill ask the following question to readers Have you ever heard of vaporware In the computer industry vaporware is a product typically computer hardware or software that is announced to the general public but is never actually manufactured nor officially cancelled Use of the word has broadened to include products such as automobiles and appliances in recent years Vaporware in practical terms has also been realized by many product introductions that have exhibited short life spans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is largely accredited with coining the term vaporware and oddly enough its former Zune is a perfect example of a widely hyped introduced and soon thereafter failed piece of vaporware I believe in many ways that the smartwatch is another example of vaporware It is widely hyped found distribution and found with declining sales soon thereafter with necessary new iterations to offset YOY declining sales But that game can only be played for so long Typically vaporware offers the extended purpose for a technology another application if you will Unfortunately the further we stretch the application of said technology the less useful it becomes for additional purposes In many cases the only way it can be anything but vaporware is through the cannibalization of the former technology application Many products come to market year after year after year after year Some have longevity while others do not D printers became the craze of and before market saturation was found to be the dominant sales achievement for these products Without greater distribution to be found companies selling D printers found themselves relying on the usefulness of the products and general sellthrough of the products at retail locations Unfortunately D printers have been found to be another form of vaporware that was interesting for a little while but far less useful to the general public than the greatness of the idea assumed it to be The chart of D Systems Corp NYSE DDD is a perfect depiction of what happens post the distribution saturation of a largely useless product for the general public D printers didnt really solve a problem for consumers In short it was a solution looking for a problem to lend itself greater utility than designed When I evaluate a product Im forced to first recognize form and function followed by utility andor usefulness Within those variables is an equation that will be able to discern an addressable market for a product and potential longterm sales Smartwatches make for an interesting potential utilitarian product Having said that the product defies most every trend in place regarding accessories for now several decades alongside attempting to miniaturize the functionality of a smartphone Engineers are wise to what happens when you attempt to miniaturize things Smartwatches Epitome of Backward Technology As smartwatches came to the market only a couple of years ago they becam distributed I would like to say they became popular but that simply isnt the case While millions of units have been shipped it is a far cry from how many cell phones are shipped and sold annually and even since the invention of the smartwatch Heck there are more coffee makers shipped annually than smartwatch shipments There are a great many reasons for why the smartwatch isnt as popular as it aims to be but mostly it comes down to form function and cost Cell phones by and large replaced the watch on our wrists the pay phone and eventually other equipment such as GPS devices It is for this reason if not any other that smartwatch technology is a form of vaporware a solution looking for a problem where one does not necessarily exist Most everything the smartphone already does the smartwatch aims to do in a miniaturized form factor While that may have been where some of the success for the cell phone came from miniaturization and mobility there are limitations and consumers determine those limitations which are aligned with cost For every single smartwatch that has come to market it has taken less than a year to witness sales declines that have only proliferated further post the products anniversary Apple Watch is only the latest in a string of smartwatches that anniversary with sales declines Smartwatch screens are too small have poor battery life and overall lesser functionality Its the epitome of backwards technology implementation Apples greatest return rate for any of its products come from smartwatches and for mentioned and unmentioned reasons Many people buy the device thinking it is cool new and will perform as advertised What many people fail to recognize is the functionality demands a behavioral change on the part of the user Smaller screens and smaller touch points are found to be a significant reason for product returns while total functionality is found to be yet another reason for outsized returns Smartwatches have become the latest in a string of products that have been widely hyped in the media as the next great thing but found wanting for greater adoption and sales Virtual Reality NYSE VR products are in that same category of products widely hyped but found wanting Like smartwatches and even basic fitness tracker devices VR products offer a solution looking for a problem to solve that likely doesnt exist Again this is backward technology implementation Besides the complexity for engineering these otherwise miniaturized technology form factors aimed to deliver greater utility they simply deliver nothing more than a novel experience that many users care not to repeat As I wrote in a previous article VR products are finding distribution and some early adoption but not much else The actual sales forecasts that have been lowered and lowered yet again twice this year for VR products Superdata has lowered its expectations for virtual reality revenues in for the second time in as many months The market intelligence firm today revised its global VR hardware and software forecast down percent from billion to billion Its projection at the beginning of the year had been billion The revision came with the release of the firms Virtual Reality and the Next Killer App report which identified a number of reasons for the downgrade among them recent production and fulfillment issues that have affected the Oculus Rift the HTC Vive and even the Samsung Gear VR The report says about million Americans intend to purchase a VR headset this year but Superdata is only expecting shipments of million Smartwatch Manufacturers Ignore Form Factor Trends Smartwatches dont solve any problem the smartphone hasnt solved more efficiently and in an ideal form factor People simply dont like to wear watches and that is the watch industry sales talking against the cell phone sales The numbers havent and to this day dont lie Having said that there is nothing positive about the Apple Watch other than Apples ability to generate billions in revenues from the product as distribution partners have yet to understand the real value of the product In other words the distribution partners bought a branded Apple product more so than the Apple Watch These distribution partners have a better idea of the Apple Watch potential a year after dismal sellthrough results and markdowns but even so they will likely give Apple and its peers another shot with a new and improved smartwatch iteration Untethering the Apple Watch from its iPhone compatible parent technology is a step forward but within that promotion of usefulness comes with it even more impediments to adoption A builtin Bluetooth Wifi cell chip enabled device will deliver great stresses on the battery of the Apple Watch that have been exhibited already on the Samsung Gear smartwatch Smartwatches attempt to defy physics and engineering might In doing so smartwatches place themselves squarely in the crosshairs of where consumption for smart devices proliferates more broadly with smartphones Now lets talk about relevant data and sales for wearables as recently offered by Robert Lehar in Positive Signs For Apple Watch I never believed the Apple Watch had the ability or potential to disrupt the cell phonesmartphone industry Secondly I dont believe the product has any potential to become the next great thing for communication devices The smartwatch is no MP player in that the MP player offered what no predecessor music technology system could do place s of songs in your pocket at the touch of a button The smartwatch does exactly what the smartphone does but with lesser efficacy and in a proven to be less desired form factor That is not a recipe for market disruption In the article Positive Signs For Apple Watch the authors fashions reasons why the Apple Watch has a good opportunity The first reason being that total wearables devices are expanding presently at a clip according to IDC The most important aspect of this data point supported in the following chart is that this data point is shipments of units and not actual sellthrough to consumers Sell through rate is far less than unit shipments and is just one of the reasons that the leader in wearables Fitbit NYSE FIT is watching its sales growth decelerate from last year to roughly in Its rather easy to gain distribution for a new product and with international supply and distribution lines being what they are today Retail and consumer interest shows the wearables market is on the right trajectory with much potential to disrupt traditional watchmaking and expand the TAM for wristworn devices What Mr Lehar isnt offering is that not all the shipments being offered by IDC sales tracking come from wristworn devices At least of wearables are worn elsewhere on the body or embedded into other formfactors like shoes shirts and headgear But dont worry the sellthrough is worse for devices not worn on the wrist and as such they arent even discussed publicly to the extent they are for wristworn devices Moreover Mr Lehar advances the topic of differentiating wearables into basic and smartwatch categories as defined in IDC reporting What is important for readers to better understand is that with respect to the IDC reported tracking results for Q is that they dont take into account Fitbits smart watch named Blazeand it shouldnt It shouldnt because the product didnt launch until early Q Having said that Blaze has usurped sales of Apple Watch on amazoncom and more broadly in the massmarket sales channel In Q thus far and as reported by Fitbit during its Q results dissemination the company shipped roughly mm Blaze units This would put Fitbit above Samsung in the Top Five Smartwatch Vendors as of that reporting period In short and come IDCs Q reporting period the firm will likely update its vendor list to show Fitbit as either number or number with regards to top smartwatch vendors Furthermore what the grand takeaway from these general sales statistics is that we are talking about less than mm smartwatch units shipped Can you imagine how long it would take to supplant or even draw even with smartphone sales Numbers dont lie and the rate of adoption for smartwatches is just not there to achieve a status of the next great thing by any smartwatch manufacturer When Apple launches the AW later this year it will likely be an untethered smartwatch Here is what to expect with this iteration Massive sales boost due to carrier inclusion from the likes of ATT NYSE T Verizon NYSE V China Mobile etc Sheer distribution gains will be tremendous boost to units shipped as presently carriers cant adopt the product as it is tethered Analyst will praise the AW for its sales boost being a factor of untethering the device when the actual sales boost is the inclusion of greater distribution or sellin A revisiting of past arguments from sentiment surrounding the Apple Watch AW will require a separate data plan and must be paired with an iPhone AW will require connection fee of and monthly data plan of in conjunction with smartphone plan AW will have improved battery life but not much Almost of watch body is the battery AW will not perform functions that a smartphone cant perform at a lesser cost It has been offered that Fitbit validates Apples approach to smartwatches by Mr Lehar While this is often offered as a comparative and qualitative analysis for like products or product approach it rarely defines validity in product development Lets carefully analyze what Mr Lehar offers in this respect of product validation Apples approach to wearables is being increasingly validated by Fitbit Earlier this year the company released a fitnessoriented smartwatch the Blaze and since then has frequently talked about innovation and opportunities to integrate their products with the cars or homes or buildings or payments or identity authentication This was recently followed by Fitbit acquiring wearable payment assets of Coin a Silicon Valley consumer electronics and financial technology company Note what Fitbit CEO James Park had to say about the purchase The inclusion of their payment technology into our offerings will further our strategy of making Fitbit products an indispensable part of peoples lives At this point there cannot be any doubt that Fitbit is embracing and validating Apples concept of wearables by making them smarter more valuable and more integrated into customers lives However compared to Fitbit Apple can already enjoy a large head start with its apps and mobile payments infrastructure Furthermore it has the benefit of a massmarket brand which is a better fit for a universal device like the smartwatch catering to various interests activities and needs The primary issue with this comparative and qualitative offering by Mr Lehar is that the premise must assume Apple Watch is generating increased adoption and sales if it is in fact to be found the right approach Unfortunately what we are forced to understand is that is not the case at all With analytics if the premise is wrong the totality of the analysis is found in error It is also important to understand that the total concept of Fitbits smartwatch excludes the redundancy of smartphone applications unlike that of the Apple Watch that has found sales deteriorating In short Fitbits Blaze smartwatch is less of a smartwatch in function than in form factor It really is a glorified fitness tracker with improved upon functionality Lastly the sheer dominance of fitness tracker sales to smartwatch sales exonerates any validity assigned to the notion that Apple and Apple Watch hadhave the right approach Apple would have obviously been wiser to develop fitness tracker stand alone products While Fitbit is aiming to deliver greater functionality and utility for its fitness and smart fitness devices it still remains to be seen if these improvements can boost sellthrough yearoveryear The suggestion that with Fitbit acquiring Coin assets validates Apple Watchs approach to smartwatches wont be known without greater YOY results Apple Watch with Apple Pay hasnt shown Apples smartwatch to grow sellthrough and as such the premise of Mr Lehars analysis hasnt been proven either I would forecast that greater applications and functionality of these fitness and smartwatches will do little to nothing in aiding greater adoption and sales longterm Again these additions dont solve problems or address a larger market and in many cases decrease functionality while increasing failure and attrition rates The only reason that anybody discusses Fitbits attrition rate and not the attrition rate of smartwatches is because all that is available publicly is Fitbits metrics in this regard But the Apple Watch can gain a bigger market with clinical applications I agree that it could but that bigger market still cant move the needle for Apple and still will never be able to supplant the sales of the iPhone The numbers dont lie What most people refer to regarding Apple Watch or any wearable achieving clinical applications is that it must achieve at least FDA Class II medial grade status This takes years to achieve and I wouldnt put it past Apple to be effecting this product development But in no way would such a smart device be consumer driven In fact it would have to be prescribed by a physician The largest market available for medical applications is the market for cardiovascular disease Diagnostic tests such as ECGs are used to detect diagnose and track certain types of cardiovascular conditions The US portion of the ECG market is expected to be worth billion in and is comprised of three major segments resting nonstress ECG systems stress ECG systems and event monitoring systems The eventmonitoring segment alone is expected to be worth bn in according to CardioNet NASDAQ BEAT and is currently broken into the Holter Event Loop and mobile cardiac telemetry MCT monitoring categories What many would desire for Apple and its Apple Watch to be able to service is the MCT market place MCTs are in need of advancing technology for remote patient care and the market is largely moving in that direction The MCT diagnostic is a robust continuous remote monitoring solution for cardiac arrhythmia and it often eliminates the need for expensive overnight monitoring in a hospital However the MCT devices currently available are based on outdated technologies which often require a patient to wear a bulky device and are not readily accessible In the US MCT tests are primarily conducted through outsourced Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities IDTFs that are reimbursed at an average rate of per diagnostic test There are currently five competitors within the US MCT diagnostic market which have effectively restricted MCT services to outsourced clinics and locked physicians out of the MCT market with no ability to receive financial reimbursement for MCT diagnostics Today some MCT devices offer real time tracking and feedback through the implementation of Bluetooth and cell connectivity but most do not because of the necessary time to achieve efficacy results and to then be cleared by the FDA The problems that prevented remote patient care and the greater use of MCTs in the past were related to billing codes and how the system reimbursed for these MCT devices In the past there was no billing code available for MCTs and physicians were forced to use an outsourced payment model that only benefited the medical device sellers and monitoring centers Since the Affordable Care act however billing codes for MCTs have been made available for use Maybe it would behoove Apple and the Apple Watch technology to move into clinical applications but even so the dollar value cant move the needle for Apple For Fitbit it certainly could but not Apple Apple will be competing with already existing MCT technologies for that forecasted bn for event monitoring solutions through Even if Apple garnered a of that dollar value it doesnt do much for Apple if its iPhone iPad and iMac sales continue to decline For all that is consistently offered by the media for what the Apple Watch can could or should do youve likely never seen the relative dollar values assigned to the clinical applications Most reporters dont dive that deep and care not to view the prospects in that manner as they dont consider the potential along the lines that the investor does or should In truth most companies with these fitness trackers and wearable devices aimed at health wellness dont want the FDA involved as they are largely absent regulating these products to date While some apps not devices but apps have been FDA approved it is not likely that a wristborn consumer device will achieve FDA medical grade clearance by Apple or Fitbit in the near future And Apple doesnt really want to go down that road anyway it is far too long a road for a smartwatch to travel Here is what Tim cook offered last year regarding this very subject matter We dont want to put the watch through the Food and Drug Administration FDA process I wouldnt mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it but not the watch because it would hold us back from innovating too much the cycles are too long But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to itmaybe an app maybe something else Tim Cook said in the interview for the Telegraph The Apple Watch akin to D Printers VR and Keurig Kold is a good idea but the practicality leaves much to be desired The only thing that validates this statement are the sales trends in relation with what the Apple Watch is truly trying assumed to supplant in the smartphone One can literally walk into a smartwatch retailer ask any question they want pertaining to the device and never be found wanting for the answer But my smartphone can already do that The Apple Watch is likely not the next great thing and there are few positives to the device What I believe most people assume is that the smartphone features and applications can be duplicated in the watch and function to the same degree as the smartphone I would be of the opinion this is not a likely end game as has been evidenced by former technology convergence products The smartphone is much bigger than the MP player which was incorporated into the smartphone and as an example My investment thesis for AAPL share is not favorable and as such I am avoiding shares of AAPL unless they exhibit meaningfully lower share prices With the company lowering FY guidance and metrics I dont believe consumer spending trends will alleviate guidance and metric concerns In kind I believe shares of AAPL will trend lower over the next day period Why I would not short shares of AAPL is largely due to the companys superior balance sheet and flexibility With that being said there are likely better opportunities to invest elsewhere I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
