</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made a very under the radar acquisition that I think will be huge for its model at scale VoloMetrix provides organizational analytics that should allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>customers to better manage human capital and to optimize knowledge worker productivity a uniform and huge concern at every level This tech will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>an early mover in a niche in its infancy and one that I believe will be defensive once aggregated This tech also should embellish the value prop of the overall productivity suite especially Power BI This is just one more perfectly fitting acquisition for Satya Nadellas New <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which is working toward a oneplatform productivity model Almost every single day when Im scouring the internet for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT news I find something that further impresses me about the company and about the new direction the company is taking Ive covered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for Seeking Alpha pretty intensely since Satya Nadella took control and Ive been consistently astonished by the overall reshaping and the turnaround of generally everything Yes everything Even when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was forced to write down the massive failure that was Nokia a former CEO Steve Ballmer misstep to be sure it was done with a purpose in mind and a general direction No longer does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>seem like a hodgepodge collection of ideas and products a rudderless ship at sea The company now with its focused initiatives and its clear plan of execution has done extremely well to further its vision of becoming a oneplatform productivity company The news of its VoloMetrix acquisition to which financial terms have not been disclosed should only further the company down the road to where its already heading Dont overlook this small rollup its going to matter in a big way very soon VoloMetrix is a four and a half year old organizational analytics startup VoloMetrix uses data gathered from knowledge worker productivity systems read the type of platforms that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>sells under its general productivity suite umbrella email calendar etc to transform knowledge worker productivity through data transparency and feedback loops SOURCE VoloMetrix MSFT acquisition blog The value prop that VoloMetrix brought to its customers was that it could put a quantitative value or measurement on how employeesteams were driving outcomes for their company a hugely meaningful valueadd at that The use cases here arent endless but theyre all Human Capital HC knowledge worker optimization based and HC is a huge overhead cost for most enterprises Largely its one of the biggest fixed costs within an operating model With VoloMetrix companies can work to optimize HC while also furthering optimization of organizational HC management from a productivity standpoint Put simply VoloMetrix can help answer the questions of not who should we hire as HCM would but where should we have our best workers spend their timewhere are our weakest workers lagging and how can we optimize productionetc That really really matters when you have thousands of employees that are expected to create billions of dollars of market cap Heck it matters when you only have a handful of employees but each is paramount to your livelihood I could go on about the value that VoloMetrix brings to the SMBenterprise but I think the point is made here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>customers should be really really happy to know that VoloMetrix help is on the way They should be even happier to know how VoloMetrix is going to be deployed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>plans to not offer VoloMetrixs tech as a standalone solution but integrated within Office From this integration <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will have a significant buildout of its Delve Organizational Analytics techplatform which is expected to be a quasiBI that runs autonomously in the background of the broader productivity suite Delve will be able to do exactly what VoloMetrix has been able to do for its customers now having acquired VoloMetrix only with seamless and perfect integration Think the difference between content pack and native From a speed and overall breadth of analysis standpoint that matters as well So lets tie it altogether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now gets what I would call a best of breed technology albeit a young breed of technology to help build out a technologyplatform Delve that I can only presume wouldnt have been as good without it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also gets a major productivity and optimization valueadd to pitch to potential customers which are already being pitched on productivity and optimization You could say thats pretty synergistic to the overall sales model at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I would Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gets more data more BI and a potential new vertical for selling its overall standalone BI platform Power BI Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gets an overall model overlay that it can continue to find ways to drop into its model over the midterm an overlay that is addressing a need thats uniform across its customer base and an overlay thats attacking a niche thats in its infancy Guys again dont overlook how big this is and how big this can be Just because the technology was coming from a startup doesnt mean it cant and wont be hugely meaningful when scaled up into the massive ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>immediately brings to the table I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is getting a huge first mover advantage in this niche and like other disruptive tech productivity techs think CRM platforms or Inbound Marketing platforms I also think thats going to be huge in aggregating a customer base that can be retained I think in this particular niche and I alluded to this in a recent IBM note the learnings taken from the data gathered and analyzed will be cumulative To be clear what I mean is that over time the system in place will have a definitive incumbent advantage in that it will have a history of readings and coaching suggestions given as well as a collection of outcomes derived from those readings The general point is that as with CRM and other actionable smart dataheavy systems of record the switching costs of changing systems of record grows with time That understanding could be part of the reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is willing to get out ahead of the curve on this niche something that it hasnt been willing to do regularly throughout its history Of course this could just be yet another cultural evolution put in place by Satya Nadella one that favors innovation and measured risk taking Regardless Im bullish this acquisition and I hope analysts on the next earnings call make this a point of focus I think this could have very wide ranging implications Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am
