Seeking Alpha As of October there are now more than million people who installed Windows King Digital kept its promise It released Candy Crush Soda Saga to all Windows users Windows users are now able to play Candy Crush Soda Saga on their desktop computers without having to use Facebook NASDAQ FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and King Digital NYSE KING have released the topgrossing freemium match puzzle game Candy Crush Soda Saga on the Windows app store King is obviously expecting that the popular Windows PC platform could help it increase its pool of paying players There are now more than million people who actively use Windows as their main desktop operating system Such a huge user base is always attractive to mobile game publishers eager to monetize their games outside of Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL app stores Below is my retired level Candy Crush Soda Saga account which I now only occasionally use to give lives to my Facebook friends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now poised to get a cut of Kings revenue stream from Candy Crush Soda Saga when players do inapp purchases via the Windows app store King made the Candy Crush Soda Saga crossplatform last December However while I could play the same account on Android iOS devices and on Facebooks website King never released any version for Windows Phone or a standalone version for Windows desktop computers The million strong Windows user population is a rich pool for King Digital to find paying customers Candy Crush Soda Saga is free to play However like Candy Crush Saga it strongly favors players who make inapp purchases The highly social nature of this game requires competitive players to buy premium currency from King Spending real dollars allows a player to progress much faster than their friendsrelatives who do not make inapp purchases Since King Digital has successfully ported Candy Crush Soda Saga to Windows PCs I expect the Windows OS mobile version to also come soon The mobile version of this game is a super cash generator for King Digital As per the latest data of Sensor Tower Candy Crush Soda Sagas net sales commission of Google and Apple was already deducted for September was million King Digital will likely again use Microsofts free Project Astoria conversion tool to port Candy Crush Soda Saga to the Windows Mobile OS King is probably only waiting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to do its final release of Windows Mobile before it announces Candy Crush Soda Saga for Windows phonestablets King Digital is one of the worlds leading game publishers Its support for Windows is a small but important tailwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The Candy Crush game titles are certified blockbuster hits that generate millions of dollars in daily sales It is good that the Windows PC app store will now have a chance to enjoy a commission from bigspending addicted Candy Crush Soda Saga players Microsofts willingness to give away free Windows OS licenses is a smart bet that should help it attain the same measure of popularity the Android OS currently enjoys The cut of Google from annual inapp purchases done through its Play Store is already a figure revenue stream Microsofts free Office and other mobile apps are just baits to gather more users inside its Windows ecosystem Once app developers notice a substantial increase in Windows mobile user base they will heed King Digitals example and will also port their topgrossing games <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>intends to have billion Windows devices on the planet Ignoring this massive pool of potential paying players will be painful for any selfrespecting game developerpublisher Imitating Googles successful formula is really not that hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>In my own analysis the cheat sheet that Google used toward its billion glory only took five simple steps Cheap Android devices led to billion people using Googles mobile OS The huge population of Android users made it very
