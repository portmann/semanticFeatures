sunny climate for US business Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed on Wednesday to cut restrictions on foreign investment while his chief Internet regulator appeared to lay the groundwork for a basic agreement later this week on cyber warfare Xis busy stop on the West Coast is the first leg of a weeklong trip to the United States and offers him a chance to highlight Chinas cooperation with US companies before he heads to Washington where he will contend with the full spectrum of irritants in relations from tension in the South China Sea to human rights The Chinese leader started the day by publicly assuring US business leaders that he is making it easier to invest in China and he was later quizzed in a private session about intellectual property protection common standards and clear transparent regulations according to the Paulson Institute which hosted the event We are working to create a new open economic system push forward reform of foreign investment management and greatly reduce the restrictions on foreign investment Xi told the gathering of executives in Seattle including Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook and Berkshire Hathaways Warren Buffett GM and Ford can increase their investment in China Xi said A few hours after Boeing Co announced plans for an aircraft finishing center in China its first outside the United States To the east of Seattle at Microsofts campus in Redmond Chinas top Internet regulator told US tech executives that both countries must work together on cyber security issues including crime and espionage addressing one of their most pressing concerns We are on the same boat said Lu Wei at the eighth annual meeting of the USChina Internet Industry Forum The only choice we have is to cooperate In a closeddoor session afterwards Lu gave the impression that China and the United States were set to reach some kind of agreement on cyber warfare banning attacks on infrastructure in peacetime according to one person present who asked not to be named given the privacy of the meeting Samm Sacks an analyst at USbased consulting firm Eurasia Group said that American business leaders remain chiefly concerned with cyber theft targeting corporate secrets though any renewed cyber crime dialogue with Washington likely would be limited in scope and not deal with corporate espionage Overall I do not see any meaningful progress on cyber issues or a shift in Beijings approach toward US tech companies in China Sacks said VISITS MICROSOFT CAMPUS HIGH SCHOOL Xi later visited Microsofts campus in Seattle where he was greeted by cofounder Bill Gates CEO Satya Nadella and other top executives He was then led to a gathering of American and Chinese CEOs and was greeted among others by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who spoke to the Chinese leader in Mandarin The conversation which was private lasted about a minute Facebook is banned in China Although some companies had privately spread word that the meeting with their CEOs could prove significant and last an hour or more in fact it was little more than pleasantries and a photo op A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft

in Tacoma south of Seattle along with first lady Peng Liyuan They watched the schools football team practice before addressing students in a packed auditorium Xi urged the students to carry on the spirit of ping pong diplomacy that years ago was so important to boosting USChina relations The worlds biggest plane makers longexpected move into lowcost China followed its news of a big order for some planes from China valued at about billion at list prices But the finishing center plan has not been popular with labor unions and also attracted the ire of leading Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump who said it would take jobs away from the United States Xi toured the Everett Washington factory where Boeing its largest aircraft and was shown a demonstration on board a Dreamliner which is popular with Chinese airlines The plant would showcase the new spirit of cooperation touted by Xi but several Boeing workers protested outside the Everett plant We dont have a problem with China We have a problem that this could equate to machinists losing jobs said Joel Hetland a structures mechanic on the while waving a sign They Boeing dont have to worry about the EPA Environmental Protection Agency there they dont have to worry about human rights they dont have to worry about the hour work week Xis comments on foreign investment were designed to please US business China has repeatedly pledged to loosen restrictions on foreign investment as it tries to improve inefficient stateowned firms and adopt marketfriendly policies to stave off slowing growth but foreign business groups say that so far action has not kept pace with promises US investors would like a bilateral investment treaty that would give them increased access to statedominated industries such as telecommunications and financial services Xi said a key part of Chinas reforms would be to reduce the scope of the current negative list of industries in which foreigners could not invest He added Our positive list will be bigger a longer list We will continue to build an open and lawbased environment Chinese regulators issued a negative list of prohibited and restricted industries for foreign investors in March though business lobbies have complained that the government has been reluctant to cede too much control over sectors it deems central to national interests Additional reporting by
