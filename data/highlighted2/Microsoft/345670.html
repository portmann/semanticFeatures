history and business Combine both of them and you have quite a passion While reading on what makes companies into multibaggers Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL came up I started researching old documents on Apple Inc which eventually led to the IPO I wanted to know what at the time made Apple a multibagger Multibagger is a term popularized by Peter Lynch author of One Up on WallStreet and a manager at the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments from to Peter Lynch often uses the term bagger which is when a stock goes up times in value I hope Im not shocking anyone by stating the fact that Apple qualifies as a multibagger Actually Apple is a multi multibagger My research led me to the Apple IPO which was pretty interesting itself So I decided to make an article out of it to share some of my research and findings I might write an article on multibagger companies later At todays price of Apple is a bagger plus from to today without dividends For those who observed Apples share price from outside the stock performance seemed to be an unbeatable machine However a closer look would reveal that it wasnt always a fantastic engine In Apple Computer now known as Apple Inc was a very different company and Steve Jobs was a very different entrepreneur Apple had its IPO in which I review in detail below By looking at Apples stock price today around postsplit investing in Apple at the beginning would have looked like a nobrainer You always hear people saying that if they bought Company X when it first came out they would have been multimillionaires today The real story for early Apple investors however wasnt all sunshine and rainbows This is not your classic buy and hold fairy tale If you would have bought Apple at the beginning and held on to it you would have been clinically depressed for a good part of your life unless you get joy out of pain I did open my article by mentioning that Apple is a multibagger but you needed an loss twice in order to get it Source Clipping from The NewYork Times December By Vartanig G Vartan Business Print Headline New Stocks Drawing Intense Investor Interest I like how the clipping above had to mention that Apple was a Californian company that makes personal computers For part of the research I have to thank the Computer History Museum and The New York Times archives for my research The Computer History Museum has two special documents from Apple Computer during the early days of personal computing The first is the Preliminary Confidential Offering Memorandum a document supporting a private placement of funds for Apple before the IPO The document also contains the product and marketing plan Computer History Museum CEO John Hollar noted the plan also goes to great lengths to explain why anyone would even want a personal computer eg forecasting eight reasons that indeed by a household using a computer will have significant advantages over one that doesnt and that every single competitor listed is no longer in the PC business And if you are really interested the second document is the Preliminary Macintosh Business Plan which is postIPO Apple Computer Inc now renamed Apple Inc had its IPO prospectus more than thirtyfive years ago on December with million shares priced at a share postsplit Since then the stock has split four times including three for splits and recently one for split That means your shares would have multiplied into shares today or times your original holding Apple raised million Apple sold of the company of the million shares outstanding at the time On that day the Dow soared points to staging its biggest oneday rally since spring The Dow jumped because of a surprise halfpoint reduction in the prime rate by Wells Fargo to Yes you read that correctly interest rates were extremely high back then dont ever forget that it could happen again During fiscal year Apple had sales of million up from k in Earnings also came at million or EPS of compared with or EPS of in Now think of how much Apple makes every minute In Apple had sales of billion and billion in net income Apple had a second offering of million shares that quickly sold out in May Source The New York Times December First Business Page Part Source The NewYork Times Business Digest Saturday December As the article states the IPO was a major success The shares jumped immediately to peaked at and closed at The offering happened to be the largest IPO in years at the time since Comsat side note Comsat is the same company that owned the Denver Nuggets from to and bought the NHL Quebec Nordiques and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche Comsat was acquired by Lockheed Martin Corp LMT The original offering was estimated at between and but due to strong demand was raised to and An interesting detail in the article is that the SEC went after a broker because he told clients that the stock would double or triple in value after they bought it If the SEC was successful in the suit it would have given the stockholders their money back I have no clue how it turned out After they bought it is a very subjective term After they bought it the next day or after they bought it in a couple years as a buy and hold strategy Apple definitely more than tripled but it depends what time frame you are referring to Also Apples IPO wasnt available in states like Massachusetts because it was considered too risky According to a state spokesman Apples book value was well below that states required of stock price Based on a share Apple was selling at book value Basically under Massachusetts regulation at the time the share could be sold no more than each In addition Massachusetts limited stock prices to x price to earnings for the most recent fiscal years That means Apple would have had to price its IPO at a share to meet state requirements A lot of other states had strict laws on new issues which prevented Apple from offering the stock Since it seems that investors attitude toward lofty pricetoearnings ratios for young promising technology companies didnt change much Investors back then were looking for the next hot issue or then called Xeroxes named after the company Xerox XRX an original NiftyFifty glamour stock in the early s This was one year after the famous cover of BusinessWeek titled The Death of Equities which eventually proved a vivid contrary indicator Apple was selling well above x PE or about x s earnings of an estimated cents per share You can say that Apple grew into its multiple To better understand the context Robert Metz from the New York Times reported this in his article Consider Apple Computer surely one of the Horatio Alger stories of our time This young company specializes in the manufacture and sale of computer terminals for home use At a time when experts are predicting a terminal in every home Apple has captured the imagination of Wall Street and the investing public as well Apple Computer a small company relative to most listed on the New York Stock Exchange is carrying a total market capitalization of billion or more than WarnerLamberts billion or St Regis Papers billion though not quite so much as Sonys billion A professional investor who is not at liberty to be quoted finds Apple seriously overpriced and compares it with its rival Tandy He notes that Apples computer terminals are sold through independent retail stores that offer the terminals of competitors as well Meanwhile Tandy has of its own stores including that offer computers only From Market Place What Price Technology By Robert Metz Published January in The New York Times First I honestly had to google Tandy and it turns out to be a pretty long story according to Wikipedia Tandy was a leather goods store that ended up acquiring RadioShack RSH in Well Im familiar with RadioShack since its my favorite place to go every time I need a soldering iron Tandy was one of three companies along with Commodore International and Apple that started the personal computer revolution in It was reported that at the time of the IPO Apple lagged behind Tandy in sales of personal computers We know how this story ends Apple is now worth billion and RadioShack filed for Chapter However RadioShack has a slight advantage over the Apple store you dont need to wait in line at the cash register to get an Apple charger As to the other companies mentioned in the clipping above WarnerLambert was a pharmaceutical company that was acquired by Pfizer NYSE PFE and St Regis Papers was acquired by The Champion International Corporation in Below is an enlargement of the news clip above As you can see Steve Jobs is the largest shareholder followed by AC Markkula Jr who provided early financing of to Apple Venrock is the venture capital arm of the Rockerfeller family Theres one name in particular that caught my attention Thats Henry E Singleton the cofounder of Teledyne Inc one of Americas most successful conglomerates Hes also featured in the outstanding book the Outsiders by William Thorndike which highlights master capital allocators Mr Singleton happened to be a director of the company and was a primary financial backer of the company in Source The New York Times December First Business Page Part Beside Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak a littleknown fact is that Apple had a third cofounder his name was Ron Wayne Mr Wayne was twice as old as both Steves and was supposed to be the adult in the newly formed partnership However two weeks later he sold his stake in the company for and then put all his savings in gold Bloomberg documented the episode He also drew the first company logo depicting Sir Isaac Newton sitting beneath an apple tree The chart above has years of data As you can see Apples monstrous gain happened in the last ten years For a x bagger the company looked mostly uninvestable for the large majority of its existence In the s Apple was working hard at piercing the market and coming out with new products It was going head to head with tough competition such as IBM NYSE IBM Apple II was a success but Apple III didnt turn out too well and was discontinued in As promising as it looked the Lisa computer also was a flop In we saw the debut of the Macintosh the peoples computer The Macintosh had strong sales but the company was struggling with internal problems In a boardroom showdown got Steve Jobs ousted from the company Jobs and several other executives left and founded a new computer company called NeXT Inc which would later be an Apple competitor The second half of the decade was marked by expansion operational problems and a reorganization The stock still managed much higher than its IPO price of adjusted for splits Through much of the s Apples shares went nowhere until You have to remember that Apple was at one point on the verge of bankruptcy Apple suffered from mismanagement as one CEO after another faltered miserably In Steve Jobs came back to rescue the company When he returned to the company years after being ousted by the board Apple had run up billion in losses over two years Apple was days away from bankruptcy Jobs would later say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT of all the companies had to come to Apples rescue with a million investment YouTube In the iMac came out and Apple finally turned a profit Investors took notice as the chart above demonstrates In the iPod first Generation was released and you know the rest of the story Then came the iPods iPads iPhones iMacs iBooks iTunes and the Apple Stores Its labeled as one of the greatest comebacks in corporate history The rewards were high so was the risk The turning point in the stock chart is in when the stock started its exponential meteoric rise The year also coincided with iTunes turning oneyearold and grabbing market share of legal downloaded music In Apple hit another homerun with the release of the iPhone that dethroned BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY for smartphone market share The iPhone revolutionized the mobile industry The iPhone became Apples most profitable product and brought the company great gains The verdict here is that even though its easy to point out at how much money you would have made with your Apple shares its not the example to use when bringing up the buy and hold strategy Apple should be categorized in the best turnaround situation Unless you were a MacAddict remember those investors didnt really have any business investing in Apple until around From to today Apple wasnt an attractive buy and hold considering what investors had to go through for the first twenty years Its only really in the last years and mostly near the mids that it was really worth buying and sitting on the shares Steve Jobs had to come back and restructure the company before it became investable Apple managed to reinvent itself into a much better company one of the most regarded in the world Apple released musthave products before customers would even know they would want it Innovation and thinking differently has been a key component in Apples second coming Its amazing how much technology has changed Normally Apple would be considered old tech up there with IBM Xerox NYSE XRX and HP NYSE HPQ among others But Apple has been able to reinvent itself into one most admirable companies right there with the new tech guys like Facebook NASDAQ FB and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apple went from super cool late ss to near death s back to super cool snow Apple is one of the companies that reshaped the world we live in Whats next for Apple With all due respect to Tim Cook Steve Jobs was irreplaceable How different and inferior would our technology be today if Steve Jobs had not shepherded the development of the iPod iPhone iPad and iTunes store Other than updating the legacy products phone tablets etc Apple hasnt released a new slam dunk product Theres something to do with wearable devices but its more of a gadget for now During the s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows took over the world and it looked unmovable from its throne Like I said technology can change really fast Change happens gradually but it will look as if it happened suddenly Apple is doing well in the shortrun without Steve Jobs its the long run thats more uncertain Apple almost went extinct so it probably knows better than anybody how important it is to innovate For the last decade Apple has been about releasing the best products and creating new markets where there wasnt a demand before Will it be able to do that same thing in years or will it play catch up like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>did in the s Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
