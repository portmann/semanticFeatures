paying US income tax on repatriation Apple has issued bonds repeatedly since initiating its share repurchase program including in nonUS currencies On recent quarterly calls analysts have asked about Apple Incs NASDAQ AAPL foreign currency headwinds and their effect on Apples finances Exposure to nonoperational factors such as currency exchange rates poses a risk not only to the impact of foreign earnings as measured in US dollars but the value in US dollars of Apples foreignheld cash This article discusses both Apples operational ability to maintain margins in the recent foreign exchange environment and Apples effectiveness in using foreignissued debt as a tax planning tool Although Apple remains a premium brand that commands top dollar for products it has internally transformed itself to a highvolume manufacturer with tight control on its unit costs Apples CEO Tim Cook has in fact described himself as the Attila the Hun of inventory Among Apples greatest advantages in competition is Apples superior margins Low perunit costs allow Apple to present competition at every price point it likes without fear that competitors can earn enough to present credible competition for the bulk of its business Ownership of key technologies the iPhones chip design and the Unixbased operating systems at the heart of all its products allows Apple to amortize fixed development costs across growing global unit sales preserving margins advantages over competitors who must acquire key technologies from third parties and share their associated revenues Nevertheless commentators continue to predict that Apples first mover advantage will fade and with it Apples margins This view falsely assumes that cell phones or even smartphones were a field so new Apple could have had a firstmover advantage when it entered the market in But lets look at the trend line in operating margins Nokia NYSE NOK and BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY have operating margins less than Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corp NASDAQ MSFT bought Nokias handset business in its margins are dominated by software licensing in market segments like servers and tools desktop operating systems and application software Only the software companies on the chart <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google Corp NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL enjoy operating margins that like Apples are in the double digits But the year chart doesnt show Apple losing its margins advantage Rather it shows Apple pulling ahead even of its software vendor competitors Apple is the blue line with the top number So its not a great surprise that when foreign exchange headwinds were predicted to eat up to basis points of Apples worldwide gross margin which was anticipated to keep Apples gross margins between and for the Marchending quarter Apple managed nevertheless to raise gross margins to for the quarter Because Apple owns so much of the intellectual property in its products most competitors buy thirdparty CPUs for highend phones instead of contracting fabricators to make their own designs Apple keeps more of the revenue it generates from every device Apple has grown rather than lost its margins advantage In expanding its cash return program to billion Apple recently announced that in addition to increasing its dividend its also adding billion to its share repurchase authorization Onlookers see Tim Cook retiring of Apples outstanding shares A limiting factor in Apples repurchase program has been the location of its earnings Most of Apples billion cash on hand is located offshore where it was earned Since the exchanges on which Apple shares trade are in the US Apple cant buy the shares without repatriating the money and in the process subjecting it to elevated US income tax rates Applying a tax haircut to Apples offshore aftertax cash would run against shareholder interest by decreasing Apples assets When share buybacks reduce cash onhand they also reduce the share count so each investor holds a bigger piece of the company Volunteering for avoidable taxes offers no similar virtue Apple could certainly spend foreignheld cash on foreignsited purchases like the companys recent acquisition of the German augmented reality software firm Metaio but theres just not hundreds of billions in good acquisition deals that fit Apples product roadmap Apple gets better performance pitting foreign assembler suppliers against one another in bidding wars than owning them The Apple Stores now in China dont cost that much The fact is Apple is raking in cash faster than it can spend it building its business and keeping idle capital on the books helps nobody Repurchases dont change Apples results as a firm but nevertheless improve performance for shareholders Repurchases reduce the capital with which Apple its earns its revenues and reduce the denominator by which all Apples pershare metrics are calculated The result is better capital performance and superior pershare metrics each nonselling shareholder owns a bigger and bigger fraction of the whole firm as repurchases continue As previously described here its this kind of sharecount reduction that Berkshire Hathaways NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB Chairman Warren Buffett anticipated following his firms purchase of of the outstanding shares of International Business Machines Inc NYSE IBM The point of loving share repurchases was to own even more of a worthy target company down the road without spending a cent See Buffetts letter to shareholders at p The repurchases suggest Tim Cook appreciates the advice Warren Buffett gave Steve Jobs when the latter explained Apple wouldnt have opportunities to deploy significant amounts of its cash to acquire productive assets Selling bonds abroad gives Apple foreign cash that Apple can turn into dollars and spend in the US without paying income tax on it because its not profit They are loan proceeds Comparing Apples interest rate to its tax rate makes the transaction look cheap especially when one considers some of the rates Apple pays Last year Apples twopart Swiss Franc issuance bore interest rates of and Apples recent Yen issuance paid only By taking debt in foreign currencies Apple also removes some volatility from its balance sheet every quarter Apples SECcompliancedriven GAAP accounting disclosures value Apples cash and debt in USdollar terms irrespective of Apples localcurrency performance By offsetting nondollar assets with nondollar debt Apple removes some foreign exchange volatility from its quarterly performance measurement By reducing the impact of foreign exchange on Apples quarterly performance measurements Apple concentrates the performance metrics on Apples performance which for Apple is a good thing The concern that Apples competitors are catching up to it by selling software that better leverages available hardware sounds terrible until one considers that most Android customers dont have software current enough to enjoy Androids supposed new advantages and notice that Samsungs Galaxy S Edge costs Samsung more to make than the iPhone its designed to attack Samsung cant possibly price its premium product at a point that would prevent Apples profits without joining the mass of moneylosing handset makers Apple has left in the dust As explained before Samsung may sell more raw units but Apples ownership of the most valuable IP in each device gives Apple better margins and more profit in every unit it sells Although Apple Pay quickly became the most popular mobile payment system at Whole Foods Market Inc NASDAQ WFM Apples new services revenue stream has yet to demonstrate its potential The disappointment Apples customers perceive in stores when trying to use Apple Pay turns out to be disappointment with the speed with which stores roll out the technology needed to make contactless payment systems work in the US Apples upcoming UK Apple Pay rollout should provide information on Apples success in the field compared to competitors contactless payment in the UK has been up and running for years Apple Pay supports the cards that conduct most of the US purchase volume but making it practically available to retailers worldwide will take time Once Apple Pay is widely available to retailers theres no reason Apple should not work to build the business into the worlds largest payment processor Apples position in enterprise hardware has been pretty poor over the years with Apple dropping server hardware unexpectedly and not bothering to deliver backend tools intended to administer large installations Now that the Apple Store supplies so much software and International Business Machines Inc has begun rolling out enterprise software for Apple products the moves needed to make Apple a serious Enterprise player are much easier to see Already a Fortune favorite in mobile devices and the world leader in highend desktops and notebooks Apple is now cracking the corporate desktop world with IBMs Mac decision to allow employees to select a Mac as easily as its competitors as a primary workstation At Cisco Systems Inc NASDAQ CSCO a similar decision led to Mac share among companyowned notebooks Since Apple doesnt sell lossleader hardware and runs the store through which its easiest to track software licenses and installation versions a huge share jump in hardware could have ripple effects in Apples nonhardware businesses Apples margins advantage shows little evidence of succumbing to the faddish slump naysayers have predicted since the year after the iPhone launched and its plan to repurchase shares promises to improve pershare metrics so as to multiply the disparity between the ratio of its price per share and its earnings per share and the PE of the SP at date of this article Trading unproductive cash for a smaller denominator in all Apples pershare metrics is good for all who hold shares and doing it with money not taxed at US tax rates is cheaper than doing it with dollars already taxed at the highest possible rate Moreover adding nondollar debt allows Apple to cancel some of the foreign exchange volatility created by its significant nonUS cash holdings Apples share repurchases are sensible shareholderfriendly and will magnify the pershare result of Apples strategic gains as it expands its addressable market with more stores strategic relationships and a growing global services business Using cheap debt to finance share retirement while Apples PE lags the broader market will turbocharge future pershare performance
