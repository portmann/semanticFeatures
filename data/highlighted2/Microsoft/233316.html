class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Also Might Win The Enterprise Hardware Sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha The pricey enterprisecentric Surface Book and Surface Pro are selling well The Surface laptops have no real rival The new iPad Pro is just an oversized very expensive iPad with upgraded specs I already discussed the reasons why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is winning the enterprise software market over Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL As long as Apple cannot improve its iWork software suite Tim Cook will never see Apple crush <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>with business customers I now would like to discuss the importance of Microsofts aggressive push for the Surface Book and Surface Pro We should not worry about the dip in Surface sales during the last quarter The clients only held out for the Surface Pro Microsofts new laptop is still seeing short supply due to strong market demand Going forward I suggest investors should instead take into account that Microsofts longterm hardware strategy future is better because Apple and Google are not directly addressing the obvious advantages of the Surface Book and Surface Pro I reiterate my position that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>laptops are targeted toward displacingreducing the presence of Chromebooks MacBooks and iPads in the enterprise market The strong focus on the topnotch build quality and highend hardware components makes the Surface Book the ultimate enterprise laptop Apple will release the new iPad Pro this week However the incompatibility of the ARMbased iPad Pro with current custom xonly enterprisecommercial software makes it a weak equalizer to the Surface Pro Below are the reasons why I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a strong chance to eventually dominate the enterprise mobile computer market Apple continues to reject the idea of a Mac OS X tabletnotebook version of the iPad As long as Apples management team sticks to their product differentiation principle MacBooks without touchscreen displays are endangered species among business users Unlike what Tim Cook is proclaiming few IT managers will buy the iPad Pro in bulk because it really is not a laptop replacement product Cooks claim that the iPad Pro could kill the PCnotebook is a sales pitch hyperbole It runs contrary to current enterprise market reality As what the Surface Pro has demonstrated since last year the future of the business laptop is to transform itself into a hybrid tabletnotebook product A modern corporate mobile computer also should complement touchenabled industrystandard software like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office Intuit QuickBooks Photoshop and AutoCAD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shareholders should be happy that Apple is making a mistake not acknowledging that enterprise IT managerspurchasers are not ordinary consumers IT managers are under tight budget reviews that require them to only buy new computers that offer the best bang for the buck Compared to the versatility and usability of an Surface Pro the plus iPad Pro is a bad investment for any business or ordinary user I also opine that Google is now a little confused with its alleged plan to merge Chrome OS inside the Android OS I originally thought that Google built Chrome OS to compete with Linux Windows and Mac OS X in the desktop computer segment I like the upcoming Google Pixel C Android laptop However I fear that Androids persistent security vulnerabilities make Android computers impracticalunacceptable for business users The content created and stored in enterprise computers often involves secret information that IT managers would loath to get exposed to the security bugs of the opensource Android operating system Unless Google buys the Certicom encryption assets of BlackBerry and make them free for Android devices the thought of Android computers inside corporate offices is almost implausible Google and its PC OEM partners will likely stick to Chromebooks Unlike Android OS the browserbased Chrome OS computers come with builtin and automaticallyupdated antivirus malware protection sandbox app protection and data encryption Fortunately for Microsofts Surface computer business campaign Chromebooks for enterprise may not repeat its success in the US market education system Like I said before the other requirement for a modern business laptop is that it should be compatible with industrystandard and custommade x only software A Chrome OS computers Achilles heel is that it needs virtualization software to make it run Windowsonly software IT managers will not find it prudent to spend more money for virtualization software just to make Chromebooks compatible with their companys current software portfolio More than a year after Google and VMWare NYSE VMW announced their partnership to make Chromebooks more palatable to enterprise customers Chromebook sales to the enterprise remain low The added cost of commercial virtualization software like the VMWare Horizon makes a Chrome OS computer only a minor threat to the enterprisecentric Surface BookSurface Pro Google could only increase its chances to succeed in the enterprise market if it imitates the decision of Xiaomi to create a custom Linux laptop Unlike Chrome OS theres a free emulator called WINE that lets people run some Windowsspecific software on Linux computers I exited MSFT when it hit above but longterm investors should continue to hold on to their shares Google and Apples inability to address the growing threat of Surface computers compels me to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will dominate the highend enterprise laptop market pretty soon The in form factor versatility of the Surface Book and Surface Pro makes them the ideal computers for highlymobile businesscreative professionals The under inches display sizes of the Surface Book and Surface Pro means they belong to the growing Ultrabook laptop category Statista is predicting that Ultrabooks will take of notebook sales this year I therefore see the Surface also appealing outside the enterprise market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might just achieve what HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY have achieved Unless Apple changes its policy and release a touchenabled MacBook I see the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface computers eventually dethroning the MacBook Air from its leadership position in Ultrabook computer sales The twopronged approach of supplying the hardware and software needs of enterprise clients is a great tactic Theres billion people using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office By selling highmargin Windows computers to business users <span
