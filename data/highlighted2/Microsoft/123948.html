class='textDiv'>Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>After Its Bad Earnings Report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha In alltoopredictable fashion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is selling off after its quarterly earnings even though the core results were quite strong Investors are succumbing to shortterm thinking and selling the stock based on Microsofts large Nokia writedown But this is not news and was fully expected Meanwhile Microsofts core strategic objectives specifically its shift into highervalue cloud businesses remains fully on track And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is seeing strong results across other businesses like tablets and the Xbox As a result the last thing investors should do right now is sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Instead the stock is a compelling buy Shares of technology giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQ MSFT fell after the company reported quarterly earnings even though the results were largely as expected Actually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>beat on adjusted earnings per share and revenue What dragged the company down was its huge write down based on its restructuring But again this was already known There wasnt much of anything that should have surprised investors and caused irrational selling but thats exactly what happened To me this is a perfect example of Wall Streets shortterm mentality While the sellside analysts are constantly obsessed with companies meeting quarterly targets from a longterm perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is doing everything it needs to do to position itself for future growth Downsizing and restructuring its phone business is the proper course of action as is shifting focus toward the cloud As a result I remain very bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and if anything investors should use this drop as a buying opportunity On the surface Microsofts results look bad The company recorded a massive billion net loss but this was due entirely to the billion impairment charge related to the Nokia device acquisition Including the restructuring total charges reached billion Excluding all these charges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would have earned per share That would have represented yearoveryear growth so put differently Microsofts results were quite strong excluding the Nokia writedown As it pertains to the Nokia mess while the huge writedown is shocking because of the massive numbers involved its worth repeating that this is not news <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>previously announced its major writeoff and the subsequent impact on earnings Its painful in the short term but long term this is exactly the right thing to do Microsofts Nokia acquisition was quite simply a bad decision It hasnt worked out the Lumia is not a serious player in the mobile phone industry Rather than continue to invest time and resources in a failed idea Id much rather see a company admit its mistake do what is necessary to right the wrong and move on Excellent Results In Microsofts Growth Businesses While Wall Street panics about the huge writeoff meanwhile Microsofts businesses of the future are firing on all cylinders For example cloud revenue soared or excluding foreign exchange and reached an annualized rate that exceeds billion due to the continued success of Office Azure and Dynamics Even on the consumer and devices side things were simply not as bad as they seem Windows revenue fell but this is likely due to the upcoming release of Windows which is causing delayed PC sales Surface revenue grew yearoveryear as the Surface Pro continues to sell very well Xbox revenue increased and last but not least search revenue rose as Bing captured an additional basis points of search share year over year There is little sense to me in selling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now At per share the stock trades for a very reasonable times enterprise value to EBITDA and times forward EPS estimates This is especially true considering the companys excellent financial position and cash flow generation Despite the huge writedown that captured the news headlines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>generated billion of free cash flow last quarter and billion of free cash flow in fiscal All that cash is piling up on the balance sheet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now holds billion in cash shortterm investments and longterm investments up from billion this point last year Also remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is one of only three US companies to hold the tripleA credit rating from Standard Poors With its tremendous cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>returns a lot of cash to shareholders The company bought back billion of stock and paid another billion of dividends The dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of per year over the past five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is due to raise its dividend again later this year and Im fully expecting another doubledigit increase Thanks to the drop after hours the stock yields a very attractive I dont currently own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but would love to start a position soon A continued selloff based on what I believe are irrational fears is exactly what Im hoping for As the stock goes down its future return potential goes up as does its dividend yield Thats why Im praying for Microsofts panic selling to continue into the low range so I can buy this fantastic company at a bargain price Source Buy
