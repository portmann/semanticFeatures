class='textDiv'>News Sites Consider Moving Their Content Inside Facebook Because That Worked So Well In The AOL Era Consumerist Theres news in the world of news today as some major sites are on the cusp of a new publishing deal with Facebook The deal would actively keep their content inside of Facebook rather than having links on everyones lovetohateit social network lead back out to other companies respective websites But there is one specific lesson this deal highlights even on the internet you cant escape the cycles of history Somehow everything old will be new again The New York Times reports that BuzzFeed National Geographic and the New York Times are likely to be the launch partners for Facebooks new program The NYT report about the NYT spoke to people with knowledge of the discussions and does not consider the deal officially confirmed A representative for the NYT declined to speak to the NYT The New York Times launched its website just under twenty years ago on January And now years after the NYT took its first steps onto the web it may be starting to retreat back off At the time the NYT wrote that the electronic newspaper being put onto the web was part of a strategy to extend the readership of The Times and to create opportunities for the company in the electronic media industry Before launching their website the NYT had maintained a digital presence on AOL the dominant ISP of the s That space called times decades before Twitter sprinted away with that format began operating in But to the paper of record breaking out of AOLs platform and onto the world wide web meant finally being able to go worldly and wide in every sense It was a prime opportunity to go global and reach ie sell advertising to everyone The Web sites global audience means a larger potential readership than that of times which is limited to America Onlines subscribers currently more than four million The Times trajectory through the era is a familiar one many companies took a similar path into and then out of the early locked ISPs Digital space evolved before the thing we now think of as the public internet did In the late s and early s from the modern point of view there basically was no internet Connections were direct you dialed into a specific message board server or service Services like CompuServe Prodigy and AOL were walled gardens Expansive ones but isolated just the same You dialed in specifically to AOL to access their material Saying you could find NBC News online on AOL at keyword NBC wasnt just a marketing partnership at the time it was literally the place to find NBC News online And then in we got the World Wide Web and a remarkable piece of generalpurpose software with which to access it the browser Netscape Navigator and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Internet Explorer kicked off at the end of and the middle of respectively and everyone ran out and staked a claim on some small slice of internet territory It was a land rush in the western frontier writ global Individuals and businesses alike bought up domains set up shop and tried to figure out just what the heck a website was really for A few years after that two doctoral students at Stanford launched a research project that would become Google A coupleyears farther along on the opposite coast a Harvard undergrad thought fellow students would like his site The Facebook Another year or two down the line and engineers at Apple thought what if we put the iPod and a cell phone into the same device And so the entire online environment and all the players in it have changed We now face a digital landscape more like than like in many ways Consumers are increasingly using mobile devices for their access and that means coming to sites and services through a variety of limiteduse narrowscope apps One app for your local news channel Another for the NYT A third for Facebook A fourth for sports information And so on to infinity The appification of the internet has taken users and content companies back away from the browser and into a series of controlled and curated environments The digital strategies change but the net effects and concerns for consumers are remarkably familiar What happens ifone company in this instance Facebook becomes not just the de facto gatekeeper to the worlds news but the literal one Facebook of course gets to benefit But it might be rocky going for everyone else The new proposal by Facebook carries another risk for publishers the loss of valuable consumer data When readers click on an article an array of tracking tools allow the host site to collect valuable information on who they are how often they visit and what else they have done on the web That data might instead go to Facebook which like many companies uses that information itself to target and track consumers more effectively for advertisers and which has been subject to criticisms over its privacy policies It has not been disclosed how much of that data Facebook would be willing to share And if Facebook pushes beyond the experimental stage and makes content hosted on the site commonplace those who do not participate in the program could lose substantial traffic a factor that has played into the thinking of some publishers Their articles might load more slowly than their competitors and over time readers might avoid those sites Net neutrality means that the owner of your internet wires cant mess with the traffic you request through them but neither it nor any other rule says anything about internet publishers who manage content If the number one way consumers access news links is through Facebook and it more or less is then keeping those consumers inside Facebook and speeding up the news delivered inside Facebook is a way for Facebook to make Facebook not only more attractive but more necessary for internet content companies Click to print Opens in new window Facebooks Next Big
