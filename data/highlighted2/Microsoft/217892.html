and other chipmakers reacted sharply as a result The Germanybased semiconductors company Dialog Semiconductor OTCDLGNF reported its preliminary results for Q Monday with lower than expected Q revenues and weak Q guidance as presented in the table below Dialogs stock price reacted sharply to the disappointing results declining more than on the Frankfurt stock exchange on Monday and an additional on Tuesday Dialogs performance directly impacts two companies Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Atmel NASDAQ ATML Apple is impacted since Dialog is a main supplier of power management chips for the iPhone and iPad and Apple is its largest customer to date Atmel is impacted in light of the expected acquisition in which some of the payment will be through Dialogs shares Apples stock price fell on investors concerns that Dialogs guidance implies that Apple will release weaker earnings today after the market is closed As Dialogs results came just a couple of days before Apples reports its Q earnings investors use that as a proxy for Apples iPhone sales performance and outlook That link drove down stock prices of other Apple suppliers like Skyworks NASDAQ SWKS Qorvo NASDAQ QRVO Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM Even though this event might signal a slowdown in Apples cash machine iPhone I remain bullish on Apple in light of its enterprise initiatives led by the iPad Pro as well as the partnerships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and IBM NYSE IBM to support the corporate ecosystem As I mentioned in an earlier article I believe Apple will gain a significant market share in the mobileelectronic payments market with the Apple Pay service and will be able to drive transaction costs down while increasing incoming transaction fees Also I believe it will be able to generate substantial revenues from TV and Music initiatives All of these factors should be taken into consideration before selling the stock based on one suppliers performanceguidance Atmels stock price fell since part of the payment expected from Dialog will be made through Dialogs shares which creates a direct link between Atmels share price and Dialogs share price until the deal is closed and executed The price Dialog has agreed to pay for acquiring Atmel is in cash and of Dialog American Depository Stock ADS which values the deal at per Atmel share This amount is significantly lower than the price mentioned in the original announcement from Sep but still higher than Atmels current price I remain bullish on Atmel in light of the expected deal and its strong positioning in the IoT market as presented in an earlier article Even though Dialogs results may indicate a slowdown in iPhone sales and thats a big may and a drastic emotional reaction is expected and reasonable these days when the market is unstable I believe most of the chipmakers were oversold Apples suppliers that were down yesterday went south on the sole belief that they will be significantly impacted by an iPhone sales decline however Dialogs case dont have to be the case for every supplier Apple has its own needs and inventory build that could drive different demands from different suppliers Lets not forget that Apple might be a very important supplier for many chipmakers but Apple is not the only smartphonesconsumer electronics company in the market and not all suppliers will be significantly impacted from a potential iPhone slowdown Before selling one of the chipmakers investors should evaluate these chipmakers entire portfolio revenue streams and growth potential I believe its important to stick to the facts and not to rush to liquidate positions I agree that Atmel is less attractive right now after the Dialog price correction however it is still a leading IoT chip supplier The dialog might experience lower than expected demand from Apple but the implication for Apples performance or Qualcomm for example is far from an immediate direct impact I remain bullish on both Apple and Atmel for the moment Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with
