via TheAntiMediaorg The FBI versus Apple Inc An unstoppable force meets an immovable object the feverish momentum of American technocracy accelerating into the cavernous Orwellian entrenchment of the surveillance state You thought the patent wars were intense The Battle of the Backdoor pits one of Americas most monolithic tech conglomerates against the Department of Justice and ultimately the interests of the national security state And this case is likely only the opening salvo in what will be a decadeslong ideological war between tech privacy advocates and the federal government On its face the case boils down to a single locked and encrypted iPhone S used by radical jihadist Syed Rizwan Farook before he and his wide Tashfeen Malik killed people in San Bernardino on December nd The DOJ wants Apple to build a backdoor into the device so that it can bypass the companys state of the art encryption apparatus and access information and evidence related to the case At least thats the premise presented to the public As we are learning the FBI and the federal government have a far more comprehensive endgame in mind than merely bolstering the prosecution of this one case Whistleblower Edward Snowden tweeted last week that crucial details of the case are being obscured by officialsSpecifically he made the following trenchant points Now the Wall Street Journal has confirmed that there are actually other iPhones the FBI wants to access in cases that have nothing to do with terrorism According to an Apple lawyer these cases are spread all across the country Four in Illinois three in New York two in California two in Ohio and one in Massachusetts With each of these cases the FBIs lawyers cite an thcentury law called All Writs Act which they say is the jurisprudence needed to force Apple to comply and bypass their builtin proprietary encryption methods Is it any wonder the only case the public hears about is the one that involves terrorism While law enforcement authorities claim these additional cases are evidence that encryption has become a major hindrance to investigations across the country privacy advocates say it is conversely evidence that national security is not the only factor at play in the governments desire to circumvent encryption This is further evidenced by the fact that the government has been pressuring Apple to create iPhone backdoors since long before the San Bernardino attack Rather information privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF say the push for bypassing encryption specifically compelling Apple to build a backdoor operating system involves a largescale campaign to use the threat of terror to overreach their legal authority breaching civil liberties in the process We saw this in the wake of when NSAs PRISM program conscripted Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Facebook in a covert data mining campaign to collect metadata from American citizens The EFF says the Apple case is part of an ongoing pattern of the state using the threat of terrorism as a Trojan horse to get backdoor access to citizens smartphones The power to force a company to undermine security protections for its customers may seem compelling in a particular case but this weeks order has very significant implications both for technology and the law Not only would it require a company to create a new vulnerability potentially affecting millions of device users the order would also create a dangerous legal precedent The next time an intelligence agency tries to undermine consumer device security by forcing a company to develop new flaws in its own security protocols the government will find a supportive case to cite where before there were none The DOJ deployed talking heads to all the media outlets to make the specious argument that what theyre asking for doesnt really constitute a backdoor The fact of the matter is they are asking for a court to mandate that Apple work for the government which some have argued creates a th amendment violation as well as privacy concerns in weakening their own security and creating access to a locked encrypted device This is a backdoor and virtually all tech experts agree that they are dangerous Nate Cardozo explained on the PBS NewsHour Authoritarian regimes around the world are salivating at the prospect of the FBI winning this order If Apple creates the master key that the FBI has demanded that they create governments around the world are going to be demanding the same access Computer programming expert and Libertarian Party presidential candidate John McAfee tried to call the FBIs bluff last week by offering to take apart the San Bernardino iPhone and help the government extract the data they want without building a backdoor He made the rounds on major media outlets as well warning of the dangers of complying with the Justice Department McAfee says the FBI is asking every owner of an iPhone to make their phone susceptible to bad hackers and more importantly foreign enemies of the United States like China Meanwhile this week Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg offered intellectual solidarity with Apples CEO Tim Cook while Bill Gates took a more moderate stance on the issue suggesting privacy advocates were overreacting Gates later backslid from this position and lent his support to Apple Its also worth pointing out that the FBIs own mistakes during the investigation of the San Bernardino shooting may the reason they now need Apples help According to Truthdig The FBI reportedly asked San Bernardino County officials to tamper with the iCloud account of one of the suspected shooters in last Decembers attack in an effort that ultimately failed making it impossible to know if there were other ways of recovering encrypted information without taking Apple to court Apples brand is on the line too Previously hailed as a data security juggernaut among smartphone manufacturers a judicial order to build a backdoor would compromise their status in a market in which uncompromised encryption is becoming rarer by the day The stakes couldnt be higher As noted by The Pontiac Tribune if the FBI prevails in this case the ramifications wont be limited to smartphones It will set a precedent for the government legally conscripting any and every entity they desire for the purposes of citizen surveillance and metadata collection After the bell we hear news from The New York Times that APPLE SAID TO BE WORKING ON IPHONE THAT IT CANT EVEN HACK Wed Cognitive Dissonance Apple wishes to appear to be the staunch defender of your right to privacy And the NSA wishes people to believe their phones arent already hacked Wed BuddyEffed Wed Bollixed Wed JuliaS Its a tug of war between governments and corporations where each side wants to monopolize its access to data Corporations want to control you and influence the government The government wants to control you and influence corporations Apple has made a tracking device with which millions of people willingly police themselves Apple has control over millions of minds and wallets Government also wants control over minds and wallets but only knows how to achieve goals through force so it applies force onto Apple as it is not smart enough to invent and build its own mass surveillance devices people would buy Wed MissCellany I know its a small thing to ask butis it possible for once just once to have a presidential candidate who is as at least as intelligent and liberty minded as the average ZH reader Wed JuliaS Id love to see the president go on TV after a stock market crash and instead of reassuring the public address the banking community with Jump you fuckers Wed Fred Garvin If Apple could just steal the industrial strength hard drive shredding recycling technology used by the rogue agents within the IRS why none of this would be an issue Wed Jim in MN The NSA and DHS need to be defunded and dismantled They are serious dangers to the US and global populace Let Eurasia stew in its own fascist juices Get our Republic back and let investment and innovation do the rest Sure a hard decade during the Great Reset But its the only way Wed Cognitive Dissonance If the only way means ripping power from those who already employ it the great reset will be delayed as long as possible Or at least until the explosive force is so large people will beg to be chained in the bowels of the Roman Galley for the promise of three meals a day and and a limit of lashes a week We say desperate men do desperate things We are beyond the point of no return That said the powers that be want to leverage the system so far that those most likely to be harmed the plebs of the world will beg for enslavement in return for three hots and a cot We are less than a generation away for near middle age feudal conditions for the lower classes all monitored and managed by modern technology of course A good strong EMP the world over would take care of things Wed knukles Wed Government need Wed CHoward As much as I dislike Apple I stand with Apple on this one This is way beyond that ONE iPhone The ramifications are huge in this case Wed FredFlintstone Isnt this all theater Are we to believe that the spooks need Tim Cook to assist them in cracking this phone They probably did it already and found something that they would like to divulge or they are just trying to bust Apples balls in the court of public opinion for some other reason Wed Lumberjack Wed KirkNCC They just dont have enough resources and bandwidth to cope with NoTech This is EXACTLY what all crooks and jihadists will do a Hide in plain site leading a boring vanilla life engaged in community b Lead a hidden life where Comm is done in person via Old Tradecraft Its so obvious that its a shame that the lazy asses at the FBI cant figure it out Which brings us back to the CORRECT NARRATIVE we need to have a Why TF are we CREATING jihadists with our Malicious Foreign Policy b When are we going to stop being the Shabbos Goy for the Globalist Zionists on whose behalf and for whose benefit we do all these political military and financial horrors Wed logically possible Foriegn Enemies like China With our govs track record Im much more concerned about our gov having this technology than China Wed thHorseman Wed malek Why didnt the FBI or some other three letter agency simply send a National Security Letter to Apple That wouldve been the most obvious way to go for Big Brother Wed thHorseman Then the criminals with badges will have to resort to the rubber hosing you Wed thHorseman Start downloading all of the legacy and current versions of all open source encryption programs and store them That way as time goes by you will know which versions are secure Wed Bennie Noakes Funny that Justice Scalia who wrote There is nothing new in the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all dies mysteriously just as this issue hits the courts and the FBI declines to investigate his death They are asking a private corporation to basically destroy its own privacy contract with their client when they say give us a code to crack ANY iphones contents Sayeeed Nutcase destroyed his own PERSONAL phones for a reason those had whatever could be termed as evidence on them This was his employers phone I highly doubt theres anything on it implicating hm or anyone else Its looking more more like your standard cuz were the gubmint and you should do it thats why to me another naked power grab Wed nmewn Im not ready to call it false flag because I do realize they are genuinely incompetent only relyig on the nature of their brute forceBUTit was really weird when Obama came right out afterwards yakking about people on No Fly lists being able to purchase guns I was likeWTF are you talking about He was an American citizen who just flew his nonAmerican fiance over hereON A PLANEand was permitted to do so with a visa Wed Cognitive Dissonance Wed Anopheles The information on that iPhone would have been very easy to access but the FBI changed the password and fracked themselves the San Bernardino Countys official Twitter account stated The County was working cooperatively with the FBI when it reset the iCloud password at the FBIs
