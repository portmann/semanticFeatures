just about everything bright green The Dow NYSEARCA DIA spiked more than points All three major indices were up precisely The SP NYSEARCA SPY had its largest gain in two months It was a uniformly successful day for the US equity markets The only losers of note on the day were some retailers And even that was due to the overwhelming surge in Amazon NASDAQ AMZN which soared more than to put in its firstever close above If you were short just about anything on the day you got run over Its been a demoralizing couple of months for anyone thats been fighting the run higher in stocks Im still skeptical of the rally and the markets ability to make new highs That said days like yesterday wear on a market skeptics resolve For those going long volatility NYSEARCA VXX NYSEARCA UVXY its been a rough time lately VXX dropped and UVXY on the day both to new alltime lows UVXY is now off its week high As I frequently note there are better options for betting against the market than volatility The US FTC has stepped in and successfully halted the proposed Staples NASDAQ SPLS and Office Depot NASDAQ ODP merger In a theoretical world where Amazon and WalMart NYSE WMT didnt exist these two firms would potentially have an extraordinarily large portion of the market for paper ink cartridges and binders Im toned down my libertarian political instincts over the years regardless this is the sort of absurd overreach of government power that makes it easy to mock the nanny state Prior to the ruling and the collapse in Office Depots shares afterhours the companies had a combined market cap of a measly billion A behemoth this was not Remember when the FTC ended up basically letting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT off without any meaningful consequence despite allegedly colluding against other browsers such as Netscape Well were not in that era anymore The pendulum has swung Office Depot is at present hardly even profitable Another idea behind dangerous monopolies are that they make excess profits Office Depot closed the day at a greater than PE ratio based on its sparkling million of net income last year Put another way neither Staples nor Office Depot is a reasonable threat of monopolizing anyone Remember when there were talks that Borders and Barnes Noble NYSE BKS might merge That would theoretically have created a bookselling monopoly in retail stores But it wouldnt have caused any harm to consumers in fact in the long run it probably would have helped them by keeping one stronger bookselling competitor to Amazon in place Similarly Office Depot and Staples really needed merger synergies to retain a viable competitive position going forward against Amazon and the cheap massretailers including WalMart and Costco NASDAQ COST Theres a good chance the FTCs action ends up causing Office Depot to go bankrupt eventually which will do nothing to save consumers money protect jobs or make the economy more efficient In all this is a horrendous ruling from the FTC And for investors considering other retail mergers consider that theres now a lot more risk in play Office Depot shares ended the afterhours session down with Staples also off Continuing with the Amazon crushing everything theme apparel retailers got smoked on Tuesday Its always fascinating to see what makes new week lows on days where the market is up strongly and vice versa The leaders to the downside were clothing retailers Gap NYSE GPS fell on a bad earnings result to a new week low L Brands NYSE LB continued its postearnings slide hitting new week lows on the session The Buckle NYSE BKE also joined the new lows party Others such as Macys NYSE M and Nordstrom NYSE JWN fell on the session and are near week lows as well So whats wrong with the sector One theory gaining credence is that millennials dont like mall apparel stores For example see this SA news bit In another sign of the problem that apparel stores are having in driving sales with millennials the new Global X Millennials Thematic ETF NASDAQ MILN has a top holding of Amazon and very little representation of apparel chain stock stocks LULU and LB make the list Another theory is that these companies are spending too much on share buybacks rather than reinvesting in their businesses Say what you will about Amazons lack of significant profitability the company is innovative and has no trouble finding and exploiting new opportunities Gap on the other hand has bought back of outstanding shares over the past four years almost all of them way above todays market price Not only has that taken capital away from the business its also provided lousy shareholder returns As Jeff Macke has theorized the Street is now starting to give a pass to companies such as Dicks NYSE DKS with hit or miss results that invest heavily in their business Unlike many of the other struggling retailers Dicks isnt just sending capital back to shareholders while allowing Amazon to take control of the future Finally one shouldnt rule out the simplest explanation The apparel retailers are selling off because has begun with a set of dismal retail sales figures generally The consumer is showing strain and this category of retail is hardhit by economic slowdowns I get the sense that the ills of the apparel industry go beyond simple economic slowdown but it likely plays a role I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this
