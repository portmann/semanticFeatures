company has also recruited ASUSTeK to create a sub Chrome OS dongle stick This should help Google increase Chromebooks market share in the US education system I thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT would be able to slow down the momentum of Chromebooks Google NASDAQ GOOG decided to intensify its campaign to defeat Windows computers in the US education sector The new Chromebooks from Chinese OEMs Haier and Hisense would compete with the alleged upcoming Microsofts Windows notebooks Google gets the earlybird advantage since the Haier Chromebook would be available by April while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will only release Windows by summer Chromebooks may not be able to play the most popular PC games like DoTA or League of Legends but they are very popular in the US According to Gartner the US education sector helped buy million Chromebooks in According to Future Source Consulting Chromebooks were the bestselling PCs for two consecutive quarters last year in the US K education market As per the chart from Future Source Consulting Chromebooks accounted for share in PCs sold to the US K education sector in Q Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Windows notebooks share are declining Tablets are also declining Only Chromebooks have consistently increase their share in the education market for the last four quarters The introduction of Chromebooks could accelerate the continuing decline of Windows PCs in the US education system Budgetconstrained school districts would probably succumb to the allure of Chromebooks Furthermore the Haier and Hisense Chromebooks are also ideal for emerging markets Schools in emerging countries have far less annual budgets than their US counterparts However the chart below from Future Source Consulting reveals that Chromebooks already had share of PCs shipped out to the global K education market Lowering the price tags of Chromebooks makes them very attractive to pricesensitive school administrators in emerging countries The company is also offering a free suite of apps to help teachers and students learn and work faster The education sector is a very important market for all PC vendors and success in the education market means the enterprise sector is just around the corner Once enterprise IT managers realize that Chromebooks could also work well in the corporate environment Chrome OS notebooks and desktop computers could dethrone officecentric Windows PCs The Chrome For Work initiative is Google targeting next Microsofts lucrative enterprise business Google has recruited VMware NYSE VMW and Citrix NASDAQ CTXS to let enterprise users run their Windowsonly apps on Chromebooks through virtualization Another major win for Google is that ASUSTeK OTCASUUY will soon release a Chrome OS computer dongle stick that will sell for less than The Asus Chromebit will connect to any TV or monitor via HDMI This is the same concept first unveiled by Intel NASDAQ INTC during CES However the Asus Chrome OS computer stick will be much cheaper since the Intel Windows Compute Stick will retail for Pricesensitive customers will likely prefer the Asus Chromebit over the Intel Compute Stick IT managers looking to save money will also appreciate the low perunit cost of the Chromebit in replacing older Windows or Windows XP desktop machines Googles search advertising and cloud services benefit from more users using Chrome OS computers Even K students are fair game for online display ads or links Surging sales of Chromebooks helps Google hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Apples sales to the K education market Success in the education market could lead to Chromebooks also invading the enterprise market Deploying and maintaining cheap Chrome OS desktops in schools is a test bed for Googles ambition to replace Windows PCs inside corporate offices The consumer is the ultimate winner in Googles quest to cure the worlds addiction to Windows computers Chromebooks could chip away at Windows dominance The world deserves another alternative to the Windows desktop OS Linux on desktop has been a dead horse since Aside from Apples Mac OS X Chrome OS is the only other viable computer operating system that has the backing of Google Intel and major PC manufacturers GOOG is a Buy Its longterm potential is very attractive The recent eMarketer report says Google will continue to dominate the billion global searchbased advertisements this year The search ads business will grow to a billion by and I not see any serious competition to Google The company as per eMarketers estimate will earn billion on net search ad revenue in This represents a global market share Baidu NASDAQ BIDU is second with and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is third with share Baidus success is largely due to Googles absence in China Google apparently is not too evil to quit its boycott of China Even though theres billion of advertising money in Chinas huge online population Google remains faithful to its decision to leave mainland China My Buy rating for Google is also supported by the predictive algorithm of I Know First Research The month and month scores of GOOG are both positive which means the stock is currently undervalued and offers the opportunity of future rewards Editors
