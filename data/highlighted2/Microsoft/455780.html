#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced a strategic partnership GE has other partnerships in the Industrial Internet Of Things industry but the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>partnership is a big deal On July General Electric NYSE GE announced a strategic partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT that will make GEs Predix platform available to users of Microsofts Azure cloud service The Predix platform is GEs cloudbased operating system for the Industrial Internet of Things IIoT and it is important to note that the platform is already receiving great praise from customers see this article for a highlevel understanding of the platform and for commentary on what Pitney Bowes NYSE PBI thinks of Predix This partnership is great news for both GE and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but in my opinion this partnership will especially go a long way towards showing the investment community that GE has fully solidified itself as the leader of an industry that has great growth potential Furthermore GE has done an excellent job creating partnerships with some of the biggest names in the technology industry but the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>partnership may prove to be the most beneficial in the long term Source GE Presentation Doorway to the Next Industrial Revolution The Industrial Internet The market opportunity that GE has with Predix is tremendous more on this below but this specific partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will help the company focus on customers that are not already covered by the partnerships identified in the slide above Moreover the GEMSFT partnership will give GE an opportunity in the near future to possibly increase the estimate for the already hefty goal of bringing in billion in digital revenue by up from the billion reported in and the billion estimated for In a February report Synergy Research Corp estimated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was number two in the public cloud market share but had the number one growth rate as of Q This shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a major player in cloud services so GE will have the opportunity to learn a thing or two from a team that has been able to significantly grow in the cloud industry over a short period of time Predix is not set to be available on Azure until the second quarter of but I believe the benefits will begin to set in later this year when analysts start to understand the longterm potential that GE has with IIoT and how these type of partnerships are putting the company three steps ahead of its competitors The IIoT is expected to rapidly grow over the next decade and many projections show that the industry will be a major force in the global economy Accenture provides great research and projections for this industry and the following estimate and quotes were highlighted in a recent report The IIoT spans industries representing percent of gross domestic product GDP among G nations including manufacturing mining agriculture oil and gas and utilities Many believe that the IIoT is just a way to improve operational efficiency but in todays environment companies can also benefit greatly by seeing it as a tool for finding growth in unexpected opportunities billion is a large number that is being thrown around and it is hard to put too much credence in a dollar figure for but what investors cannot deny is the fact that IIoT is a growing industry that will play a vital role for many years to come GE is working hard to set trends in the industry and with partnerships like the one announced with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the company is making major strides towards the goal of becoming the goto company in the industry Management is showing that they are committed to digital and that they are willing to invest now to prosper in the future Simply put digital is GEs future Satya Nadella <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO said it best Every industry and every company around the world is being transformed by digital technology GE was recently approved to remove the systemically important financial institution SIFI designation and this is important for several reasons but I want to highlight the two biggest reasons First as I described in this article management will now not have to commit valuable time to staying uptodate with the SIFI regulations and the neverending regulatory filings and this will allow for them to focus on the companys longterm strategy of growing the industrial businesses The other major reason indirectly relates to GE Digital in that the company is now free to allocate capital as the board and management deem necessary which means GE will be able to heavily invest in the industries that will matter over the next few decades This is an important factor because the IIoT transition is a major shift that will likely require a lot of capital but in my opinion these type of investments are necessary There are other benefits for not being labeled a SIFI but these two factors alone have the opportunity to create a great deal of value over the next few years The GEMSFT partnership is another step in the right direction when it comes to the companys longterm commitment to the digital industry In GE If You Build It They Will Come written in June I described Predix as a longterm catalyst that will create value over time and this prediction is slowly becoming a reality Again the real benefits will be in and beyond but by that point in time the stock price will be significantly higher than it is today The announced GEMSFT partnership and the SIFI dedesignation will not materially impact GEs bottom line in the current year but instead the benefits will play out over many years As such GE may not be the best place to put your money if you are looking for a quick profit However the stock is a great longterm buy at todays price if you are willing to wait for the investments being made today to start paying off Many believe GE is overvalued at share but I think that it all comes down to your investment time horizon If you are willing to hold on to the shares for threefive years and be patient while collecting an aboveaverage dividend then GE is a buy at todays price Yes the shares appear richly valued when compared to the earnings estimates but they look more and more attractive
