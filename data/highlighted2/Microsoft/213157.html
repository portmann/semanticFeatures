<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>beat estimates and marked fifteen year highs today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT today reported third quarter earnings after the market closed read the ER here and then Microsofts shares did what they havent done for more than years Break In the third quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grossed revenues of billion which is a percent decline yoy When we adjust for currency revenues were down percent yoy Operating income grew slightly to billion net income came in at billion Microsofts adjusted earnings per share came in at for a annual run rate or above estimates this percent beat is what propelled Microsofts share price up today On the first look a revenue decline even after adjusting for currency is not a good sign but there are a couple of things we have to consider here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported a small revenue decline and yet Microsofts operating earnings were up both adjusted this means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been able to grow its margins versus the prior year This is something we havent seen in a long time Microsofts operating margin has been declining for more than two years which was unfortunate since this means that the companys earnings were performing a lot worse than Microsofts revenues which were aided by the Nokia acquisition Microsofts margins were still pretty good but not at the levels seen a couple of years ago This quarter Microsofts operating margin was percent using nonGAAP numbers using GAAP numbers Microsofts operating margin was percent In any case this is a great result and one of the factors that allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to beat estimates so handily today What were the reasons for Microsofts higher margin First Microsofts focus on the cloud allows for high growth in a high margin area Microsofts Intelligent Cloud segment reported revenue growth of eight percent yoy to billion revenues were up percent adjusting for currency which makes Intelligent Cloud the best performing reporting segment Intelligent Cloud also is the segment with the highest operating margin Operating income of billion means that this segment has an operating margin of percent When the segment with the highest margin is the segment with the highest revenue growth rate this is beneficial for the companys overall margins as high value revenues make up a higher portion of Microsofts revenues now in comparison to the prior years quarter Second Microsofts cost saving efforts are paying off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cut jobs earlier this year which impacts the companys expense side In the third quarter Microsofts operating expenses declined about million yoy RD expenses declined million GA expenses declined million and sales expenses declined million Im not a fan of lowering RD expenses but as this hasnt been a huge reduction I wouldnt read too much into it The SGA savings of million on the other hand are very attractive as this means a nice boost to the companys operating and thus also net profit We will likely continue to see this positive effect over the next quarters until its included in the comps Apart from the margins another positive fact I want to look at are Microsofts stock buybacks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been accelerating the pace of its stock buybacks in the recent quarters and once again did so in the third quarter Over the last months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has spent billion on share repurchases which is a lot more than the company did over the last four years In this years third quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>spent billion on stock buybacks which brings the annual pace to billion which is another increase This higher spending is showing results as Microsofts share count has been dropping a lot faster over the last year as it did in the years before Since a lower share count means that the companys profits are distributed over a lower number of shares each shares portion of Microsofts earnings grows which makes each share more valuable over time At the current pace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is able to buy back about percent of its common stock each year billion versus a market capitalization of about B which means earnings per share will grow percent annually even if the companys net earnings were to remain flat which seems unlikely With Microsofts low leverage and huge cash pile of billion which is up billion over the last three months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is easily able to finance these stock buybacks along with its also attractive dividends and its operating needs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is up substantially today but I believe the companys shares have further upside Using the finbox valuation model I come to a fair value of upside of about percent with assumptions I rate conservative Longterm revenue growth of just percent small margin increases due to the reasons explained above higher revenues from high margin businesses such as the cloud and cost savings and an exit multiple which is below the peer group average Using the trailing PE ratio is not recommended here because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>faced a huge onetime charge during the last months but when we look at Microsofts forward earnings multiple of we can confirm that the company has some upside Paying times forward earnings for a company with a huge moat attractive dividend and AAAworthy balance sheet is not an expensive price I believe Microsofts shares marked a year high today after the company reported great third quarter results The key points I believe are the ability to grow the companys margins strong growth for important segments such as Microsofts cloud business and Microsofts attractive shareholder returns via dividends and stock buybacks I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still trades below fair value Its thus not too late to buy into this tech heavyweight with a wide moat
