Microsofts stock to a new level Windows will be the catalyst for the companys cloud growth Investors can expect Microsofts commercial other business to continue growing revenue at its current rate of over the next three years Given the success in the cloud business the stock is likely to increase from this inflection point over the next three years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is growing its cloud business at an opportune time There is high demand for enterprise cloud expansion and the new Windows operating system adds capabilities in virtualization and portability that few other competitors can achieve Additionally the shift to a more cloudbased business means higher revenue generation in comparison to individualized software licensing which has lower expected growth rates in the near term The company is positioned perfectly for this business shift and following the rollout of the Windows operating system the company has been marketing its cloud initiative superbly Microsofts Mike Schutz General Manager of Cloud Platform Marketing recently discussed the cloud business at the Deutsche Bank Technology Brokers Conference which provided more insight for investors on the value opportunity in the cloud business Cloud is revolutionizing Microsofts business and will be the key business segment that makes the company more competitive over the next three years For investors this transition to cloudbased growth initiatives will likely lead to a increase in the companys share value by The Windows operating system has been in the spotlight in recent weeks as the company released the new operating system and made free upgrades available for users What hasnt been as widely publicized is how Windows is revolutionizing Microsofts cloud offerings Schutzs comments at the Deutsche conference provided some timely key insights for investors on just how the cloud business transformation will take place Investors know Microsofts main cloud offerings extremely well most notably Azure Dynamics CRM and Office What many investors dont realize is the behindthescenes transformation that has been taking place in the cloud business as the Windows operating system has been revealed The companys key product offerings Azure Dynamics CRM and Office will continue to form the base for cloud growth The use of these product offerings will become even more streamlined as a result of Windows s new capabilities In addition to these core products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also has over services that can combine to make the companys user experience more efficient and customized With the new Windows operating system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now has the capabilities to more seamlessly put these services to work in the cloud for an even higher quality customer experience As a first milestone Windows s added capabilities will now allow Microsofts cloud offerings to surpass the capabilities of the Amazon Web Service and Googles cloud services catapulting its market share in the short term The companys unique ability to hyperscale its cloud services in the current environment in comparison to Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Google NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG is a key differentiator in the space According to Mike Schutz <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is one of only three hyperscale platforms and with data centers in regions it is purely outscaling Amazon and Google in its cloud capabilities Additionally its security layer capabilities are also a key differentiating factor as the company seeks to provide superior services above and beyond those of Amazon and Google In progression the more competitive capabilities of Windows can also be seen in Microsofts Windows Server which is a wellknown server that has been a steady revenue generator for the company Windows Server greatly contributes to the companys commercial and licensing business which brought in billion for the firm in It also greatly helps the marketing of the Windows operating system as Windows is used on approximately of the worlds commercial enterprise servers Migration to the use of Windows on these servers will be a substantial first step for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and its push right now around its Windows wave will incorporate more compatible capabilities of the Windows operating system into the Windows Server enterprise base which then will extend into the companys cloud server capabilities At this inflection point investors are going to begin to see customers transitioning from the Windows Server solution to a hybrid solution and then potentially to a pure cloud solution that utilizes Microsofts Azure cloud capabilities with Windows and thats where growth in the commercial other revenue is really going to take off It could already be seen in the numbers with the companys commercial other business growing in led by sales from Azure Dynamics CRM and Office offerings Now with the incorporation of Windows operating system capabilities investors are going to see the commercial other business continue to grow at a steady annual rate of over the next three years These projections come from Satya Nadella himself in comments following the fourthquarter earnings release Im proud of these steps and Im proud of the results we delivered in tandem In cloud alone our annualized commercial cloud runrate surpassed billion this quarter and the revenue grew year over year We are on a strong trajectory towards our goal of billion in fiscal year Some of the key features that Windows can provide for include greater virtualization capabilities and greater portability of applications For customers this means more innovation in the workplace around virtualization It also means customers can more easily add Microsoftcompatible applications to their platforms through the use of Windows on either the server cloud or a hybrid of both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has ideally timed the introduction of its Windows operating system with the transformation of its cloud business and in my opinion now is an opportune time for investors to buy the shares in the leading technology company Cloud revenue is going to grow substantially while licensing revenue growth tapers off This was seen in and is going to continue to be the case through In devices and consumer licensing revenue was down versus revenue growth of in commercial other With the new Windows innovation commercial other is going to continue growing even more substantially while devices and consumer licensing also gains marginally purely from new software licensing sales If the new technological innovations and sales projections are not compelling enough investors can also see Microsofts upside potential in the firms fundamental operating capabilities and the stocks PE trading multiple Over the past five years the company has generated return on shareholder equity of Additionally its fiveyear average gross margin leads the industry at further evidencing its capability to consistently generate profit For analysts are projecting a revenue of billion and EPS of Over the threeyear period analysts are projecting average annual revenue and EPS growth of and respectively Meanwhile the firm trades below the broader markets forward PE multiple at versus the SP s forward PE multiple of The strong outlook and lower PE multiple further exemplify Microsofts upside potential in the current market environment Lastly the firm is at no loss for free cash flow which increases its latitude for development around its alreadystrong cloud initiative For the trailing twelve months it had free cash flow of billion or per share Also impressive is its free cash flow to revenue comparison of over the past five years Overall there are a number of exciting things going on with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and its cloud business initiative is superbly timed In my opinion growth in the cloud business is going to lift the stock to the mid range over the next three years as shown in the discounted cash flow illustration below and the added benefit from its dividend yield gives it an upside potential of nearly We only use your contact details to reply
