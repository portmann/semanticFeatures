class='textDiv'>Facebook At Work Could Be A Stepping Stone Toward A Real Enterprise Software Suite Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha The free Facebook At Work enterprise app helps companies build a private social network for their employees to contact and collaborate with each other It doesnt offer any real spreadsheet or document creation features like Office or Google Apps For Work do right now I believe Facebook NASDAQ FB is eager to grow its empire outside its advertising comfort zone Going forward I see Facebook eventually offering premium enterprise productivity apps like what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are doing right now Its true that its core advertising business has helped FB breach the old price target I argued for last year However I expect the growing adblocking trend and stiff competition from Google will eventually slow down Facebooks advertising momentum Its therefore welcome news that Facebook recently announced that its Facebook At Work app for the enterprise just landed a client in Royal Bank of Scotland Facebook At Work is still a free app and also advertisingfree that helps companies build a private social network for their employees Royal Bank of Scotland is using this free app to build a walledin custom social network for its employees I expect Facebook to eventually monetize this product in the future because Zuckerbergs original vision for Facebook was always to make profit out of the users of its softwareplatform Since enterprise clients will likely stay away from using a free adladen software I expect Zuckerberg to ultimately offer Facebook At Work as a subscriptiononly enterprise app that could include productivity features like what Office and Google Apps For Work do right now As of now employees will be able to create a distinct account for their companys Facebook Work network to collaborate and communicate with other employees Facebook at Work also will allow text chats audio and video calls between coworkers instead of them relying on paid enterprise apps like Skype For Business However common sense tells me that Royal Bank of Scotland is unlikely to pay any subscription fees for Facebook At Work unless it offers productivity features That bank is likely paying for a peruser annual license for Office so that its employees can do spreadsheets create documents and make presentation slideshows Its my fearless forecast that Facebook At Work is just an experiment toward creating an alternative Facebookbranded Office cloudbased platform for corporations that are currently dependent on Office and Google Apps For Work Its not that hard or expensive to create a cloudbased spreadsheet or document creation app that allows workers on Facebook At Works social network createcollaborate over officerelated documentsfiles I opine that programmer Zuckerberg himself could spend a week creating a mobileweb word processor if he wants to do so right now Facebook has a compelling need to grow outside of its advertisingcentric business model Its true that Facebook gets most of its ad revenue from mobile apps However there will come a time when Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Google will not be able to detect and ban apps masquerading as browseronly adblockers Been Choice was a bestselling iOS app that went beyond its Safarionly adblocking claims Apple banned Been Choice because it also blocks ads on other mobile apps like Facebook and Apples own News app There will come a time that greedy thirdparty mobile app developers will start to sell software that will reduce the revenue stream from Facebooks appinstall advertising platform I therefore posit that the rapidly growing enterprise software as a service SaaS market is a fertile expansion ground for Facebook Document creation apps like Office and Google Apps are one of the growth drivers for the upcoming billionyear SaaS subscription industry Integrating a word processor and spreadsheet creator within Facebook At Work is a believable future scenario Facebooks almost billion active users obviously include government and private employees They are already familiar with Facebooks web and mobile networks interface like they are familiar with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Offices desktop and web version UI It will not be difficult for employees to shift from Office to a Facebookbranded desktop or cloudbased productivity software The economic benefits of providing a subscriptiononly enterprise productivity app is easy to comprehend Google Apps For Work charges per user monthly fee <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>charges per user as a monthly fee for its cheaper Office business plan Im confident that Facebook could eventually really compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google by coming up with a flat per user monthly licensing fee for its own future enterprise productivity suite x million employees using Facebook productivity apps million per month Multiply by and we get billionyear of potential nonadvertising related revenue stream The free Facebook At
