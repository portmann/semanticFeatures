Many fans of IBM NYSE IBM are probably wondering how it is possible for AmazonCom NASDAQ AMZN to make such inroads into government cloud contracting with the Federal Aviation Administration now joining the CIA in using Amazon Web Services and forsaking IBM for big data work The answer is Computer Sciences Corp NYSE CSC Having someone who knows government contracting like Amazon willing to represent it to government agencies is potentially a very big deal for Amazon if not for CSC Computer Sciences has long been one of the biggest players in US government computer contracting Government contracting has a completely different setup than private contracting There are huge costs upfront not just in schmoozing bureaucrats but in demonstrating capabilities All these investments must be made up on the backend which is the real reason costs are so high Its not the graft its the system CSC understands this system lives inside it and really has difficulty working outside it But it is being pressured on costs just like everyone else and so it has brought in a lowcost cloud partner specifically Amazon in order to stay in the game These relationships change government contracting in profound ways Deals made through IBM and other traditional vendors usually involved sales of equipment with the main contractor taking a cut off the top IBM sold the hardware and software in other words and CSC installed and managed the system as general contractor Cloud deals have compelling economics and CSC has now brought Amazons nose under the domestic contracting tent much as the CIA brought it under the defense contracting tent The latest deal is a good example Unlike the CIA deal this one involves application services not just big data manipulation Thus a third partner was added

</span>offers the software applications layer CSC does the system integration job and works to get the business This does not make CSC itself a buy CSC is not a growth stock Federal government contracting has not been a growth business during the current Administration not the way it was in the previous one CSC sales have been marching slowly downward there are quarters where its completely unprofitable But it pays a steady dividend currently cents and the market cap is just twothirds of annual revenue which is ridiculously cheap for a company involved in technology The deal keeps <span

#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a hold on this news Amazon a buy and CSC for now is an ignore Should the political winds change and contracting grow rapidly again CSC is in a great position to take advantage due to the lowcost structure Amazon has provided it If Jeb Bush becomes President in other words buy CSC As it is taxpayers are the primary beneficiaries of this deal Their government will be operating at lower cost Government had been an IBMdominated field for decades Now it faces lowcost cloud competition shepherded by a company that knows how to get contracts This is just one more reason why despite IBM now selling at times earnings and less than times its annual sales I would not touch it if for no other reason than it was left out of the FAA contract As the cloud rises IBM falls companies like CSC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>fight to hang on while pure cloud plays like Amazon continue to benefit thanks to their low cost structure
