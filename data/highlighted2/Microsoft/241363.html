class='textDiv'>Apple iPad Pro Is A Bust Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti My Janet Yellen Impersonation clicks The iPad Pro isnt a true laptop replacement which highlights a weakness in Apples lineup AAPL should merge iOS and OS X to create a proper competitor to in Windows PCs Does this blunder mean Tim Cook is losing touch with the consumer leading Apple to have trouble with the Apple TV package set to be released in In an article last year I advised Apple NASDAQ AAPL to create a touchscreen laptop Touchscreen laptops are popular with Windows users Some can detach from the keyboard to be used as a tablet Personally I have witnessed the usability enhancements with my Asus OTCASUUY touchscreen laptop New laptop iterations have been trending in this direction with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro and Surface Book leading the charge As much as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been lampooned for its smartphone strategy it has gotten this market correct after it originally failed with the Surface RT Consumers want productivity if they are going to spend close to on a PCtablet Apple has decided to ignore my method of thinking with the release of its iPad Pro which is just a bigger iPad Air Most reviewers have been confused about what the point of the device is and who the target demographic is There are a few explanations for why this has happened The first is there is a shortage of pencils and keyboards Having to wait weeks for accessories meant to make the iPad Pro different from the iPad Air is problematic The company should have delayed the release of the product until the accessories were in full supply Most consumers will decide whether to buy the iPad Pro by watching YouTube videos and reading articles about the product Having tech reviewers mention an easily avoidable negative about the device could depress a potential customers excitement about purchasing one Another reason for the confusion was Tim Cooks statement that the iPad Pro could replace your PC This is not true for a lot of users The device runs iOS so it cant run some desktoplevel programs such as Adobe Photoshop It doesnt even support a mouse as the keyboard doesnt have a trackpad The reviews echo this sentiment as Mobile Tech Review questioned the point of comparing it to the Surface Pro because it doesnt run desktoplevel software Because of the lack of productivity capabilities the device leaves users wondering who it is trying to sell to besides artists who will take advantage of the pencil At this point MacBooks or the Surface provides much more value at a similar price point Obviously it isnt great that Apple wont be able to stem the tide of declining iPad sales with the iPad Pro but this blunder sets a bad precedent for Apple which thrives off a stellar brand image When Tim Cook says I think if youre looking at a PC why would you buy a PC anymore No really why would you buy one it really calls into question his opinion on future product decisions because using the iPad Pro as a PC replacement isnt viable unless you just browse the Web and do word processing on your device in this case an iPad Air would work as your main PC as well This leads me to imagine Apple releasing a TV service next year where Tim Cook says he doesnt see why a user would ever subscribe to Netflix NASDAQ NFLX again even though the service lacks key programming Apple investors own the stock for the firms future innovations which havent been released yet If it cant create a proper touchscreen laptop then how will it create a great bundle of TV programs at a reasonable price when it has no experience doing so Tim Cook recently described the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface Book by saying Its a product that tries too hard to do too much Its trying to be a tablet and a notebook and it really succeeds at being neither Its sort of diluted This differs from what the reviewers have stated as CNET gives it a out of and TechRadar Pro gives it a out of saying While the Surface Book brings many technological innovations to the laptop space its greatest strength is that its just an allaround terrific device This means Tim Cook will not be changing his decision making on the positioning of the iPad Pro anytime soon The problem is Apple needs to merge its iOS software with OS X to solve this and properly compete with the Surface This would be a huge undertaking which explains why Tim Cook hasnt decided to do it Expecting consumers to buy an iPad and a MacBook is not reasonable if in Windows laptops exist Tim Cook can bash the Surface Book all he wants but currently the iPad Pro is an overpowered tablet that doesnt provide any additional features for the added price and doesnt take advantage of the additional screen real estate Apple knows that creative destruction is the best way to increase sales as it was able to destroy BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY with its touchscreen iPhones It should recognize this problem and amend its product line The only other option is to create an inbetween software option like the Surface RT As you know this strategy didnt work out for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which leads me to be against this option Consumers need to intuitively understand what they are purchasing I remember being in an app development class run by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I asked the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>employee running the class what the RT software was and she couldnt explain it Likewise Apple probably wouldnt be able to explain OS X RT The other option would be to continue down its current path and make no changes In this case AAPL would never have touchscreen laptops This strategy sounds like how BlackBerry went against touchscreen phones Apple really needs to work on the iPad Pro to improve its software to compete with the desktoplevel quality of the Surface Book and Surface Pro While I understand new products like the Apple Watch not having a plethora of thirdparty applications at the launch the iPad Pro isnt in a new category of devices It is not a tablet It is a laptop wannabe Apple has more experience making laptops than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does but it still hasnt created a product that competes well with either the Surface Pro or the Surface Book Apples failed iPad Pro launch signifies a need to merge iOS and Mac OS X to create a product that runs the necessary applications to be a laptop replacement Tim Cooks tone sounds like he is going to need to see a huge decline in sales to change his perspective At this point Windows PCs will have already taken a lead ahead of the MacBook and the iPad Pro This signifies a loss of touch when it comes to product launches which might be a
