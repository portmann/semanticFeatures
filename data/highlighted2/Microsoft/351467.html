</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha I was blown away by Power BI at the recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Data Insights Summit In my opinion Power BI is the future of the allimportant productivity suite and what a bright future it is Power BI with updates announced is the single most comprehensive BI solution in the marketplace I believe as well as one quoted industry expert that Power BI might be on the verge of smart suggestions Integration with Cortana expanded governance natural language deployment and tenantlevel usage reporting should mean more pain for Power BI competitors After recently attending the Microsofthosted NASDAQ MSFT Data Insights Summit in Bellevue Washington a quasiconference which Im told <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will host annually into perpetuity focused on announcing highlighting and displaying updates to Microsofts business intelligence BI engine Power BI Im now convinced that Power BI is the single best BI engineplatform available stands little chance of being unseated as such in the near term if ever and stands a good chance at being as important to the general productivity suite at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as Excel No need to bury the lead here Im confident in all three core bullet points to this note Yes I understand these are all strong statements Yes I understand these all have the potential if eventually proved out as accurate to reshape the BIlandscape as well as Microsofts share price on all durations In that Ill try to justify all of the above within the body of this note If youre a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investor especially a buy and hold forever investor youre going to want to stay in the loop here But first to provide context I should note that Ive followed the evolution and development of Power BI since its inception Ive also followed since the early days of the space many other BI platforms Ive written about many for Seeking Alpha including those engines from Tableau NYSE DATA Qlik NASDAQ QLIK Datawatch NASDAQ DWCH Dell privately held IBM NYSE IBM Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Salesforcecom NYSE CRM So if thats any justification I think I have a wide enough sampling of the space to make such claims Also Ive been both positive and negative on all the above engines including Power BI at times during coverage I think that I can accurately state that Ive not been a prisoner of the moment or a fanboy outright of any platform even of Power BI which Im now strongly fighting the urge to go full fanboy for postData Insights Summit The general point is its only recently that Ive decided that Power BI is now and will continue to prove out to be the eventual winner in the highly competitive BI space Still for those that have followed my running BInarrative at Seeking Alpha I thought that postData Insights Summit the narrative deserved an update To take a step back before plunging into the core update it should be noted that Im not alone in what Ive professed so far the tremors of what Ive outlined were already being felt in the market prior to the Data Insights Summit Taking a look at the recent technical share price performance of Tableau Qlik and to a much lesser correlated extent Datawatch one can see that serious concerns about several spatial variables most importantly competitive landscape have weighed on all three public companies These concerns have been growing with each quarter since the initial softlaunch of Power BI evidence easy enough to extrapolate using dates of launch of Power BI and share price performance But it isnt just concerns that have pressed on valuations for the trio its been realization of concerns All three public companies have experienced meaningful deceleration of overall growth meaningful deceleration of forwardlooking key metric growth these vary by company but for example Tableaus License Revenue fell for the third sequential quarter at last quarters reporting and meaningful deceleration of upsell ability again indications of this vary by company but this is an allimportant measure of overall health While some in the analyst community have been quick to excuse the concerning financials and key metrics at the trio some havent been Several analysts have directly noted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Power BI as headwinds which are in the very least adding to what ails the valuations at these companies I happen to think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Power BI are much more responsible than simply being headwinds to healthy growth of the trio Again I think Power BI has evidenced itself and no more visibly has it ever done this than at the Data Insights Summit as the clear frontrunner BI engine in the space Admittedly the weakest and most subjective contributor to my argument in favor of Power BIs spacewide platform dominance is that the platforms aesthetics are a step ahead and a step above its competitors Frankly after powerusing Power BI although I do in fact use point solutions in platforms provided by both Dell and Datawatch more on this later all other platforms feel generic Again subjective but I think the feel test matters in gaining widespread adoption from nondata science enthusiasts or what IBM calls citizen analysts and in ultimately gaining the holy grail of traction from a user base Regarding IBM this is the primary reason improving the feel of its own Watson Analytics BI platform for it spending money to deploy its own recently updated Expert Storybooks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>engineers at least the ones I had the pleasure of speaking with at the Summit including Principal Group PM Jono Luk agreed entirely with me In fact aesthetics and really the general user interface is a huge focus for the entire development team at Power BI This is where we move beyond the subjective of aesthetics and into the business of aesthetics After having been blown away in the opening keynote by the new for once Microsoftcreated datavisuals being released now or in the immediate term it had been a while since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had released an internally generated datavisual worth using in high volume what struck me most was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has entered into the entertaining and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has learned from its ecosystem of contributors Both to me are cultural shifts with CEO Satya Nadellas signature across them First Im not even going to attempt to do Microsofts new animated datavisuals justice Ill tell you though that youre going to want to see these new datavisuals in action because if youre in the business of BI investing in BI platform companies or in any way interested in the space these are game changers The following link will example Power BIs new Sand Dance animated visualization Sand Dance for me is the single most important user interfaceuser experience development in the young history of BI It also leaves bread crumbs to what I believe will be an integrated BI experience with HoloLens etc down the road subject matter for another update That matters too especially for helping drive hardwarebased sales of Surface Hub in the immediate term yet another immediate and midterm valuation driver for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>But the big takeaway here is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has found a way to allow presentations to literally show how data are correlated Not visually explain not visually make simpler to analyze but to show Again I wont try to do Sand Dance or several others justice but youre going to want to know what Sand Dance is I reiterate my call to click the link above Outside of making presentations infinitely more effective Sand Dance and other animated visualizations has the potential to attract and retain entirely new classes of users One example I can give is the television media user I spoke with members of the KING team in Seattle who told me that Sand Dance coupled with an already purchased Surface Hub again Microsofts Smart Display platform has the potential to provide it a version of CNNs Magic Wall When it comes to marketing familiarization and general adoption bringing Power BI to the television media vertical is going to be huge Dont underestimate how powerful the network effect can be in growing deployment of the platform among other ancillary hardware and software product sales Also dont underestimate how mainstream usage and highly visible examples of mainstream usage such as that potentially at KING can be effective in relaxing the public as to the ease of use concerns for the platform Again the business of aesthetics can be and is very real One product engineer who asked not to be named told me the biggest problem with direct BI integration to Excel wasis ease of use connotation issues translated to mean that most users or potential users are simply too intimidated to try to learn Excel I would agree with the engineer Whats equally encouraging is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made clear that it has no intention of stopping or even slowing Power BIs allowance of custom datavisualization creation and contribution from users Power BIs user ecosystem has been huge in providing constantly evolving constantly refreshed and more and more useful datavisuals that continuously expand the spectrum of use of the platform As stated above if I have one complaint about the platform that isnt capacitybased Ill explain my one big complaint next its that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been far and few between with its creation of useful effective datavisuals company created given that the development team has been so focused on underlying platform capacity improvement this isnt all that big a concern of mine in the overall scheme of things The user ecosystem has been doing most of the heavy lifting in this regard so to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>realizing this acknowledging this and finally stepping up with a datavisual set that is a tectonic shift for the space means more than I can articulate Microsofts general cultural shift to one of being more inclusive of ecosystem and user base is apparent and its wellappreciated by this user Those users familiar with Excel and what a pain it can be at times and just how intimidating it can be to new users know how big user inclusion is to overall proliferation of platform eventual collaboration and to ultimate use case expansion If folks arent using the platform or are too afraid to try what use is the platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has worked tirelessly and with a superb attention to detail to control the aesthetics of Power BI because it understands the power of a first impression What its done so far in controlling the business of aesthetics has been nothing short of incredible Believe that matters to the competitive landscape and believe that matters to market cap on all durations SEE before and after Power BI launch charts above So weve established that I believe Power BI is more inviting easier to use and that is has a more finishedpolished feel than the competitive set Also that is its become infinitely more useful from a datavisual standpoint with the release of Sand Dance and other animated datavisuals But what about spectrum of usage Capturing the nonpower user is huge for adoption and creating a learning cost to the platform the phenomenon that occurs when a platform becomes a base platform for the general public for example Windows and creates a cost to switching to a new platform because the user is forced to learn something new which slows productivity this is immeasurably important for retention but how high can Power BI reach How powerful is Power BI from an enterprise standpoint Up to this point preData Insights Summit the answer was not very At least not very from a differentiation standpoint To be fair Id say preData Insights Summit Tableau had the product of use for the power user from a capacity standpoint In trying to keep Power BI user friendly and in trying to cast a wide net Power BI had in effect handcuffed itself from an optionality standpoint Sure it had made a one size fits all platform for the nonpower user But in this it hadnt really opened up the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>vault of potential That changed with the opening keynote at the Summit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>among other things is introducing to Power BI bettermore expanded governance including rolelevel access governance tenantlevel usage reporting to make sure the platform is actually being used deepened integration with Excel which will make the broader productivity suite and its licensing that much stickier at enterprises and integration with Cortana which will exponentially expand the usage of natural language deployment of Power BI this is huge All of these are meaningful improvements to the platform and will be undeniably attractive to enterprise customers and prospects This matters to valuation again I would point to the share price charts in the introduction of this note This will also matter to the ability for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>competitors to well compete I can tell you in my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now has the single most comprehensive BI platform from a sheer functionality standpoint in the entire space Even if youre a fan of other platforms not a single other platform can do what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can do at this point when factoring in total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ecosystem integration this is preSurface Hub and preHoloLens That too matters to valuation But none of this is what I was long waiting for What I was waiting for was the introduction of predictive analytics and helpful suggestions from Power BI We got that too at the opening keynote <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for the first time exampled predictive analytics within Power BI Now to be clear things are starting out slow But that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now has datavisuals that will include things like trend line modeling and other predictive analytics is huge including for realtime data deployment usage This if continued to be built out should allow powerusers Im assuming there are others like me that do this to stop using ancillary products as point solution providers Currently I use a BI solution from Datawatch to assist with pattern recognition and predictive analytics although it too is inadequate from a completeness standpoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now introducing its entire product umbrella to Power BI inclusive of Cortana should be able to play catch up rather quickly thats the hope One neuromorphic chip maker based in Australia Brainchip OTCAZKLF which I follow closely believes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could be on the brink of taking Power BI into smart suggestion territory If so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could take an early hard to unseat defensible leadership position in huge total addressable markets like Financial Services If I can see this opening or this hole in the market you can bet the much smarter folks at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can see this opening For me this is the single most important development to watch in regards to Power BI how far the platform can be taken from a predictive analytics standpoint Considering the integration of platforms the neural network that would need to be built out and the level of sophistication of doing such a thing I wanted to ask a recognized expert in the field via Peter Van Der Made CTO and interim CEO of Australianbased Neuromorphic chip maker BrainChip Holdings If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt already investing heavily into solutions to take Power BI into smart suggestion territory that likely is only because it is looking to buy instead of develop options are available from many base solutions For instance our SNAP is a marketready solution one that can literally be plug and play for Power BI that can help provide an answer for one of the largest problems in financial dataanalytics today the ability to recognize patterns without having to be preprogrammed to recognize patterns Put another way while the majority of todays analytical engines are adequate for recognizing patterns once deeptrained to do so we dont believe there is true deep learning in todays technology but this is a subject for another day and another conversation the problem is they quite literally have to be programmed for what to look for this limits the spectrum of visibility for pattern recognition or the total scope of usage for todays typical analytical engine SNAP which again is one option <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has limitless optionality with its funding capacity allows for a truly open architecture pattern recognition especially when plugged into an engine such as Power BI especially if correctly integrated with Cortana in that our chip doesnt need to be programmed for frankly anything it simply learns to recognize patterns on its own while it processes data and learns what is within normal parameters for the data itself and what is not With other systems like deep learning people have to know what to look for With the SNAP technology the chip learns to recognize any patterns that are present in the data set even if they are not obvious to a human observer Imagine this value when presented via Power BI to a global financial firm or a global PR firm even a global network of Twitter mentions could be monitored to monitor sentiment and presented via Power BI dashboards SNAP learns to recognize these patterns in seconds which could be helpful if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is serious about taking Cortana into coupledplatform areas with Power BI Deep Learning solutions need to be trained with the patterns that the user wants to recognize they have to be known Training a deep learning system is a lengthy operation that can take days or weeks depending on how complex the patterns are BrainChip SNAP learns in real time to extract patterns and label them in the data set something that Cortana is rumored to be working on in development for natural language query Todays deep learning or cognitive analytical engines are the equivalent of stargazing through a piece of rolled paper you can see into space but with limited scope and with limited capacity SNAP we believe has already evidenced and can evidence on demand is a way to view the stars using a high powered telescope andor using a mapping engine that takes in the entirety of space Its simply a better way to drive business outcomes in that it truly is a compliment to a fine instrument such as Power BI an instrument that can present data in easy to understand ways for easy to execute actionable understandings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been active as of late in acquiring SNAPlite technology so were quite aware that it has much broader much higher ceiling intentions for Power BI We wish them luck If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is first in this niches version of the Space Race Power BI will move from a freemium and lowcost version <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>currently only has two pricing tiers and one is free to one that could charge incredible amounts of licensing fees Yes financial service firms and Im really dialing in on this vertical because this is an area Im highly familiar with have staff that can write predictive and pattern recognizing algorithms but as pointed out in the excerpt above these dont learn and cant make smart suggestions Essentially theyre monkey see monkey do What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now publicly appears to be leaning into is the evolved version of this and that could have ramifications that could have it preying on competitors on a much much wider list than just BI If the billions in market cap siphoned off its BI competitors is any indication IBM Oracle NYSE ORCL Amazon etc had better be closely
