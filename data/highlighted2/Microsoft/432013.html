style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO Satya Nadella in his efforts to make the venerable software company a major force in nextgeneration computing By connecting widely used software like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Word and PowerPoint with LinkedIns network of million professionals the combination could enable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to add a suite of sales marketing and recruiting services to its core business products and potentially challenge cloud software rivals such as Salesforcecom Inc CRMN LinkedIn and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really share a mission of helping people work more efficiently said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO Nadella in a conference call with analysts There is no better way to realize that mission than to connect the worlds professionals The pershare price tag represented a premium of almost percent over LinkedIns stock market value as of Friday but was still well below the social media companys alltime high of Analysts said the price was rich and Microsofts stock closed down percent at Still there was cautious optimism that this could be one of the relatively few tech megamergers that works out well Its a massive growth play for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said Forrester analyst Ted Schadler The deal may also help spur further mergers and acquisitions in the tech sector where a broad correction is bringing down the prices of public and private companies even as a handful of major players sit on large cash piles For LinkedIn founded in and launched the following year by Reid Hoffman one of Silicon Valleys mostvisible investors and entrepreneurs the sale marks the end of a classic startup run funding from toptier venture capitalists a long period of building the company and developing a revenue base then a big initial public offering followed by a rollercoaster stock price and finally an acquisition The company makes most of its billion in annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people on whats often known as the social network for business The companys growth has slowed recently and investors have become far more cautious on the high valuations of many tech companies both of which likely figured into LinkedIns decision to sell analysts said For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the LinkedIn deal is a chance to reverse a terrible track record with acquisitions including paying billion for phone maker Nokia in and billion for ad business aQuantive in In it wrote down its aQuantive acquisition by billion and its cumulative writedowns for Nokia total billion It also paid billion for business network Yammer in and billion for videocalling tool Skype in The LinkedIn acquisition could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>play to its strengths in analytics machine learning and artificial intelligence Nadella said on the investor call LinkedIn and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>both have enormous amount of data about their customers that can potentially be mined to offer automated suggestions and other features that make business processes quicker and simpler <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>noted that the deal brings in a big new customer base after adding in LinkedIn the total potential market size of Microsofts productivity and businessprocess segment sits at billion up from billion without LinkedIn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the deal would be financed mainly with debt a way for the cashrich company to reduce its tax bill The company has billion in cash and other liquid assets Moodys said it was reviewing Microsofts rare AAA debt rating for a possible downgrade LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner will remain with the company which will be operated as a separate unit and retain its name Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>since taking over the lumbering giant two years ago and has helped build more credibility around the companys efforts in areas such as cloudbased services When he took the top job in February the companys share price was early Monday afternoon it was trading around With LinkedIn Nadella is solidifying Microsofts focus on the business market where it has retained a much stronger position than it has in the smartphonecentric consumer technology business In touting the synergies of the deal Nadella gave an example of a customer walking into a meeting scheduled on a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Outlook calendar integrated with LinkedIn That person might receive notification that one of the people in the meeting went to college with a colleague enabling another level of connection The future of productivity is around people identity and data and the relationships between the them said Matt McIlwain a portfolio manager at Madrona Ventures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is buying LinkedIn for the opportunity to leverage these capabilities and combine them with Microsofts strong but complementary assets in those three areas The strategy in many ways is similar to that of Salesforcecom whose CEO Marc Benioff just last month told investors he believed artificial

that market Despite Microsofts weak track record in MA the one prior major deal on Nadellas watch the billion purchase of video game maker Minecraft in is generally considered a success complementing Microsofts work on augmentedreality projects such as the HoloLens headset Weiner of LinkedIn said on a call with Reuters that he met Nadella two years ago at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO Summit a meeting of top executives at the software companys campus near Seattle and started serious talks about an acquisition in February That was shortly after LinkedIns stock fell by percent following a weak earnings report Weiner added LinkedIn would remain its own entity in the way that YouTube is relatively independent from parent Alphabet Inc GOOGLO or Instagram from parent Facebook Inc FBO That could ease concerns that users might have about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>being in control of their professional information though the kind of integration Nadella cited suggests that LinkedIn might not be its own entity forever Mondays deal raised investors hopes that another social media company Twitter Inc TWTRN could be
