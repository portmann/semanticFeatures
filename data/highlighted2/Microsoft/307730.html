positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Intel is a basically CPU chip company of profit with a few minor addons Desktop and mobile are under duress and data centers market share cannot continue billion in operating cash flow over the last five years has done little for shareholders as earnings have actually fallen over that time period In Intels NASDAQ INTC most recent earnings call on January th Intels Bobbsey Twins CEO Brian Drone Krzanich and CFO Stacy Haiku Smith continued their longrunning semantic attack on corporate performance or lack thereof After five years of promises and almost billion in free cash flow billion of operating cash flow Intels earnings have dropped from in to in As we look forward to the next five years what are thechances that the disappointments of the last five years will be revisited on shareholders over the next five years In the last year I have written articles on Intel mostly critical of managements approach to providing information that investors can use to make investment decisions pro or con In the first of those articles Cautionary Points For Intel Investors I presented my overview and after a recent review of that article I think those points still stand I ended that article with this quote My question remains does Intel have the management team in place to retake the high ground I remain unconvinced and will wait until I can see some signs of success along the route As of the date of the article February the closing price was as opposed to the Friday Jan closing price of So obviously caution was in order because you could have waited a year to buy at a lower price and still have the benefit of any future increases in price In this article I will present an argument that the current concentration of sales and profits in the dog CCG and DCG cannot soon be replaced by any of the tails whether IoT nonvolatile memory or softwaresecurity The big dog rides alone and endless attacks by competition over the next five years will lessen the monopolistic margins it currently enjoys Margins from the other tail product lines will never come close to matching what Intel currently enjoys If we look at the dog Client Computing Group and Data Center Group and compare that dog to the tails representing everything other than CCG and DCG we can see there is no tail that can possibly fill in for the big dog If CCG andor DCG do not deliver huge and continuing profit there is no backup behind them to pick up the slack So having Intel management continue to conflate DCG and IoT for example is disingenuous at best IoT and the others are like fleas on the dog On the first chart we can see that as a percentage of revenue the tails have ranged from to of total revenue since There is no surging source of revenue in any of the tails future IoT often mentioned by Intel and others as a future bright spot grew at a miniscule last year and in compared to a market growing at a CAGR of over to As I have repeatedly said Intel is not set up to make huge bucks in IoT because of their lack of software services and data analytics areas that will generate the most IoT profits IoT will not save Intel if CCG and DCG run into trouble over the next five years Here is one of my articles on Intel and IoT As for the Software and Services Group SSG no one would promote them as any sort of hope for a prosperous Intel future When Intel bought McAfee and Wind River Systems their combined sales were about billion In sales for the SSG group was billion This is a tiny stub of a tail for sure and an unsuccessful one at that That leaves nonvolatile memory as the future replacement of any degradation in the legacy systems sales and profits As of now they are buried in a group called all other and which includes various charges for intercompany transactions and chargeoffs Certainly this will be a standalone group eventually containing both D NAND and D Xpoint The fact that they do not have their own group yet tells me that management has low expectations for these new products in and maybe Note Source of following charts author and Intel Q earnings releases As a percentage of sales the tails have actually decreased over the last five years The following chart shows that the big dog has big margins and the little tails have little margins And before you get too excited by NVM potentially saving the day remember that NAND manufacturer Sandisks NASDAQ SNDK operating Margin in before their buyout by Western Digital NASDAQ WDC was So it will likely take a lot of NVM sales to make up for any slowdown in CCG or DCG sales even if D Xpoint has higher than average NVM margins If we look at sales and profits over the latest fiveyear period we see nothing to inspire us about Intels future performance Note that net income peaked in and revenue has moved up and down over the last five years So if you did not know these numbers came from Intel would you expect a PE ratio greater than todays Current CEO Brain Krzanich has been in charge since May of It looks to me that he has a pass on but I think must be a blockbuster for him to keep his job That may not be easy with desktops continuing to be a challenging market and servers facing new competitors in like Qualcomm and their Chinese partner So it is up to new products like D NAND and D Xpoint to provide the buster in blockbuster next year The problem is even if Krzanich is replaced will the board go outside for a new fresh viewpoint or will they stick to their traditional approach of promoting inbred Intel managers to the top job Intel desperately needs to stop concentrating on process we are three nodes ahead of everybody and concentrate on profits what can we sell today that our customers will buy I dont see that happening unless they go outside of Santa Clara to find a new CEO Their forecast for sales is so low beating it should be easy Management predicts a low to mid single digit sales increase which means organic growth of only because Altera adds billion all by itself So consistent sales beats could generate some stock price upside Desktop sales will certainly improve over last years minus Even a small increase should help beat expectations and support the stock price The dividend boost adds some comfort for longterm holders The latest increase in the dividend to puts the rate well above and with Intels continuing strong cash flow perhaps another few cents can be added at the end of Stock buybacks continue though at a slower rate To Intels credit they have bought back about almost of their shares in the last five years going from about billion shares to about billion That has propped up the earnings per share even though it is down from Intels huge success over the last few decades is mostly the result of an historical anomaly the IBM PC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows and the x instruction set But over the last five years their inability to develop new profitable products in spite of huge cash flows endangers their future success And the intense competition with legacy products and new products will only increase between now and This is why I think Intels top management needs to step up their game and soon The clock is ticking I think waiting another six months or even longer before buying would be prudent Intel remains at best a hold until they actually produce some positive results Since Intels CFO Stacy Smith is famous for his Haiku poetry see two of them in last years yearend presentation I think its only appropriate that I end this article with another Haiku </div></body></html>
