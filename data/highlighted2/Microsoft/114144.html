will release its much anticipated Power BI summer update in days and I couldnt be more excited It also looks like the update wont disappoint Lets break it all down First really understand how important Power BI is to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has one goal right now and thats to unify its platforms into one synergistic closedloop ecosystem The reasons why the company wants to do this are obvious That said I think its SMBenterprise strategies which under one umbrella could be called its business or nonconsumer strategies are even more important to its longterm viability than the companys mobile and gaming strategies CEO Satya Nadella has made this an overt priority in recent weeks through multiple mediums It doesnt take much deep analysis to understand why Microsofts golden goose is its enterprise productivity suite This is a high margin recurring and defensible revenue stream for the company that can provide a base level of financials for everything else to build from What the nonconsumer segments do is allow the productivity suite a larger funnel and a new whitespace funnel Prior to Power BI and the former Designer now named Desktop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>largely wasnt in the data or BI game Now it is And it isnt just in the game its an AllAmerican So knowing this Power BI and Desktop arent just important as standalone apps theyre important to providing a funnel to the productivity suite Further as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has evidenced with its commitment to the new Surface Hub Power BI and Desktop might become and I anticipate they will base platforms that open up an entire suite of ancillary revenue and retention drivers This is a big deal guys Now that were all up to speed lets talk about the summer update So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been testing and implementing new changes to both Power BI and Desktop the last several months at a feverish pace Clearly and definitively setting a new standard for itself distancing itself from the longdated comprehensive iteration updates that have plagued some of the productivity suite in the past This too signaled a shift to both SMBenterprise AND to the consumer that maybe just maybe a newMicrosoft is here I believe one is These updates culminated in a final surveying of users that literally asked us what we wanted from both platforms We asked for web authoring and data exploration enhancements we got it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has included an update to make creating and formatting visualizations for dashboards and reports though the browser much much easier We wanted the ability to bring custom visualizations to the platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made Power BI open source via GitHub Further we wanted more visualization options the ability to format by color legend creation label creation etc and we wanted new data source support with integrations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>completely enhanced Desktop to now include all of this We wanted a continuation of content pack integration and availability very importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced new content packs from Adobe Azure comScore Sumo Logic Insightly and so many more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is also allowing Power BI pros and system integrators to build their own packs I cant tell you how huge this is but if youre a Power BI user you already know And what a statement doesnt that make about Power BI Desktop and really the entire companywide push to recapture the nonconsumer demand it once owned I think it further makes clear the newMicrosoft that partners can expect to deal with A company willing to embrace change innovation and best of breed even if it means that isnt inclusive of only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>product All of this culminates in maybe the most important upgrade Power BI will provide support for groups enabling team collaboration and sharing of Power BI content across work groups This is an absolute game changer and something Ive been calling for across the BI space Whether it be Tableau NYSE DATA Watson NYSE IBM or Statistica privately held Dell Inc formerly DELL Ive asked the BI gods for more collaboration Now I dont have specifics as to what the collaboration will encompass entirely but what I do know is it will be enough to swing the pendulum of best of breed in Power BIs direction Maybe this is going to take me using the update to figure out if Tableau has serious competition on its hands What we do know from a collaboration standpoint is that Power BI has created a quasichat function in which groups can view and alter data This isnt what I think is the game changer and this isnt unique to Power BI What is however as far as I know and I have at least a base level of familiarity with all the BIs Ive mentioned is that Power BI will now allow full Excel support enabling users to both import Excel workbooks to build Power BI dashboards and reports as well as view these workbooks through Excel Online as part of the Power BI experience Plus if the collaboration update is inclusive of not just the group workbook capacity but also a chat function inapp I would think Power BI will be the platform of choice Ive recently opined that Tableau should consider a merge with Slack and even went further to say that salesforcecom NYSE CRM should buy Slack at any reasonable valuation all in an effort to establish a platform as the collaboration platform Collaboration in my opinion is the missing piece to a BI being differentiated and the platform of dominance I just think that would set a platform apart It appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might be a first mover but again that much is unknown at this point All told though this summer update was more than I could have expected I think it speaks extremely well to the newMicrosoft that Ive promoted in this article and that Nadella has promised the world I also think Power BI can become exactly what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs it to become an introduction to the broader productivity suite and a base platform for ancillary revenue segments Say what you will about some of the other core competencies at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and some are more than deserving of the welladvertised criticism but the SMBenterprise segment is gaining momentum and is becoming a mission critical set of apps I find myself more and more impressed with the suite as the company updates it and as I become more familiar with the overall cross functionality Im bullish Power BI and Desktop and Im bullish what it can do for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a whole Ill continue to update readers as new developments take place Source <span style='background-color:
