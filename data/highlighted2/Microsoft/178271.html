class='textDiv'>Reduced Rates For iCloud Primarily Impact Box Box NYSEBOX Seeking Alpha Apples new iCloud prices are part of the commoditization trend in the consumer cloud storage services market The leading competitors have strong ecosystems and leading branded apps Box has improved its reach within Fortune companies in the last few quarters The company should strive to lead the business segment and become a follower in the consumer segment to succeed in the long term In its September th event Apple NASDAQ AAPL introduced a number of exciting new products that include the new iPhone iPad and Apple TV devices that took most of the attention in this event However I want to focus on another announcement Apple made that day that might receive less attention but has wide implications over some companies the new iCloud plans The new iCloud plans could have probably gone unmentioned unless the company introduced a significant drop in its upgrade plan prices The new prices are highly competitive and mostly on par with competition as shown in the table below per user per month Dropbox for Business per month includes Office subscription Apples iCloud is primarily a personal cloud storage service targeted at common consumers Lets see what the competitive landscape in the consumer segment is Basicfree tier This is the free offering that every service provides new subscribers that is used to attract new users before they need to upgrade This tier allows consumers to test the service before they commit to any price plan Consumers with very small storage requirements use this tier as their favorite choice In this tier Apple is behind most players when it offers only GB free when the others offer GB to GB for free However Apples offering is higher than Dropboxs free GB In this segment each service is likely to keep their current customers as users usually prefer a service that best fits their OS and storage requirements Medium tier This tier contains the GB to GB plans that common consumers usually purchase Apple offers two price points in this tier for GB and for GB while Google offers only GB for and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offers GB for and GB for For the GB Apple offers a better price However the interesting thing in this segment is Boxs offering which is for GB Users that had only Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a better alternative in this segment can now choose iCloud Consumers who didnt prefer Google Drive or OneDrive over Box in spite of the significantly lower price could choose iCloud In my opinion this will drive consumers in this segment from Box to Apple Performancehighend tier This tier includes the TB plans for heavy personal users In this segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has the best offer with while Google Apple and Dropbox offer a plan Box has no offering in this size for personal storage Apple is obviously trying to be more competitive at this price point However I expect only a small shift from Google or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and a more significant shift of customers from Dropbox to Apples iCloud The new iCloud pricing will probably have very little impact on Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Amazon as they have particular features that are preferred by certain consumers OS compatibility ecosystem interaction with popular apps ease of use and pricing Dropbox and Box are unique players in the cloud storage market as cloud storage is their core business and while they have a broad partnership network they dont have popular branded productivity apps like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Excel Google Sheets and Apple Numbers in the spreadsheets app for example that are used as default services Hence they are highly dependent on their network and their marketing While Dropbox remains competitive in all consumer segments Box has a highly attractive offering in one segment and is totally absent in another I dont think this is happening by mistake Box understands perfectly that the consumer cloud storage segment is going through accelerated commoditization and it would be very hard for the company to compete with Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Apple and Amazon in the consumer market when they have such a strong ecosystem in this segment In the Q earnings release Box mentioned that of Fortune companies and of Global companies use Boxs solutions Box presents a gradual increase in these two factors as well as more registered users and larger partnership networks As I mentioned above I believe the consumer cloud services market is going through an accelerated process of commoditization where Apple Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Amazon offer very attractive pricing Box cannot get into pricing wars with these giants in the slowing consumer market To win in the long term Box should strive to become a leader in the consumer segment while transforming to a follower in the consumer market In the enterprisebusiness segment Box should become more competitive increase its network and ecosystem as it did lately with the IBM NYSE IBM partnership and rebuild the company as an enterprisefocused service At the same time while consumer prices drop rapidly Box should remain competitive so it will not become obsolete and match its prices to its competitors In the event that Box becomes a leader in the enterprise segment in a few years time it could then invest in the consumer segment once again For investors interested in benefiting from the expected surge in cloud storage Box at its current price might be an attractive longterm alternative Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than
