Central station in New York City July SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc faces significant challenges selling its larger and more powerful iPad Pro to businesses because companies are reluctant to switch software vendors and use an expensive device that lacks specialized business apps analysts said Theyve tried to focus on the enterprise but over the last two years it has really not been successful said Daniel Ives a senior analyst at FBR Capital Markets The enterprise market which is how Apple refers to its business customers represents percent of its billion annual revenue he said Apple has at least one client so far General Electric has given some of its employees the option to use Apple devices at work with iPads and iPhones now available in their offices It is not clear how much this is worth for Apple nor how it generates about billion a year from the enterprise market Apple officials declined to comment on plans to market iPads to business customers referring queries to a product announcement event that happened Sept At that event Phil Schiller Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing said the iPad Pro was faster than percent of portable PCs signaling that Apple may think the device could replace workplace laptops from companies like Dell and HP Schiller called the iPad Pro ideal for professional productivity Selling tablets to corporate buyers is an attractive option for Apple amid slowing global iPad sales which have fallen for two quarters Research firm Forrester projects that sales to businesses will represent as much as percent of the overall tablet market by compared to percent this year as the market grows from million units to million units The iPad Pro is important for Apple because theyre beginning to saturate the personal device space and its a logical step for the company if they wish to expand their market share said Michael Yoshikami head of Destination Wealth Management which has billion under management and owns Apple shares The price of its products is one obstacle Apple faces as it tries to move deeper into the enterprise market The iPad Pro starts at but costs more than if buyers also want a keyboard and an optional stylus Thats more than Apples existing tablets as well as devices made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corp and other PC makers like Lenovo Its about the same price as Apples own MacBook Air a laptop The iPad Pros biggest competitor is likely Microsofts inch Surface Pro also geared towards the business market While the Surface has the same starting price as the iPad Pro Apple charges extra for a keyboard and stylus In July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said its Surface line of tablets brought in million in the most recent quarter up percent from the same time last year boosted in largest part by the Surface Pro and the launch of Surface The most formidable opposition to adoption is price The iPad Pro has a lot of utility and technology that Apple brought to bear but unfortunately the price never goes away as a challenge said Keith Bachman a senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets Its also not clear how Apple is going to expand their sales to businesses as only a few companies like GE have made any significant investment to switch to Apple devices said JP Gownder a Forrester principal analyst At GE which gives employees the option of using Apple devices at work just of its office workers using computers on a regular basis use a Mac In the meantime Apple has entered into partnerships with IBM and Cisco aimed at creating more enterprisefriendly software to run on iOS the Apple operating system but little is known about these partnerships The iPad Pro is going to be a real accelerator for our partnership and Apple as well said Katharyn White IBMs vice president of strategy and markets for the company and Apples partnership Clients that have seen it and are thinking about it are really excited about it A Forrester survey last year of more than office workers found that they still rely heavily on laptops at the workplace and estimated that global information workers are three times more likely to use them for longer than four hours per day than tablets Finally analysts say that the vast majority of companies use custombuilt applications and databases that are still not compatible with Apples iOS and are unlikely to switch to Mac devices GE has an internal group dedicated to developing applications that can run on Apples mobile devices and IBM and Apple are developing a number of iOS applications for enterprise clients in industries ranging from banking to healthcare But for most companies Gownder said You still cant run all your businesscritical applications through Apple Gownder wrote in a report on Thursday that technology decisionmakers currently favor Windows over iOS for ease of support by percent to percent Enterprises have spent billions on applications that are unique to their business and having apps from IBM doesnt change that fact overnight he said Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world news business news
