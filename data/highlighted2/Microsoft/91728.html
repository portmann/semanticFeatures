class='textDiv'>The Future Of Apple Hinges On The Mac Upsell Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha The legacy of the Mac will continue to live on Whats important is not how much revenue the Mac generates but how well it complements the user experience In other words the value add of being a Mac user is directly proportional to the number of other Apple devices you own Therefore the Mac will continue to grow and while tech pundits think differently they have this one wrong Im going to try something a little different here and offer some commentary in light of some clever speculation from a WSJ journalist who by my definition is a very talented writer and is an astute observer of technology But not withstanding his skill as a writer and logic I have to disagree with what Christopher Mims had published in a column subscription required at link last week from which I quote But lets put that in perspective In the quarter ending in January of this year a funny thing happened at Apple The company took in the highest revenue for its Mac line ever yet the Mac accounted for the lowestever proportion of overall revenue Apple raked in billion on million Macs just of overall revenue This would be a crazy thing to say for any other company but Apple doesnt need this revenue Which is precisely why Apple should kill off what is perhaps its mostrefined brand The Mac The thought process to that is absolutely baloney and while Im almost certain hes borrowing from the logic of Jim Collins the author of Good to Great theres potential for companies to broaden their scope of effort while maintaining the core competency of the organization Sure narrowing the focus on areas where a company can truly be exceptional is one of many ways in which a company can succeed but in my view a company that succeeds in the early stages of their growth phase dont have many resources and by definition must focus on a few areas due to opportunity cost But when you reach the scale of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and have billion in assets on the financial statement being a steward of capital not only involves the company to be proficient managers they must also look for every opportunity in which they can growth their business to the benefit of their shareholders If anything Apple needs to do anything it possibly can to propup the top line growth rate without creating low margin opportunities for itself PCs are not a low margin business not for Apple at least so theres no reason to scale that business back or divert resources away from Macs into iPads and iPhones They also contribute to the top line growth rate whereas iPads have gone nowhere for the past three or four consecutive fiscal years The Mac business still has strategic value as Apple has a portfolio of products it can crosssell or in the case of Macs upsell consumers into Upon being an owner of two Macs two iPads and one iPhone I have to say that the way in which the various devices interact inclusive of Apple apps is what creates a unique platform experience This is what differentiates the Mac from Android and Windows A platform of devices connected to the computer allowing users to cross the various screens with the same data and some of the same apps intact And while we live in a postPC era in which new devices and experiences will alter the scope and capabilities of a computer it doesnt mean that the desktop or laptop form factor has become primitive In other words the drop off in broader PC demand isnt solely attributable to tablet growth but rather cyclical factors in which the market is having difficulty with absorbing supply in certain parts of the cycle The PC cycle is different from the broader market cycle and will invariably have its ups and downs In the end Im certain that growth will eventually stabilize as demand for more powerful computers with more established software ecosystems will come back into the forefront of what I would call a revival of the desktop and laptop form factor Furthermore the Mac is going to grow as iPhone users will soon adopt the Mac for its intended purpose of getting work done People in the younger age demographic eventually grow up and will get a job and when they get hired theyre going to be confronted with the dingy Windows PC or semihipster Mac I think many will buy the Mac Its no longer a branding cachet in which the marketers have to come up with some new brand slogan to explain why a Mac is better than a PC Based on the persons own experience with an iPhone the natural conclusion is to assume that Mac OS X is better than Windows Therefore the Mac will gradually gain customers because its way easier to crosssell after establishing a phenomenal experience in other device categories PCs are an inescapable fact of life and when confronted with options any rational human being would buy a Mac over a PC When confronted with investment decisions I would say Apple is a better stock than <span style='background-color:
