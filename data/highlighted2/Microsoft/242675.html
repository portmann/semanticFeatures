pointed to obvious exceptions such as the inability to run some PC software available for Windows and Mac OS X Recently contributors to SA as well as other writers have taken issue with a statement by Apple NASDAQ AAPL CEO Tim Cook that iPad Pro could replace a notebook PC Somehow being able to replace a notebook has become the standard by which the iPad Pro is to be judged But I doubt this really makes sense especially for investors wanting to gauge the iPad Pros market potential Its important to note that Cook qualified his statement regarding the Pro in a recent interview with The Telegraph Yes the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many many people They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else other than their phones So Cook wasnt trying to argue that the Pro could replace a laptop or desktop computer for everyone He was simply making an observation that has already been true about the iPad for some time For people with relatively undemanding computer needs such as checking email web surfing and watching videos the iPad alone can meet their needs Since its introduction the iPad has gradually become more powerful both in terms of processor hardware and in terms of iOS capability So iPads role has expanded and the Pro just takes that a step further iPad Pro features the AX SOC which is roughly comparable in capability to lowend Intel NASDAQ INTC Core M processors Skylake gen The iPad Pro also features the true multitasking capability of iOS The range of usage scenarios is therefore much greater and yes for many more people than before the iPad Pro can replace a general purpose PC At the same time Cooks statements regarding convergence amount to an acknowledgement that iPad Pro is not a universal notebook or PC replacement In another interview with independentie Cook continued to reiterate his stance We feel strongly that customers are not really looking for a converged Mac and iPad Because what that would wind up doing or what were worried would happen is that neither experience would be as good as the customer wants So we want to make the best tablet in the world and the best Mac in the world And putting those two together would not achieve either Youd begin to compromise in different ways Given Apples position on the matter of convergence I dont think it really makes sense to evaluate iPad Pro on the basis of it not being something Apple doesnt intend it to be Yet this is essentially what Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Pitti does in Apple iPad Pro Is A Bust Pitti concludes Apples failed iPad Pro launch signifies a need to merge iOS and Mac OS X to create a product that runs the necessary applications to be a laptop replacement Mr Pittis conclusion of failure seems a little premature Its not at all clear that iPad Pro will not stem the decline in iPad sales this quarter Most Pro models are now backordered approximately two weeks indicating strong iPad demand KGI Securities analyst MingChi Kuo has predicted iPad Pro sales of million units this quarter The point of the iPad Pro is not to replace the PC its to expand the total addressable market of Apples iPad series of products It does that in much the same way iPhone expanded the market for iPhone by offering a larger screen and more powerful capabilities I believe Kuo is being a tad conservative but clearly supplydemand balance has not been achieved I am sympathetic to Pittis fundamental assertion that Apple should merge iOS and OS X Sympathetic but not in agreement Ive stated numerous times that I believe the process of convergence between tablet and personal computer is underway regardless of what Tim Cook or anyone else has to say about it iOS features numerous personal computer features such as multitasking and hints at more to come such as cursor support the track pad mode for the onscreen keyboard Ive also said that theres no fundamental point to maintaining separate PC and tablet operating systems in the long run In my view each of the three mobile OS providers is on its own unique path of convergence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has chosen to base its converged platform on its PC OS Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL appears to want to place its bet on Android which already provides desktoplike mouse and track pad support I believe Apples approach is to continually evolve iOS to be more and more capable until it subsumes OS X even as Apple maintains OS X and computers based on it as a separate product line This has advantages and disadvantages The key advantage is that iOS is a more modern platform than OS X Its inherently more secure by virtue of requiring all apps to be dispensed through the Applecontrolled App Store This also places significant limits on the type of third party APIs that developers can use which also improves security as well as consistency of user experience The key disadvantage is in software availability This is really the fundamental criticism that reviewers have of the iPad Pro Desktop apps such as Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Creative Cloud that are available in Mac OS X and Windows simply arent available on the Pro Given the huge and growing ecosystem of iOS apps Im not convinced that this is as serious a limitation as is supposed I expect software availability to improve over time for professional users Either Adobe and other companies will fully port their PC apps or other developers will swoop in to fill the gap As an Apple developer and investor I do wish Apple was a little less dogmatic on the issue of operating system purity This is not a cause I find particularly inspiring Mac OS X laptops could be easily endowed with touchscreens and Im certain that Mac OS X would do a better job supporting a touchscreen than Windows This would give users the benefits of the touchscreen combined with access to apps not available in iOS But its clear thats not going to happen and perhaps it doesnt need to in the long run I believe Apple is much more interested in investing in iOS than Mac OS X precisely because it is the more modern and secure platform as well as the far more successful and lucrative platform So the fact that iOS isnt yet the doeverything personal computing platform probably doesnt matter It will get there eventually The fact that iPad Pro isnt a PC replacement for everyone is kind of a red herring The importance of the Pro is that its the next step in the evolutionary process of iPad and iOS I believe its going to find a much larger market than many expect and like iPhone will unlock pent up demand for a larger screen iPad that has held back sales of iPad for the past couple of years Supply constraints will undoubtedly limit sales for the December quarter However I expect those constraints to be relieved in calendar Q when I expect sales to exceed the December quarter significantly rather than subside as Kuo has predicted I remain long
