</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation has continued to trail higher in both price and valuation It has become increasingly clear that cloud will dictate the future of this company The key challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is differentiation of cloud services In my last analysis of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQ MSFT I argued that the company stood to either grow or decline significantly in the coming months With the company trading at premium valuations investors are clearly expecting big things from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and anticipating that the company will deliver on its promises In the last month we see that both price and valuation relative to earnings and cash flow have continued to rise However I must admit that I had somewhat misjudged the main drivers behind such growth Previously I had argued that desktopbased products such as Windows have been significant drivers behind growth for the company However Windows actually accounted for only percent of the companys overall revenue Instead server and cloudbased sales have been the main driver of cash generation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Moreover I had pointed out that Office had been performing significantly well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>However it is the cloudbased capability of this product that has helped bolster sales While I had expressed concern that low mobile sales could be a threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>this is not Microsofts main ball game Even Steve Ballmer has acknowledged that Android has the upper hand in mobile applications and Windows phones would need to run the Android platform to be competitive Therefore as we go forward we can expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will increasingly focus on cloud services as a focal point of its overall business Specifically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has kept its eye on the fact that the primary users of its products are not average Windows users like you are me they are small and largescale businesses Indeed the main draw behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at this point in time is that services like Office and Visual Studio for application development have now become cloudbased This means that collaboration which could have only previously taken place across individual machines are now centralized in the cloud this is a big draw for companies which are already heavily invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>software Specifically while Amazon Web Services NASDAQ AMZN has had the firstmover advantage in developing its cloud ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could end up becoming the second mouse that gets the cheese Microsofts main advantage in this context is product specialization with cloudbased service Azure providing access to specialized products such as Cortana Visual Studio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Sharepoint and Windows Server among others while providing access to more mainstream programming tools such as API Hadoop and SQL In this regard I see Microsofts success as critically resting on how much further the company can differentiate its cloudbased offerings For businesses that have already invested significantly in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>this could mark a big opportunity for the company to take back market share from Amazon which currently leads in this market So to revisit the original question can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>keep growing at these rates My answer is that it depends on the degree of differentiation of the companys cloud services Should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>succeed in integrating its specialized software as part of a broader cloud ecosystem then the company could well outperform its competitors and grow further However there also is the risk that cloud services could become increasingly commoditized in which instance I would expect that current levels for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will become unsustainable Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
