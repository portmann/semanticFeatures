even slightly Q guidance was very low by AMD and will easily be beaten AMDs GPU market share has bottomed and will show market share increases in Q For computer companies there is no better indicator of future stock price than the technology they have There are other factors of course but this is the most salient Some of the other factors include the price of the stock and the history of how it reacts to news The markets the company is in also play a role as well as current expectations for the company I have said for well over a year was going to be extremely difficult for AMD NASDAQ AMD and the company has not disappointed with egregious losses and very weak guidance But that put the stock where it is now So why write an article about why now is a good time to buy AMD Part of it is that price At the time of this writing AMD is selling for a share Yes there are reasons for this including a dismal Yes there is heavy debt Yes the PC market is declining Yes AMD is not going to release any significantly new technology for probably a year There will be people that will even show by this or that metric AMD is actually expensive The reality is different because judging the stock by common parameters ignores the enormous potential of the company This is primarily because it is one of two companies VIA is essentially irrelevant that can sell x processors The PC market is still huge and so is the x server market so this is an extremely important consideration The company is also one of two companies making powerful GPUs which is also a very large market Because of this the potential upside for a company with AMDs low market cap is enormous and the market reacts very strongly to any positive news Put another way its much more likely AMD will double than go to We only need to look at the history of the stock price even recently to see this is patently true Intel NASDAQ INTC is having problems significantly improving its products in the PC market Weve seen Intels nm process didnt improve performance much if at all and Skylake was only a very small improvement over Broadwell which was a very small improvement over Haswell This is not to discredit Intel it is likely the design is at the point where further improvement is very difficult But it also gives AMD a reasonable chance of creating competitive performance with the next generation Zen processor Keeping in mind this is a brand new design on Samsungs OTCSSNLF nm FinFET process with a very well established processor designer Jim Keller its essentially certain it will close the gap with Intel in Clearly right now is the best competitive situation Intel will be in for the foreseeable future and will cease to be the case sometime in I wasnt expecting so many examples of design wins with Carrizo so am still somewhat surprised by the announcements we keep seeing While clearly not as good as Intels best devices nor in nearly as many designs it still apparently performs well enough to be attractive at certain price points Perhaps the biggest example of this is AMDs ongoing relationship with Apple NASDAQ AAPL with respect to GPUs particularly with professional devices This not only sells products but does give AMD credibility which it has lacked in the professional market Its also important to note that OEMs do not want AMD to disappear into irrelevance They remember all too well Intels behavior when completely in control and a stronger AMD gives them better leverage It is also worth bringing up that AMD has pushed the market forward in a very positive way with technologies like Mantle HSA HBM FreeSync etc This is not to suggest that OEMs are willing put out products they believe will not be attractive just to help AMD However in close situations this bias can have some impact One of the more egregious aspects of AMDs Q conference call was the very light revenue guidance for Q indicating a revenue increase Considering Q had several nonrecurring negative factors and Q is seasonally the strongest for console chips this guidance not only can be but will be beaten One of those negative factors was the impact of Windows Lisa Su mentioned in the conference call that some design wins had been delayed from Q to Q because of this Also although its not clear whether Windows will promote significant customer purchases we do know OEMs leaned out inventory in anticipation of its release Those inventory levels should increase slightly and return to normality Another significant improvement in Q will that AMD finished clearing out downstream channel inventory in Q which negatively impacted sales Q will also be the first full quarter that Carrizo is generating revenue and given the number of OEM design wins this should improve AMDs situation in the PC market slightly Perhaps most importantly towards the end of Q AMD released significant GPU products This included not only the Fury line but also the R xx series of cards While the latter are relatively minor refreshes buyers often delay purchases when new releases are imminent This is not only true for those who are considering the newer product but also for those who believe they will the price for the current product will go down when the newer ones are released Much of this is perception but not all The Fury line appears to have moved past the supply issues it had and in any event will be available for the entire quarter not just the very end Also the Fury Nano is an extremely attractive product It is just my opinion and time may prove it false but the Nano could easily be the most successful of the Fury products despite it being largely viewed as a niche product Why Its elegant Its efficient Its powerful without being power hungry Its also taking the best dies cherry picked to perform well even with lower power Although the price is high AMD finally has a product better at many things than NVIDIA NASDAQ NVDA at any price Its a great product with performance per watt parameters that greatly exceed anything AMD had prior to this I doubt the GPU virtualization technology AMD released is going to have a huge sales impact as its a niche within a small market professional graphics but it does improve AMDs feature set and how it is perceived This is also something that could become more important as support around it develops and scenarios become more visible Last and most importantly DX has dramatically changed the relative performance in the mainstream PC market If you wondered why AMD beat NVIDIA to win consoles one reason was the GPU architecture was more intelligent and more flexible With relatively weak CPUs this was particularly important in consoles Many thought AMDs win in consoles would correlate to better support in PC games If this happened it was never apparent The reason seems more clear now console developers had to use more efficient APIs on their consoles whereas they were confronted by the considerably different and less efficient DX on PCs It also gives a much clearer picture of AMDs strategy This is a very intelligent coherent plan although it sometimes did not appear so due to the lack of information we had Considering the lead times its very possible AMD developed GCN fully aware it would be used in situations where the processor was not very powerful Of course this is the case in the consoles As mentioned this was likely an important consideration for both Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>either unable to or unwilling to move to a more efficient programming model in the PC market AMD essentially forced them to by developing themselves and making it broadly available <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>certainly did not wish to lose control over the API which would have made code less difficult to port to other platforms so were forced to offer something comparable NVIDIA made their hardware much more tuned for Microsofts then current software environment This allowed greater efficiency than AMDs products which had powerful features which could not be utilized effectively and thus took up space and used power to poor effect Even so this was not a mistake as the consoles were worth it DX has changed this materially At first I wanted to see more benchmarks even though all indications were that DX should perform better on AMD hardware relatively speaking The spat between NVIDIA and Oxide further validated this assessment clearly indicating the weakness of NVIDIAs technology with DX There is little or no doubt that AMD will gain market share in Q from NVIDIA for all these factors Although DX games will be far and few between initially AMD products are more futureproof in a sense Also because companies have been using features like Asynchronous Computing on consoles for quite some time its reasonable to expect an easier learning curve than would otherwise be the case The perception that AMD is better for future software environments makes for a much more favorable impression than the company had in Q The long term reward justifies the risk As many know AMD will be releasing a completely new x design called Zen in as well a new GPU architecture both on FinFETs While we do not currently know the performance should Zen be competitive AMDs prospects will change enormously The current situation where Intels Core processor line is greatly superior allows AMD little hope of improving significantly in the PC market Theres little doubt Zen will minimally significantly close the performance gap which in itself would help AMDs position Should the performance gap be eliminated or quite small the opportunities for the company are so significant the stock could go up many times its current price Its also well known that AMD GPU technology is very old with Fury being just a tweaked Tonga and Tonga just a tweak itself should bring with a significantly redesigned GPU It will also bring with it greater DX adoption by game makers These offer an excellent opportunity for substantial growth We do not currently have a clear indication of how attractive either technology will be but the cost to throw the dice is very low compared to the reward if they land right All in all for all the above reasons this is a very good opportunity to invest in AMD While there are always risks with any stocks they pale in comparison with the potential awards at the current price Disclosure I amwe are long AMD
