class='textDiv'>Windows Shaping Up To Be A Disaster For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Windows had a bit of a shaky start due to a neverending reboot loop caused by an update The mandatory update process plays into why the OS goes into this neverending loop The change in policy has become a doubleedged sword However Windows does come with a lot of new bells and whistles The adoption of Windows has been rather strong and is projected to reach millionplus users Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still in the early innings of its OS launch which is why Im not quite ready to hit the panic button yet Windows could be a game a changer for shareholders right Making an investment based on those assertions could prove faulty as Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT revenue is more diversified than ever in its year history However theres no denying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could come out a winner with its recently released OS so as long as they continue with the mandatory updates and actually do something with those updates aside from minor security patches and bug fixes However the mandatory update is proving to be a doubleedged sword On one hand it prevents a fractionalized user base whereby a small minority runs the latest version and the rest run on older OS versions Keeping an updated OS creates numerous benefits and allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to release new programs as a part of the OS bundle to immediate effect However Apple NASDAQ AAPL has been able to move users to new OS versions without forcing mandatory updates upon them Updates should be voluntary and communicating the advantages to moving over to a newer version should take higher priority However not every tech company has the ability to attract crowds to formal tech events In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt have the means to communicate a finetuned message that clearly highlights all the advantages to an updated version of Windows so making the update mandatory could help insulate the Windows ecosystems from Mac OS However in the early goings of a new OS you inevitably run into problems and the mandatory updates sit at the center of it This problem is driven by patch KB the naming cadence of Microsofts patches are horrible The patch in question is KB ironically enough a rollup of bug fixes and during its update process affected users find it fails and triggers the message We couldnt complete the updates undoing the changes Undoing them results in a mandatory system reboot but as soon as the user logs back on Windows s update process kicks in and tries to install KB again Somehow Microsofts mandatory update creates this neverending reboot loop Because the update failed it will work backwards to correct the issue but to do this the OS must reboot The PC attempts to update to the patch fails goes back and reboots again and again Ive had a couple issues with my MacBook after installing two additional monitors but never have I been stuck inside of a reboot loop before Sitting through Groundhog Day would be an irksome experience especially for everyday users wanting a functional PC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has yet to respond and quite frankly I think malware would be more preferable to a continually failing booting sequence That being the case people have been able to create a workaround to the problem However the solution is somewhat risky and requires you to delete a registry key Not a solution for people who barely made it past basic computer information sciences and unlike Apple Microsofts support for its OS and its products isnt as comprehensive If you own a Mac you simply take the thing to a Genius bar Chances are the Apple technician will fix the thing for free within the first year of owning the device In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>you would probably have to pay a massive premium to get it fixed by Geek Squad which rips you apart in ongoing costs Again casual users which I refer to as at the mass market will not know how to troubleshoot this problem and will pay a lot of money to an IT professional so they can address the problem by deleting the registry key Windows was supposed to be a smooth launch but the ongoing efforts to improve the Windows experience have created bumps along the road I just didnt anticipate the change in update policy to create such a massively awful user experience Either you have a mandatory update policy or not but my gut is telling me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will stick with mandatory updates for the time being Meanwhile I can imagine Apple starting a new ad campaign dubbed The Mac It just works You dont have to skip the ad because the ad is already over I know Apple wont use the same marketing lingo and will continue down a path where they continue to emphasize the number of pixels across a K Retina Screen and laugh at Android for attempting to create a decent mobile OS However the marketing folks over at Apple have fresh ammunition to launch a firestorm in the direction of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which will compound into more PR problems That being the case there is some light at the end of the tunnel Windows has many more features than Windows and starting with Direct X which will boost performance by This should provide some relief to GPU vendors who have reported declining sales Also casual gaming will come to the PC through Xbox streaming which is reported to be both fast and responsive The OS comes with a virtual assistant called Cortana which allows you to interact with other apps like Outlook and Calendar and also allows you to search the web Windows comes with Edge Browser which is suppose to be Chromelike but the jury is still out on that one Furthermore better security from malware and spyware and the universal app ecosystem along with a start menu thats inclusive of metrobased tabs Of course many of you are aware of this but after starting the article so negatively I need to hype up some of Microsofts recent accomplishments with Windows Furthermore analysts are projecting that because Windows is free for preexisting OSlicenses adoption could reach million within the first year according to Computer World If the adoption rates are that strong users may choose to upgrade to a newer computer based on the feature additions and the assumed advantages newer hardware will bring The stock hasnt responded to the negative news However investors did perceive the M downloads and ongoing adoption of Windows positively In other words the good seems to outweigh the bad The ecosystem is gaining momentum across gaming tablets mobile and PCs Going forward Microsofts monetization model around the OS may have to change but for the time being the strategy seems to be working Sure the launch of Windows could have been better but the positive sentiment from the media and the ongoing adoption of Windows from preexisting licensees reasserts why Windows will continue to be the platform for mainstream PC users
