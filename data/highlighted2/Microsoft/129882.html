we look at inflation adjusted numbers Apples share price can grow even if the market capitalization remains flat due to buybacks Apple is the better investment in comparison to the tech company basket by every metric of relevance I read an article here on Seeking Alpha named Buying Apple Consider The Scale Of The Potential Investment In this article the author Intrepid Investor argues that Apple NASDAQ AAPL with a market cap of billion might be the inferior investment in comparison to a basket of other companies valued at billion This basket consists of Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Intel NASDAQ INTC Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE TSM Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM SAP NYSE SAP Baidu NASDAQ BIDU and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ As you can see those are seven tech companies as well so the comparison between the two baskets seems fair The author argues that Apple will likely be the inferior investment due to the fact that things tend to stop growing once they reach a certain size and that the basket of the seven other tech companies is a better choice due to the fact that those seven have a higher total amount of retained earnings on their balance sheet His first point is obviously true a company will never be able to grow its revenues at a pace higher than global GDP growth forever since otherwise it would one day be responsible for every dollar generated in the whole world This however does not mean that Apple will not be able to grow at an above average pace for the next years and neither does it mean that Apples shares will not see continuing growth over time Despite being the biggest company in the world by market capitalization using nominal dollar values Apples share of global GDP is still very small and could easily grow further Apples trailing revenues of billion make up just a small portion of the global GPD of trillion thats billion or more than times Apples revenues In addition to the fact that Apple could easily grow its revenues further and there are other companies with higher revenues eg WalMart NYSE WMT Apples market cap also could grow through multiple expansion as Apples PE multiple is below market average And lastly market cap expansion is not even necessary for share price gains As Apple keeps buying back a lot of shares over time share prices and thus the value of an investors investment increase even if the market capitalization remains flat see this article Also Apples size is not the biggest the world has ever seen when we use real dollar values instead of nominal dollar values Just over the last few years there were a couple of companies which sported higher market capitalizations than Apple does now The highest one of those was Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT inflationadjusted market cap of billion in Apple thus has about percent to go before it reaches that level The difference here is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been valued at more than times earnings whereas Apples current earnings multiple is about If Apples valuation would grow the same way Microsofts did years ago Apple would be valued several trillion dollars right now But even Microsofts market cap is not the highest ever eg Rockefellers Standard Oil Company was worth north of trillion at its all time high when we adjust for inflation Saudi Aramco Saudi Arabias state oil company which is not publicly traded is even more valuable University of Texas Sherida Titman estimates the giants value at trillion more than five times Apples market cap When we go even further back in history we reach even higher values the biggest among them was held by the Dutch East India Company founded which sported an inflation adjusted market capitalization of trillion more than ten times Apples current size We thus can conclude that despite Apples size the company is still far from the inflation adjusted market capitalizations some companies have seen over the past centuries and nonpublic Saudi Aramco is still seeing right now Another point is that Apples market capitalization doesnt have to increase a lot in order for substantial gains for Apples shareholders the reason being Apples buybacks about which I wrote an article here As an example When Apple spends billion on share repurchases the companys market capitalization should remain relatively flat but the share price increases about seven percent since earnings per share grow seven percent as well Since Apple has a huge cash position and produces huge cash flows Apple has a lot of money it can spend on share repurchases Investors will thus see share price appreciation outpacing market cap growth by a huge margin These points mean that Apple is not too big to invest in as Apple could easily grow further and shareholders will see attractive returns even in case the market capitalization grows only slightly For the second part of this article I want to compare Apple as an investment to the basket of the seven other companies Intrepid Investor stated that Apple was the inferior investment due to the fact that Apples retained earnings were lower than those of the seven other tech companies The fact that Apples retained earnings are lower is true but this is not a metric investors should put a lot of emphasis on From a business point of perspective other metrics are more important by far One of the things an investor buying a company or a basket of companies is looking for is the companys cash as well as equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments When we compare Apple to the basket of the seven other techs we see that Apples total cash position is billion whereas the other seven only have a combined cash position of billion with Cisco contributing the biggest portion A hypothetical investor spending billion would thus rather buy Apple since he gets a higher cash balance for the same price which he then can use for other investments acquisitions etc Another metric an investor would look for is the debt that comes with the investment as the companys debt has to be repaid one day thus tying up the investors cash or cash flows AAPL Total Long Term Debt Quarterly data by YCharts We see that Apple has a longterm debt position of billion whereas the seven other companies have a combined longterm debt position of billion An investor willing to spend billion for an acquisition thus would rather buy Apple as he would acquire more debt if we went for the seven other companies since buying the seven other companies would force him to pay back more debt one day this would be a bigger drain on his cash flows The last point of comparison and the most important one is a companys ability to generate cash flows for the companys owner or owners as it is cash that is used to pay out dividends make acquisitions invest in RD etc AAPL Free Cash Flow TTM data by YCharts When we look at the free cash flows generated by Apple and the seven other companies we see that Apples trailing free cash flow comes in at billion whereas the seven other techs have a combined trailing free cash flow of just billion An investor would thus prefer to spend billion on Apple where he gets a free cash flow yield of percent on his investment instead of spending billion on the seven other techs where he gets a free cash flow yield of just six percent There have been several companies which were bigger than Apple when we look at inflationadjusted numbers Some of them were a lot bigger than Apple is now Apple thus has still a lot of room for growth Apple also seems to be the better investment than the seven tech companies Intrepid Investor suggested since Apple has more cash less debt and generates more cash flow than the seven others combined for the same price I thus conclude that Apple is not too big to grow further neither market cap wise nor share price wise Apple also is not too big to invest in As long as Apple keeps expanding into new markets eg Apple Pay Apple Music the coming car Apple will be able to grow its revenues earnings and cash flows further Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL INTC QCOM MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other
