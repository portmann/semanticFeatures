This is yet another break from my threepart series part one and two on Microns NASDAQ MU hybrid memory cube technology HMC The final article is taking some time because there is just so much change that is going to happen as a result of HMC and the D XPoint memory technology that sits inside of it This change can be summarized as follows when you combine capacious storageclass memory and processor into a single highbandwidth package performance will increase to levels that change the computing landscape The PC itself will disappear because your phone will have more than enough computing power and energy efficiency <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has already developed Continuum so that your display and input can flow across a variety of devices Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone is going to be displaced when businesses and schools provide Windows Phone Computers PCs to the employees and students respectively Or is a MacPhone coming in order to fend this threat The only use case that isnt better served by this model is gaming which is already being folded into Intels Xeon line the Core desktop processors and Xeon server processors already very much similar With D XPoint memory the differences become even smaller because the memory error correction is moved from the processor into the memory Although the mobile group might borrow a Xeon core here and there theres no reason to maintain a desktop computing group anymore What Im getting at is that going forward the Client Computing Group is no longer comprised of separate desktop and mobile components it is just one group that produces processors with storage class memory filling the needs of percent of the personal computing market with very little diversity ie two four or eight cores with between GB and TB of storage class memory put the Legos together and be on with your day The other percent will be gaming and CAD workstations that are fulfilled by the Xeon from the Data Center Group What stands out from the new structure is the NonVolatile Memory Solutions Group They specifically characterized the function as nonvolatile which means that they arent targeting DRAM at all This means that the performance of D XPoint is as high as I believed it to be From an Intel patent application Given the cost structure if D XPoint read speeds are near or equivalent to DRAM read speeds and all writes go into the speedy eDRAM cache then the need for standalone DRAM has just vanished I realize that I am repeating myself but I still feel like nobody is listening Even though this is merely content from Intel and Micron patents people are still doubtful So heres Intels Rick Coulson further explaining the situation in real life We did a little demo a while back where we took a PC and restricted it to megabytes of memory And we ran a sidebyside demo with an gigabytes of memory system You couldnt tell the difference And the little meter on the paging pages a second page misses a second And that was okay if youre fast enough What hes talking about here is virtual memory paging the mechanism that computers use in order to make more efficient use of DRAM by swapping unused pages of memory to disk Historically paging has always been a bad thing because disks including SSDs are so much slower than DRAM But it has always been a necessity in order to make efficient use of a scarce resource The dialer app on my phone is always running for example When I dont use it for a while its memory pages will be moved into storage NAND flash in this example in order to make room in the DRAM for the apps that I am running instead If I then attempt to open the dialer there is a huge delay before it opens This delay happens as a result of the CPU getting the dialer apps pages from NAND and putting them back in memory so it can run Everybody hates paging but Ricks point is that if the secondary storage is fast enough D XPoint in this case then you wont be able to tell the difference and paging wont be a bad thing Processors will come with a little chunk of eDRAM either onchip or very nearby and the rest of the memory system complexity can be discarded a huge chunk of the system cost This was a crude demo that facilitated a quick proof of concept for Intel that as long as the secondary storage is fast enough you cant tell the difference between a system with a lot of DRAM and one with barely any Just before that section he mentions that there is an energy concern Intel has many patents that discuss the problem and theyve subsequently solved it with a technique that they call pinning which just forces the most frequently swapped pages to stay in the cache Now you know how Intel is replacing RAM with SSD as I wrote about in my previous article And now that it is coming from an Intel employee you might actually believe it Intels new Client Computing Group is going to produce products that are remarkably less complex and higher performance than todays CPUs All of the external memory complexity and associated cost will vanish In a different presentation Rick Coulson goes into detail about how demonstrating D XPoint over the NVMe bus is the fundamentally wrong way to demonstrate the performance as the bus is adding more than nanoseconds of latency to a device that has a digit latency even though the technology is times faster than NAND they were only able to demonstrate times faster because of the inefficiencies of using memory on a PCIe bus instead of a memory bus He also mentions that even if D XPoint had infinite performance youd only see less than x of a performance increase versus flash in this sort of a configuration Intel is obviously hiding the performance They could easily demonstrate a memory device if they wanted to show the true performance Why are they sandbagging Theres only a handful of reasons that I can think of They want to keep the specs from their competitors But why announce so early The manufacturer of the firsttoship D XPoint product wants the thunder for themselves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Apple Unfortunately for many employees the layoffs were another step in this
