I initiated a position in MSFT at The stock is trading at recent support and offering investors a dividend yield I discuss the pros and cons of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investment and describe my personal journey that led me to my stake Enjoy If you follow my articles here youve probably noticed a bit of weariness a tinge of anxiety associated with my shortterm market outlook in some of my most recent pieces This slightly bearish stance isnt because Im questioning the quality of the businesses that I own It isnt really about the valuation of the broader market either though I do see certain areas that I consider to be overpriced I worry about currency headwinds that many of the multinationals I hold are facing heading into this upcoming earnings season I wouldnt be surprised to see unexpected misses in Q because of the strength of the dollar and related forex issues But I can deal with earnings misses Actually I rather enjoy them when theyre based upon isolated eventsshortterm macro environment issues The dips that oftentimes ensue from these shortterm situations tend to create valuable buying opportunities for longterm shareholders It is the irrational swings that Im seeing especially in traditionally stable dividend growth names based not on business results but on what has become known as Fed speak related to interest rates that has begun to bother me This unpredictability is worrisome and has caused me to consider taking some profits off of the table That said when managing a dividend growth portfolio the idea of selling shares even after theyve appreciated nicely is a daunting thought because it disrupts ones income stream When making management decisions I have to weigh my top priority protecting the capital with my very close second priority fostering an environment conducive to healthy compounding via the regular reinvestment of reliable increasing dividends When I start feeling a little antsy I have to remind myself that by owning the very high quality companies with predictable earnings and strong commitments towards directly rewarding shareholders with cash I am protecting my capital about as well as one possibly can in an unpredictable market Knowing this allows for me to remain calm and ignore the anxious voices that creep into my head from time to time Although I sometimes question the validity of my holdings and strongly consider taking profits andor liquidating positions whove out performed my expectations for the most part I always sided with the part of me focused on maintaining my income stream rather than the part thats attempting to time the market One of the oldest sayings in the book of successful investment strategies is buy low sell high However this sentiment becomes problematic when you realize that only through hindsight are you able to know whether or not you truly bought low or sold high Im not saying that one should never pull the trigger and sell But what I am saying is that if history is to be used as a guide in the majority of situations the top when it comes to very high quality companies is always in the future It is important to remember this when considering the sale of quality winners Excelsior It is also important to be able to understand the difference between a very high quality company and a very high quality stock For me the first of those two things is absolutely necessary for stock ownership The latter is nearly as important though over the longterm I believe holding high quality companies even if they were bought at somewhat overpriced valuations will end in success This is the nature of very high quality companies in the marketplace they find a way to come out on top That said when an investor is able to find high quality dividend paying companies trading at or even better below their fair values this is the sweet spot for fostering longterm compounding So this run up brings me to a recent trade I made the liquidation of my stake in Conagra NYSE CAG I initiated my CAG position on February th at At the time the stock was yielding The stock had paid out a quarterly dividend for straight quarters needing to increase its dividend soon to continue its current streak of increase annual dividends for consecutive years Unfortunately for shareholders it didnt CAG has now paid a quarterly dividend for consecutive quarters ending its annualized streak and removing itself from the Challengers section of David Fishs US Dividend Champions list When I bought shares I was hoping to see the dividend increase I was happy with the high yield and willing to wait and see I was also happy to have picked up shares after a sharp selloff the stock was trading at in midJanuary of a month later the stock was down after cutting its FY guidance by The extent of this selloff seemed overdone Even with the lowered guidance the stock was trading at x forward earnings at my entry point This was below historical levels for this company and also lower than its peers at the time I felt like this dip was irrational and the stock was due to recover with time because of multiple expansion back to normal levels if nothing else Another thing youve probably noticed if you follow my articles is my passion for responsible food production and healthy eatingliving I believe that the health food trend that has been going on in America over the last several years is not a flash in the pan but is here to stay There is too much scientific data related to the rise of chronic disease being associated with highly processed and unnatural edibles for me to think otherwise Needless to say Conagra isnt the sort of food company that I am overly bullish on moving forward I think CAG and its peers will continue to face growth headwinds and as a longterm investor this segment of the market is not a place I like having my money parked Here is a list of the brands owned by CAG As an investor I like it when I use the products andor services that the companies I own offer in my day to day life it makes the investment seem more personal it also helps me to justify spending money sometimes knowing that Im doing my tinyweeny part to support earnings growth Looking at the brands CAG has to offer I realized that I dont really use any of them I eat a Bertollis frozen dinner from time to time and my absolute favorite nostalgic guilty pleasure is a ChefBoyardee pizza with that wonderful sauce with little pepperonis in it if youve never experienced the joy of ChefBoyardee pizza do yourself a favor and try one make sure to buy extra cheese and toppings because what comes in the box isnt enough I cant tell you how many of these pizzas my parents made for my brother and I growing up It was always a good night in the Ward household on those nights for sure That said boyhood memories aside I typically steer clear of CAGs brands when browsing the grocery store isles So when looking over my holdings considering positions to sell in an attempt to raise cash Conagra stood out The lack of dividend growth was a red flag When a company I own cuts its dividend thats a surefire way to trigger a sell a frozen dividend doesnt make it a foregone conclusion however it doesnt bode well in that companys favor The fact that I was up on my original investment plus the share worth of dividends I have collected from CAG over the previous year also aided me in my sellside thought process Because of the lack of dividend growth and the appreciation in share price the yield had become less attractive as well I would much rather sell a winner than a loser I know others disagree and think its best to let winners run but Id rather lock is profits and lock in losses I sold my shares on March th at CAG was guiding for negative growth again with regard to FY EPS and was trading at x forward estimates I felt like my margin of safety from a fundamental standpoint was diminished and I was happy to exit my stake having executed my original plan With cash in hand I was confident that I would be able to find another undervalued opportunity with better dividend growth prospects It was bound to happen this way I have a history of selling stock at the precisely wrong time This is why I dont do it much I once sold ZipCar shares the day before it was announced they were being acquired by Avis at a hefty premium It just so happens that not one week after I was happily skipping away from my CAG stake money in hand the GBerkshire NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB acquisition of Kraft NASDAQ KRFT was announced fueling a rally across the packaged food industry Conagra took part in this rally and is now worth almost more than it was not long ago when I sold it That skipping was short lived Now obviously I had no way of knowing that this deal was in the works Since Berkshires acquisition of Heinz a few years back I sort of always expected it to continue to add to its food industry exposure These businesses scale well and what better management system and guidance could a company have in place than Berkshires I was selfishly hoping that Buffetts next target would be the JM Smucker Co NYSE SJM I am long SJM and thought that this iconic American company with an B market cap would fit nicely into the cross hairs of Buffetts elephant gun I knew that the unexpected run up that SJM experienced after its Big Heart Pet Brands acquisition earlier in the year hurt these imaginary prospects Buffett likes to buy low not high That said the Kraft news was still a big surprise and I would like to wish a hearty congratulations to all those who were long KRFT later obviously the market didnt foresee this deal happening either Im sure you all are grinning ear to ear Although I was a bit disappointed with the timing of the deal and the extra I missed out on with regard to my CAG sale I was still pleased when reading between the lines of the press release to see evidence that leads me to believe that I am correct about the general direction that this industry is heading especially domestically Kraft Chairman and CEO John Kahill had this to say about the merger This combination offers significant cash value to our shareholders and the opportunity to be investors in a company very well positioned for growth especially outside the United States as we bring Krafts iconic brands to international market Benardo Hees Heinz CEO had this to say We are thrilled about the unique opportunities this merger will create for our consumers worldwide as well as our employees and business partners Together Heinz and Kraft will be able to achieve rapid expansion while delivering the quality brands and products that our consumers love The trend here is the focus on international growth Managing partner at G and Chairman of Heinz Alex Behring mentioned both domestic and international growth when he spoke of the deal but I think it is clear that the major reason this merger makes so much sense is the fact that these companies need less saturated markets for their products Rather than fighting against the headwinds domestically they are taking the path of lease resistance finding growth elsewhere There is speculation that further consolidation will occur and this consolidation will involve premiums paid by the purchaser That said I cant help but wonder if the Kraft deal means that there is one less major buyer in the market now for a large packaged food company Moving OnThere Is No Use Crying Over Spilled Milk Will CAG continue to rally further teaching me a lesson about trying time the market and selling stock Maybe That said even though I would have loved to make that trade this week rather than last I dont regret liquidating a position that wasnt helping me achieve my goal of a reliably increase income stream especially not after a gain When I sold those shares I didnt have a plan for the cash I raised Honestly Im not just saying this because of the KRFT deal I was considering taking the CAG money and moving it directly into KRFT a similar company that offers better dividend growth prospects I like Krafts brand portfolio a bit more than CAGs Ive got a bad habit of eating Kraft Velveeta Mac and Cheese But I wasnt going to sell one company trading at x forward earnings and buy a similar one trading at x forward earnings even if I liked the dividend better No I decided to pass on KRFT and stick with cashanother reason Im a bit sour about this whole deal There is a silver lining though As the packaged foods space rallied the NASDAQ sold off I wasnt necessarily thinking that I would put this cash to work so soon but like I said before Im always happy to buy value when I see it especially when a healthy dividend is involved Ive youve been thinking I clicked on this article to read about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT what gives youre about to get your wish <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has always been on the periphery of my radar Although this is a company that many love to hate because of its perceived under performance in terms of growth especially after it essentially missed the bus when it came to mobile I still believe that MSFT is an American icon worth owning This is the sort of company especially from a dividend growth investing standpoint that I feel comfortable making a core level position in my portfolio This is why after MSFT sold off in just a few days taking it down to the yield threshold I decided to put my CAG cash back to work initiating a position in the company at This purchase equates to roughly half of a full position in my portfolio In a riskoff market environment as an income oriented investor I have three basic options available to me One ignore the perceived risk admit that I have no business attempting to time the market and only make changes to my portfolio when dividends are cut which is essentially an automatic sell trigger two trust my gut and reduce equity exposure moving select positions to cash until valuations drop towards acceptable levels acknowledging that income will be less or three rebalance my holdings moving out of select positions that are deemed lesser quality from either a business or dividend growth standpoint and reallocate those funds towards companies of a higher quality effectively maintaining if not increasing my portfolios ability to generate income while bolstering my defenses I decided to go with the prize behind door number This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>purchase was about improving the quality of my portfolio I believe I have done so from both an overall company quality and dividend growth standpoint This is what the dont over think it series of articles Ive written lately is about understanding and more importantly accepting that for the longterm investor buying and holding high quality companies the other two companies covered in this series were Johnson and Johnson NYSE JNJ and ATT NYSE T when they become available for fair value is in ones best interests Sure it is great to buy these sorts of companies when they are on fire sales This is why I always maintain a cash balance so that I am able to capitalize on the markets folly That said success in the markets doesnt require this sort of perfect timing Investors dont need to stress over squeezing every last drop out of their investment decisions This is what I have to force myself to remember when scanning the market for deals when fair value appears in a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>dont over think it add exposure and let the company work for you MSFTs yield at my purchase price was higher than CAGs yield at my time of sale This is a bonus albeit a small one What really attracts me to MSFT is its fortresslike balance sheet and the dividend growth prospects that this enables it to have In the companys recent Q report MSFT showed B in cash and short term securities on the balance sheet This is up from the B reported one year ago Now most of this money is currently trapped overseas But Im not going to fault the company for that When it comes down to it I feel comfortable owning shares of such a wonderful company Im happy to have bought them on weakness and expect to hold them for a long while Morningstar gives the company a AAA credit rating I consider this to be a defensive holding The company is in the midst of a year annual dividend increase streak and MSFTs yield will be a welcome component of my income stream moving forward MSFT is currently trading slightly below my recent purchase price Shares closed last week at The company is trading down from its recent week high of achieved in November of last year This selloff is based off of a disappointing Q where the company came inline on the top line and beat on the bottom with an EPS of and B in revenues This revenue figure was up almost yy but EPS was down from in Q FY The company claimed a restructuring charge related to Nokia meaning that MSFT management might argue that they did indeed beat on both the top and bottom lines Either way the EPS growth yy was negative and this doesnt bode well for full year EPS growth after the companys negative growth posted in Q last October Yahoo Finance tracks analysts that follow MSFT stock and the average FY EPS estimate is This average estimate is lower than the EPS that MSFT posted for FY That said from a dividend standpoint I dont worry about coverage or growth potential The companys current payout ratio using the forward EPS estimates is MSFTs ttm free cash flowshare is meaning that the current annual dividend payment is safety covered MSFTs year dividend growth rate is The most recent dividend increase was from share to share MSFT typically declares its dividend increases in June and I expect another increase in the range another increase to share would represent a increase anything above that would exceed short term expectations for me But before we get ahead of ourselves back to the disappointing Q earnings report One major concern for investors was the drop to B in commercial licensing revenue This segment of the company makes up roughly of total revenue Its never a good thing when such an important segment posts negative growth The company attempts to gloss over this revenue drop by focusing on the overall commercial revenue which came in at B for the quarter which represents growth yy This growth was aided by Microsofts successful ventures into the cloud space Commercial cloud revenue increased driven by Office Azure and Dynamics CRM Online This is an area where the company expects to see continued growth cloud revenue now equates to a B annual run rate This focus on cloud growth is especially positive in my eyes in light of recent news with regard to lower PC demand across the business sector Intel NASDAQ INTC has withdrawn its forward guidance because of the apparent severity of this issue Shares of Intel are down sharply on the news and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will likely be effected negatively as well It is important that MSFT continues to reinvent itself and I think its success in the cloud space is one of if not the greatest achievement of Satya Nadellas short stint as CEO Investors must decided whether or not they think the continued rise of cloud related revenues will be enough to off set the potential for this negative PC demand to become a longterm trend meaning that this drop in traditional commercial licensing revenue for MSFT would become an ongoing issue rather than an isolated event Ive decided to side with the companys management in this regard Their excitement about the cloud potential and its continued growth has me convinced that for the longterm this is the space to be excelling in MSFT will still rely on commercial licensing for a large portion of its revenue base for some times however I am happy with a more diversified revenue stream and you wont hear me complaining about triple digit growth Another Q negative was MSFTs lowered guidance for Q As quoted by Seeking Alphas market current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>guides for its reporting units to collectively have FQ revenue of BB below a B total revenue consensus Corporateother revenue which totaled M in FQ isnt included in the guidance Forex is expected to hurt revenue growth by Although this lowered guidance is disappointing I see two potential silver linings One being the potential for exceeding low expectations set by conservative guidance And two even in the event that revenue comes in on the low side of this disappointing guidance it will still represent yy growth MSFTs Q revenue in was B To me some growth is better than no growth at all The forex piece isnt surprising to me I think the first half of this year will be tough for all multinational companies I believe that with time these forex issues will sort themselves out with time I dont think that such a strong dollar is the new normal I will continue to monitor MSFTs response to a changing forex environment however my primary focus is on the performance of its business segments and some of the upcoming catalysts I see for the stock Also before I move on I should mention that it wasnt all bad during Q The MSFTs devices and consumer segment posted solid growth to B This performance was lead by Office subscriber growth up Surface revenue came in at B up yy driven by the Surface Pro And lastly and probably most unexpectedly for me search revenue grew with Bing capturing a market share up basis points yy If Im being honest I dont even remember the last time I considered using Bing My mind it hard wired to type in Google I am excited about the upcoming Windows launch This could be a pivotal moment in MSFTs history especially coming off of a disappointing Windows OS It seems to me that Windows will be revolutionary in its ability to mesh well with consumers lives This OS is slated to span across all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>devices that one might use on a day to day basis To me this is why iOS has been so effective over the years the interconnectivity is available within the ecosystem on Apple products This is the way of the world This is what the market expects these days for their devices to seam flawlessly together improving the efficiency of their lives This is MSFTs plan Their slogan for the new OS is Windows isnt for all of us but for each of us I am also intrigued by the companys aggressive stance on implementing this new OS in the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is giving consumers a free upgrade offer for qualifying Windows Windows and Windows Phone devices that upgrade in the first year of the new system This upgrade will be supported for the life of the current device The fact that the company is willing to give the new system away to the majority of the current MSFT devices out there means that the company is confident about consumer acceptance There is massive turnover with technological devices I like the idea of getting the market hooked on Windows immediately growing and securing market share and then theoretically these consumers will continue to buy MSFT devices or at least Windows packages when they upgrade their personal devices Windows really seems to have the consumer in mind It will work with the Xbox system on mobile phones offering a universal app marketplace direct competition with Google Play Store on Android devices and even with the new age <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>HoloLens MSFT claims to be ushering in the new era of holographic computing into our practical everyday lives I like the universal app idea I think this too could potential help MSFTs market share on the hardware side of things if done well I dont know if Im totally sold on the HoloLens idea yet however I am happy to see their foresight and the wide range of capabilities offered by Windows Other geniuses in the tech space namely Mark Zuckerberg seem to believe that alternate reality will be one of the next revolutionary changes that the digital power of the internet of things will bring to our lives It seems far fetched to me but who knows Im just happy to see MSFT on board with their holographic computing technology if Zuckerberg is right I dont want to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>miss this boat like they did with mobile With all of this said I do worry a bit that the company is focusing a bit too much on the consumer rather than on the commercial side of things which has historically been this companys bread and butter However this new model seems resemble Apples and who can argue with that companys success and near cult status in the eyes of the consumer Nadella and crew arent only being aggressive with the release of their newest OS MSFTs current buyback program is also a positive in my eyes At the end of the companys fiscal year last June it was announced that there was B left of the current B buyback authorization It has also been announced that the company expects to complete with B buyback buy December This equates to sizable shareholder returns and the reduction of share count over the next two years As you can see on the graph below MSFT has reduced its outstanding shares by over the last years Before I mentioned Microsofts AAA credit rating Well the company recently put that reputation to work with a bond offering in February selling almost B in debt The cash raised from this sale will be used for general corporate purposes one of which being buybacks I like the company leveraging debt with rates so low and seemingly ready to rise This B longterm debt sale in comes after a year where the company did sold zero debt It seems as though MSFT management is striking while the iron is hot in terms of low interest rates I think this is sound financial practice and Im happy to see the company willing to take on what seems to be very cost effective risk Conclusion Dont Take My Word For it So lets do a quick recap here We have a B market cap company offering investors a yield with strong dividend growth prospects trading down nearly from its week highs right around support in the range MSFTs ttm PE ratio is x at the current stock price EPS is is expected to slump a bit but estimates are overly bullish with a consensus estimate the expected range is This estimate means that the company is trading at x earnings The stock faces nearterm headwinds in its industry and in a more macro sense with foreign exchange issues That said this company has been a solid performer for decades and remains one of the strongest players in the tech space I believe the stock is trading right around fair value in this area Some believe it will trade lower into the mid s If it does so I will buy the other half of my position at those levels and be a happy camper collecting a yield on cost above But like I said you dont have to take my word for it I think its important to consider all of the other opinions on the matter especially those by the professionals in the analyst industry According to Yahoo Finance the majority of the analysts covering the stock are overly bullish with an average price target of which represents nearly upside from here The low end of the estimate range is and the high end is meaning that downside risk is seemingly low at this point in time This bullish sentiment is shared by the analysts tracked by TipRanks whose average price target is over upside And it isnt just the professionals who are bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>after its Q selloff The bloggers tracked by TipRanks generally have positive opinions on the stock as well with out of coming down on the bullish side of the fence And finally the apparent undervalued nature of MSFT stock is solidified by the fair value calculations made by Morningstar and SP Capital IQ coming in at and respectively Source Dont Over Think It Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Disclosure The author is long SJM MSFT T JNJ
