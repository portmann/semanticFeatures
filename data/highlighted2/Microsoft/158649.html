tag for the upcoming Apple TV hints that it has a more powerful processor and GPU The spies of toMac are saying that the upcoming upgrade to the Apple NASDAQ AAPL TV will come with a higher and price tags The Apple TV will allegedly be unveiled this coming September and it will be launched in October The new iOS powered Apple TV box will also be bigger than the current sub Apple TV It will tout a better CPUGPU and a new remote control The new Apple TV will also support SiriProactive digital assistant and have its own dedicated App Store A software development kit SDK for Apple TV will be made available to developers Apple apparently wants thirdparty developers to create custom apps and games for its new TV box The reason why Apple wants a separate App Store is that unlike iPhones and iPads people will be using the Apple TV box in conjunction with television sets that have various display sizes greater than inches Thirdparty developers will have to create specific iOS apps that will scale properly even on a inch Ultra HD K TV set A separate SDK for the Apple TV platform also allows thirdparty developers to create iOS apps or games that will work with wireless motion controllers TechCrunch reported last week that Apple has a Wiilike game controller for Apple TV Apple was already granted a patent on a Kinectlike motion sensor controller in Techcrunchs rumor is therefore somewhat believable Apple originally created its TV box as a streaming video gadget for the living room It is high time to upgrade it to become a total entertainment package I opine that a motion controllerenabled Apple TV is a serious alternative to more expensive console products like the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Xbox One and Sonys NYSE SNE PlayStation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Sony upgraded their consoles to become more than just gaming devices Its only logical that Apple should also transform the Apple TV box into a fullfledged entertainment system that goes beyond simple video streaming I already envisioned this possibility of a hybrid gamingstreaming Apple TV last April Apple can continue selling the entrylevel Apple TV product to compete with sub Android streaming devices However offering a iOS TV box that lets bigspending iPhoneiPad gamers enjoy motion controllerenabled games on bigscreen TV sets is a great expansion idea Letting thirdparty developers maximize the Metal SDK to create consolequality iOS D games for Apple TV will make even Xbox one addicts take notice The Metal API from Apple has enabled developers to create advanced D games for dualcore Apowered iOS phones Metaloptimized games tout D graphics quality that rivals that of games on the Xbox One and PC desktop platforms Vainglory Plunder Pirates Modern Combat BlackOut and Battle Supremacy are just some of the Metaloptimized iOS games The efficiency of Metal API lowlevel graphics processing is also going to be introduced in the next Mac OS X El Capitan Release This makes me believe that that the Metal API is not only limited to optimizing games on small iOS devices Apple has the patents engineers hardwaresoftware assets and the marketing savvy to sell a potent rival to Xbox One and PlayStation Console gaming is still a billionyear industry According to NPD Groups latest report hardware sales of Xbox One and PlayStation are selling faster than previous generation consoles After months since they were released aggregate sales of Xbox One and PlayStation is almost higher than the sales of Xbox and PlayStation on their first months in the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>even said US sales of its latest console were up for the month of July compared to last years The favorable market for console gaming is a nice opportunity for Apple to really upgrade its connected TV box to include gaming features Future Market Insights FMI still see a CAGR of for connected consoles until the year FMI says gaming is an important component of the connected console concept Newzoo says mobile gaming will overtake console gaming this year However the chart below from Ars Technica reveal an uptrend for console sales Its only smart that Apple also expands its business to connected consoleTV products The weakening demand for iPhones in China means Apple needs a new product to help offset the expected decline in iPhones global sales A motion controllerenabled Apple TV is an obvious expansion product that still has a surging market Sales of PlayStation helped boost Sonys PlayStation division post revenue YoY growth this year Even though Apple generates most of its profit from selling highpriced iPhones selling highermargin connected TV boxes is a notable diversification move Aside from the higher hardware margins from a consoleTV box the additional revenue from appgame purchases adds further importance to Apple TV I already discussed that Apple is the biggest beneficiary in mobile gaming Porting popular billiondollar generating iPhone games to Apple TV is another way to encourage family members to spend more money so they can better enjoy their living room gaming sessions Apples cut from app store purchases was billion last July Adding a new Apple TV device for app purchases could further boost this figure monthly commission If and when
