its guidance for revenue and income Following Apples NASDAQ AAPL spectacular December quarter the refrain of the Apple naysayers became It wont last However the sales momentum of iPhone this quarter seems to be driving Apple revenue and earnings well past Apples January guidance Will Apples earnings report on Monday change the minds of the naysayers Probably not I never bought the argument of the bears that after iPhone that Apple no longer had any way to stimulate sales The novelty of the larger screen iPhones would quickly wear off so it was argued leaving iPhone sales in the doldrums Once again this is the Apple bears viewing Apple as superficially chasing fads rather than innovating at a deep level The idea that the larger screen would have a transitory effect on iPhone Plus sales ignores the fundamental value proposition of iPhone Many consumers recognized the advantages offered by iPhone but just didnt want to squint at a tiny screen iPhone removed reservations about screen size and unleashed a huge wave of demand in the December quarter The value proposition of iPhone didnt change significantly at the beginning of the new year iPhone still offered the best mobile OS ecosystem the fastest smart phone processor and a roomy screen size This is reflected in the current crop of analysts sales estimates for iPhone this quarter Most estimates are in the midfifty million range which is a huge year over year gain and really great performance coming off the December quarter iPhone sales will pretty much dominate the revenue picture this quarter generating roughly of revenue In the table below I summarize my predictions for the March quarter Although Im fairly bullish about iPhone sales Im trying to restrain my optimism for iPad Last quarter I was surprised to the downside If sales exceed my expectations Ill be delighted As for Macs the overall drop in PC sales in the quarter reported by IDC suggests that Mac sales could be a little weak although still outgrowing the PC market My revenue model predicts total revenue of billion which blows well past Apples January guidance of billion I also expect gross margin to improve to based on the high percentage of total revenue generated by iPhone Operating income will also grow by more than yy despite what I expect to be slightly higher than guidance billion operating costs of billion I expect Apple to continue to ramp RD spending aggressively and there may some unexpected additional costs associated with preparations for the Apple Watch launch Speaking of Apple Watch I expect well hear a little about it at the earnings conference call The crystal ball is a little cloudy about whether well get specific numbers Part of the reason we didnt hear anything about the preorders is that Apple typically books sales when customers receive product Apple is working very hard to deliver ahead of schedule and customers appear to be starting to receive their Watch orders as I write Analysts seem to be warming up to Apple Watch FBR Capital now estimates million Watch sales in calendar I still believe this is too low and expect sales in the range of million this year I had estimated that preorders totaled about million in the first weekend so well see what Apple has to say Overall Apples performance this quarter is nothing short of spectacular especially when you compare it to Apples chief rivals in mobile operating systems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft

Google device sales information no cost accounting for Android development Its not even possible to tell exactly how much Google is profiting from Android but its clearly a lot less than Apple Of the three mobile operating systems companies Apple is profiting the most from the mobile device revolution For the investor who wants to profit from the explosion in mobile device usage there simply is no
