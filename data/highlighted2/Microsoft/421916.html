class='textDiv'>Apple Closing The AI Gap Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha The recent developer conferences of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google have featured impressive work in artificial intelligence Apples AI capability appears to lag its competitors The recent developer conferences of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL have highlighted these companies ambitious plans for Artificial Intelligence AI Based on these plans some have concluded that Apple NASDAQ AAPL is falling dangerously behind in AI but we havent yet had the opportunity to see what Apple has been working on Apples upcoming World Wide Developer Conference WWDC will be an opportunity to showcase its own work in AI and it needs to share this work with developers One of the main themes that emerged this year from the developer conferences of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google has been the increasing prominence of AI in their devices and services As I reported in Microsofts Bold Vision of Pervasive Artificial Intelligence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>foresees natural language interaction as the new computer user interface The vision is nothing new but were now much closer to making it a reality Large Web services companies can host AIs within their hyperscale data centers that learn from user actions and are very context aware Most importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offered developers an unprecedented set of tools for building AI into their Windows apps using Microsofthosted Web services Likewise Google unveiled at its IO developer conference a similar vision for Google Assistant Google highlighted its work in AI and its success with AlphaGo in defeating a human Go player Googles intention is to make search more assistive by allowing the AI to learn from user actions and search queries as well as improving voice searches through improved voice recognition The reader may not realize it but the principal application for AI right now is in search Googles search engine is an AI that learns from your search queries in order to anticipate future queries Thats why autofill works as well as it does in Google search The Google Assistant would take that a step further by monitoring your actions through Google connected devices such as Android phones The privacy implications are fairly obvious here but the whole idea is that the Assistant can be more effective by knowing where you are what apps your using and provide context aware suggestions and assistance In the AI visions of both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google mobile devices and AI are natural partners Mobile devices cant be very smart yet but they can serve as useful connections to the data center hosted AI The mobile devices can also provide a wealth of information about what the user is doing always were assured with the users permission Its clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google hope to leverage their AI capability in order to sell their platforms This apparently prompted entrepreneurdeveloper Marco Arment to write a blog piece If Googles right about AI thats a problem for Apple Its an interesting thought provoking piece but Arment may not have employed the best analogy in comparing Apples situation in AI to Blackberrys situation with respect to the disruptive iPhone The analogy provoked one of Daniel Eran Dilgers long diatribes on why Apple isnt like Blackberry Arment writing shortly after Google IO sees a large gap between where Google is and where Apple is in AI He writes If Apple needs strong AI and bigdata services in the next decade to remain competitive they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets inhouse extensively for years And I just dont see that happening Becoming a major bigdata AI services company doesnt happen completely in secret and suddenly get released to the world completed in a keynote Its a massive undertaking spanning many years many people and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world Its easier to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services I believe Arment overstates his case If it were any other company besides Apple I would probably have bought the argument concerning secrecy But this is Apple Furthermore I doubt that Apples AI activities have attracted much attention from the media We all know Apples just a device company right And what the media want to know is what the next iPhone looks like Its media attention that leads to information leaks out of Apple The media havent cared much about what Apple might be doing with its own Siri AI assistant In fact there has been an interesting leak concerning Siri published recently in the The Information and recapped in numerous other publications such as Forbes The gist of the rumor is that Apple is going to provide APIs for developers to access Siri along the lines of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google have announced If such APIs are in development they would likely be rolled out at WWDC Although Arment may overstate the gap between Apple and its competitors in AI there is a gap and its mostly to do with that key AI function of search Apples search capability just isnt as good as its competitors You can see this for yourself by trying the following experiment I asked this same question of both Siri and the Google app on an iPad Siri produced a quote from Wolfram Alpha explaining kinetic energy Close but not quite what I was looking for Google on the other hand produced exactly what I was looking for Okay it was sort of a trick question The fact that Siri didnt know Einsteins formula shows that there is a gap but not a huge one Apple has been investing substantially in search Thats what Apple Maps was all about Maps was much maligned in the media I think partly because of the threat it represented Every year at WWDC Apple has taken its search capability a little further Apples Spotlight is very much a context aware search capability but it doesnt quite rise to the level of Google I expect that at this years WWDC well see further progress in search Arment is right to be concerned about the AI gap but it may already be smaller than anyone outside of Apple realizes He also underestimates Apples ability to close this gap through its RD investments as well as acquisitions Apples RD isnt just about figuring out the right contour for the next iPhone case Apples RD is spread over a number of areas and much of it is pure software However Apple needs to show a bit more of its hand to investors and developers at WWDC Enhancements to search and Siri will be key areas for investors to look for Arment seems to think that Apple is just clueless about AI despite the fact that Apple introduced Siri before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>introduced Cortana I dont think Apple is clueless about AI at all Given the fact that weve seen rollouts of AI APIs for developers from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google thats probably a good indicator of the state of technological maturity in the field Apple will probably introduce similar technology at WWDC Search remains an area requiring additional investment and investors should look for signs of greater search investment at WWDC I believe based on its financial resources increasing RD and existing investments in Siri and search that Apple can and will close whatever AI gap still exists I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a year investment horizon I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking
