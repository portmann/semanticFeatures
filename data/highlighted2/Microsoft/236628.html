total once it began in earnest the banks were closed and you couldnt get your money out more on this in a moment Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Over the past few years when its come to any criticism of business models valuations or other concerns encompassing the social media space along with other dubious hacking inspired businesses emanating from Silicon Valley the immediate rebuttal posed fell along the lines of first being looked as you just dont get it or just crawled out from under some rock followed with Its different this time If one posed any real push back as to move nebulous assertions out from the sky and back into more true ledger accounting Those looks turned into outright disdain and disgust followed with ridicule as the assertions of Its different and You just morphed into closing statements as to implicitly cement the questioning door closed For to go any further it was a waste of their time andor breath After all why try to prove youre right when todays version of the teenage Because Just because works just as handily Over the past few years that defense has worked splendidly Only problem Just like with teenagers there comes a time it no longer works This is where the once goto responses begin to work against not for Welcome to same as it ever was Or one could say Welcome back to reality Where nebulous business plans no longer attract attention nevermind cold hard cash As a matter of fact what has been recently embraced as some entrepreneurial birthright in Silicon Valley ie VC funding at the whim seems to be going the way of Because itself Youre not hearing precise reasoning or explanations for it although the reasons are as clear as day No QE However what you are beginning to now see are the inevitable storm clouds moving from the horizon and making landfall All one needs to do is get their heads outoftheclouds and start reading the writing on the walls right in front of them For the messages they portend are writ large if one wants to see Here are a few that have caught my attention A few weeks ago I was watching a Bloomberg morning show where the guest was one of social medias wellknown aficionados Im not being coy by not naming it really doesnt matter During the discussion there were a few things that struck me One was the on air tension It seemed the more the questioning the more antagonist or dismissive the retorts became Another was in response to a question about Twitter The response Do people even use Twitter any longer For he implied hed already moved from there to another platform Which in many ways validates what Ive stated for years and have been publicly scorned for When the price is free loyalty is as enduring as a Unicorns balance sheet is real Another point to ponder is this Lets put aside anything IPO for a moment and look directly at the VC funding meme Remember for it wasnt all that long ago when those in the VC world were being touted as some form of Superheros to the rescue As a matter of fact one prominent website to this very topic sported a drawing depicting many as just that with capes costumes and more VC money in todays market environment Just months ago VC firms and others would be hosting come one come all stylized events or meetings as to vet the latest group to be showered with some form of initial funding The game as I had written about previously had morphed into more of a numbers game funded via the hot money provided by the Feds ongoing QE policy ie Throw money at all of them for the IPOing of just one will make all sins disappear However that meme is showing signs it to is going the way of its different this time Today you dont need to look deep for its everywhere if you want to see All you need to do is look There are articles sporting titles along the lines of Why you shouldnt seek VC money and more And not from obscure names Some are from the very people who only months ago were depicting as VC superheros Quite a shift and peculiar timing one might infer no So what about everything social After all social media is the be all end all platform in which all dreams are made and cashed out Again after all everyone still instinctively points to Facebook as the continuation of promised milk and honey Just look at their stock price is shouted Another is Just look at mobile theyre killing it You dont understand its different this time Sure it is All Ill point to for a contrasting argument is AOL Facebook currently sports a market cap larger than GE Johnson Johnson Walmart and a host of others These are not trivial companies by any stretch However there is one very distinct difference that should not be lost They sell products and buy ads Facebook primarily sells only ads and all your data but thats for a different discussion In the last bubble AOL also fell into this same paragon of adbased business models It was unique email was the hottest thing Banner ads remember those was the next be all end all to advertising Till it wasnt AOLTime Warner stood with a market cap of some BILLION dollars in It was for all intents and purposes the king of ad sales in the every growing and developing tech based medium Then the bubble burst ie the recession took hold and ad sales literally dried up crushing AOL and anyone else supported purely on an ad model Yet lets not forget about the one thing that takes place right before such a hatchet bears down on ad revenues that many just dont contemplate For AOL did have real ad sales as does Facebook And right before the bottom fell out AOL was also much like Facebook is today being pushed ever higher in valuation That thing is this Right before the axe falls the preceding volume of ad buying becomes more concentrated Any and all peripheral ad money gets bundled and focused into one medium more than the others in what could be classified as a Hail Mary seasonal cycle buy This is how I look at Facebooks latest earnings report The meme of theyre just killing itfiring on all cylinders hearkens to my ears just what happened before the implosion of everything dotcom I am still of the belief the everything social is not its different this time but more of the same as it ever was The latest retail sales report wasnt bad it was horrible Once again missing expectations But theres a much bigger problem More and more retailers are reporting abysmal earnings reports Macy Nordstrom Walmart and others are reporting nothing more than anyone with a shred of common sense knows intuitively as summed up so succinctly by retail maven Howard Davidowitz when speaking on the challenges of retail malls whats going on is the customers dont have the fucking money Thats it This isnt rocket science Current ad spending by retailers as of this writing I believe fits into the same description echoed by Mr Davidowitz Its not rocket science Facebook and a few others are going to be the goto recipients of any and all Hail Mary ad buys for this coming earnings quarter and holiday season Just like with what has taken place with previous assigned Holy Grail inspired ad platforms If retail sales for this shopping season mirror anything close to what this past report portends Again just look to AOL post for hints Ad revenue went from robust to abysmal in the blink of an eye In AOL was still considered the hottest biggest bad ass of everything adinternet generating revenue By its BILLION in ad revenue would be cut in half Then just a year later it would fall even further to nearly cutting itself by another third if not half once again Till finally AOL became Who For comparison Facebook is now just about the same size in market cap as AOL was in The parallels are striking if one dares to look back with any quantitative as well as qualitative analysis eschewing any its different this time reasoning First Isnt it just a little odd or at the least something that makes you go Hmmmmm when none other than one of the most prominent cheerleaders of everything VC andor social Marc Andreessen sells of his Facebook stock in the last two weeks If that doesnt inspire a change in thinking maybe the following will For if theres anything to be gained for insight such as the much touted front page article to mark a bubble How about the very week Facebook hit its peak share price the following was reported with great fanfare To wit President Obama announces launch of his very own Facebook page Oh and one last point just for a little more context Remember I said at the beginning of this article to put aside anything IPO for the moment I was scorned and ridiculed by many especially those within The Valley itself when I penned an article titled Crying Towels Silicon Valleys Next Big Investment Op Yet a funny thing has shown itself on its way to Unicorn paradise The muchanticipated IPO of Square was announced The issue The price is some BILLION less ie at a discount to its latest private funding round for valuation That while simultaneously the other company Mr Dorsey is heading up as CEO Twitter once again falls below its IPO price So now with all that said the only question one needs to ask and answer is this Its different this time Or same as it ever was Sun knukles Sun Keyser I did not fall for the tech bubble though I regretted it on the way up but I did follow the hype I recall that if you found a gorilla company then you should not ask about the pricejust invest because gorilla companies would eat up smaller companies even though gorillas are not carniverous and these were a sure thingdo we still have those Sun LetThemEatRand The greatest thing or the worst thing depending on your point of view about unicorn meat is that it is always taken by anal suppository Its in the hornTM Sun Yen Cross Sun Keyser I find that mixing a little rat meat in with the unicorn meat adds to the flavor amd more closely reflects reality Sun Dragon HAwk Sun nmewn Well Farcebook had a board meeting and announced that upon moar human disasters whatever the fuck that isthats not what I ordereda flat tireI got fired you will now be able to tell everyone
