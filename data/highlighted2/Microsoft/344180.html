Another report claimed that Sony was looking to upgrade the PS with K capability Last Wednesday a widely circulated report attributed to Bloomberg claimed that AMD NASDAQ AMD and Intel NASDAQ INTC were negotiating for licensing of AMDs graphics technology Like most people I accepted the report as likely until I noticed a funny thing While Bloomberg may have issued a report via its terminals there is no followup on Bloombergs site The report appears to have originated with theflycom which provides no link or reference other than the statement that Bloomberg is the source Barrons noticed that there was no actual report on Bloombergs site to back it up The lack of any followup article on Bloombergs site conveys to me that at the very least Bloomberg didnt have a lot of confidence in the report But like all good rumors this one has plausibility going for it Its known that Nvidias NASDAQ NVDA current licensing deal with Intel runs out in Its known that AMD is seeking to license its IP as a way to generate much needed cash The news was warmly received by AMD supporters but is licensing graphics technology to a direct competitor such a good idea It can be argued that since Nvidia doesnt directly compete with Intel in PC processors it had nothing to lose and everything to gain from the licensing deal Intel wasnt going to build into its processors anything close to the graphics capability of Nvidias discrete GPUs Thus Nvidias GPU market remains secure while it receives million in cash from Intel every quarter The situation is different for AMD AMD does directly compete with Intel although not well with steadily eroding market share AMDs CPU designs have been years behind Intel with little to recommend them except their low price About the only positive discriminator that AMD has had has been in the area of combining their Radeon graphics technology with their CPU cores in what AMD chooses to call an Accelerated Processing Unit APU It was semicustom APUs that won AMD its game console business from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Xbox One and Sony NYSE SNE Playstation These are very valuable franchises for AMD Furthermore AMD has been garnering positive reviews for its latest Radeon R Fury X graphics card which scores better than Nvidias best in some early DirectX benchmarks The ability to incorporate superior to Intel graphics capability in its APUs could be the only thing that saves AMDs x processor line of business AMD is still struggling to get its next generation Zen x architecture into production expected by the end of the year but Zen will probably only achieve parity with Intels current Skylake in CPU performance Were AMD to license its graphics technology to Intel it would be giving up for the sake of some quick cash the one last discriminator that AMD has against Intel This only makes sense if you are either so desperate that all you can think about is getting the cash death spiral syndrome or you dont care about the x business anymore AMD is certainly desperate for the cash although I would not have thought that desperate As of AMDs Q financial report AMD still had about million in cash down million from a year ago And AMD gives every indication that it still cares about the x processor business It continues to talk up Zen and obviously it wouldnt invest in Zen if it were bailing out of the business Another rumor that has been making the rounds surfaced on Friday At least this rumor is traceable to a specific source Kataku reported that Sony is working on a Playstation upgrade that will be capable of K video resolution a socalled Playstation This would be good news for AMD since it would mean a new more capable and presumably more expensive APU Since Sony is due to release Playstation VR in the Fall an upgrade to a more capable APU could help Sony in the VR space as well The Kataku article claimed that it learned of the plans from developers at the Game Developers Conference that was held last week Based on conversations with developers who have spoken with Sony this PS will include an upgraded GPU both to support highend K resolution for games and add more processing power that can enhance the games supported by PlayStation VR the headset Sony will launch this fall Every other site that Ive found that carried the story just points back to the Kotaku story That includes The Verge engadget Venture Beat Fortune and Forbes One would think that with so many developers present at GDC who were in on the secret it would have been possible for one of the other sites to independently confirm the report Instead they just reference Kotaku Once again the rumor has plausibility going for it but it kind of runs contrary to what is generally understood about the game console business Generally consoles have very long life cycles Playstation was introduced in in North America and continued to be sold even after the introduction of the PS in late A little over two years into the product cycle seems early for an upgrade The console business has not been able to compensate AMD for the loss of market share in PCs Console APU margins have been declining as prices have decreased At most a processor upgrade resets the margin This still doesnt address AMDs fundamental problem in trying to compete with Intel SA contributor Dividends are Coming wrote in AMD Just A Big Letdown As of late theres been a shift in AMDs marketing as the company is increasingly building up hype on social media to get fans excited about live events that promise to showcase new products and technologies Thats a bold assertion but Dividends does a good job of substantiating it in his analysis of AMDs presentation at GDC as well as product announcements such as Xconnect With the latest reports of an Intel licensing deal and an upgraded PS we also may see signs of the social media push Even if the rumors are true Im convinced that they dont change AMDs financial trajectory AMD simply lacks the resources to compete with Intel in PC processors Whatever shortterm advantage AMD might have gained in graphics relative to Nvidia is likely to be erased when Nvidia releases its nextgeneration graphics architecture which well probably hear a great deal about at Nvidias GPU Technology Conference which starts April I remain long Nvidia rate AMD as a sell I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article
