</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Pundits have discussed the possibility of an Xbox spinoff from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>its a fascinating idea Xbox on its own though is not necessarily a good thing being part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has its obvious advantages in terms of access to financial resources and scale There is a way to enhance Xboxs value as a spinoff entity combine an already successful media business with the console concern Theres been talk in the financial media for some time about whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT should spin off its Xbox asset There are both pros check out this article as well as this piece and cons represented by this article to this argument but I believe management could seriously consider the idea assuming certain conditions are met however The console business is competitive and the industry as a whole has had rough patches the last several years Xbox is a highprofile strong gaming platform but Sony NYSE SNE has done very well with the PlayStation and even though Nintendo faded into the background with the disappointing reception of the WiiU there are still plenty of fans of Mario House and the company is no doubt in a mindset to aggressively promote its next hardware offering Gaming continues to be popular but obviously users have more choices We all know the mobile story the freegamesontheweb story the story concerning digitaldownload services such as Steam and so on all of these tales illustrate the point that the industry continues to go through massive shifts Also the law of diminishing returns is exerting an effect in terms of technological triumph how goodlooking does a game have to be and at what price Is it the processor the algorithms that are the limiting factors involved in the equation of success or is it the design the story Even further complicating the analysis is that game companies really need to be media companies these days The concept of Magnavox Odyssey surviving solely on Pickaxe Pete and Atari thriving only on Haunted House is an antiquated one today there would need to be a Pickaxe Pete movie and a Haunted House television series as well as assorted comic books and action figures to go along with the games to make the model attractive to Wall Street Which brings me back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and its Xbox division <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has built up an impressive brand in this space but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also has other divisions that seem to be a bigger focus Office for one and its transition from boxedproduct to subscriptionservice is an obvious example as is the companys Windows operating system Times as Ive noted are changing and the company cannot rely on Windows and its assorted missteps over the years to grow operations especially as the desktop has yielded its central dominance to tablets and smartphones Acquisitions are key steps in any companys evolution and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>recently made a significant one in the form of LinkedIn LinkedIn though is not necessarily additive to the Xbox franchise And it sort of signals in my opinion anyway that the company has different visions about its future in other words Xbox is obviously still important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but it probably will never overtake something like Officeasaservice as a grand priority worthy of intense focus and ideation Therefore it is perhaps time to seriously vet the notion of doing a spinoff transaction involving Xbox Thing is it cant just be Xbox as a standalone concern thrown out of Redmond with nothing but the design specs of its next console system on its corporate back What would prospective shareholders make of such a beast what would their collective confidence level be concerning a gaming hardwaresoftware company suddenly detached from the most famous not to mention extremely cashrich software company in the world a company in which cyclical weakness could easily be masked by new iterations of productivitysoftware suites Startbutton menus and various acquisitions both grand and humble XboxSpinoff might be more compelling if it had another part to it a media component Lets face facts you can create IP that is composed of cut scenes and action sequences and RPG exploration you can throw in all the quicktime events that you want but todays bottom line demands a synergy between storytelling via software and storytelling on the big screen Before cutting Xbox loose if it ever happens one assumes though that at some point any large business starts to look at its assets to see what parts still make sense to keep and what parts might prosper on their own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should attempt to marry the division to a media company that can create new revenue streams based on Xbox content Not only that but a media company would also be a good investment just for the ROI potential that potential comes with an enormous amount of risk ie some moviesepisodic series are hits some are not and bestofluck with figuring out the why but many tech businesses have found that content could be key to value generation over time eg Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Xboxs eventual destiny might exist in the world of movies merchandise theme parks etc Actually if the company is to survive long into the future I think theres really no might about it Thought experiment what if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had purchased Lions Gate Entertainment NYSE LGF combined it with Xbox and then spun off that entity to shareholders Xbox was always supposed to be a strong competitor in the battle to conquer the consumers entertainment room and gaming was just one side of it all kinds of services can be accessed through the device If Xbox owned Lions Gate that could have been one solution to capturing the attention of those who watch movies in theaters and on streaming services binge the episode season of the latest hot entry in quality cable programming and complete level after level of the latest Resident Evil gorefest Second thought experiment what if Xbox had been paired up with DreamWorks Animation before Comcast saw the light on that value studio What if both Lions Gate and DreamWorks Animation were placed under the same roof as Xbox <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>certainly had the cash it just needed the imagination <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also has always known that content would be important it did at one time have its Xbox Entertainment Studios division Going back to the beginning my thesis rests on the idea that an Xbox spinoff has to be more than just Xbox at that point all you have is another Nintendolike company that has to play the game of producing great firstparty exclusives while praying for robust thirdparty attachment also theres deciding whether to eventually make the exclusive games available on other platforms at some point Im thinking about you again Nintendo Sony has PlayStation and a content studio Nintendo seems to be thinking more about content production publishers like Activision Blizzard NASDAQ ATVI are definitely embracing the contentisking mindset <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would definitely need to buy a media studio before spinning off the business or do some sort of partnershipetctype of transaction that could unlock value for shareholders bonus thought experiment Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA hooks up with Xbox Netflix hooks up with Xbox who knows I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
