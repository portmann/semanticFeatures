Seeking Alpha With the introduction of the Surface Book <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has officially turned the corner MSFT is not just a software company anymore but a company that has taken control of the hardware engineering as well And if you havent noticed thats what Apple has been doing all along <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has really done it this time MSFTs new Surface Book is not only a bold step in the right direction but also its new strategy might prove to be a thunderstorm for the entire PC industry To begin with the Surface Book is really two products in one Its a classic laptop but it can also be turned into a tablet by detaching the screen As for specs the Surface Book has the latest Intel NASDAQ INTC Core i and i processors from the Skylake family an Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA GeForce GPU with GDDR memory two USB ports and an SD card slot <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>claims the Surface Book can run for hours in a single charge something that is suppose to give Apples NASDAQ AAPL MacBook family of laptops a run for their money In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>claims the Surface Book is twice as fast as the MacBook Pro All this does not come cheap with the base model starting at MSFT is also breaking ground with smartphones In a recent New York event the company introduced the Lumia XL the Lumia and the new Lumia No specs were given for the Lumia however the other two phones are impressive Both include quad HD OLED with the processors requiring liquid cooling The carries the Snapdragon bit hexacore processor while the XL the Snapdragon bit octacore processor Both phones come with GB storage expandable to TB with a microSD card slot that was not a typo and both have a megapixel Zeiss PureView rear camera and a megapixel frontfacing camera The cameras also have optical image stabilization and can take pictures in K too On top of that the phones will include support for Windows Hello In a nutshell youll be able to log into the phone with just your face making use of the latest features in Windows Mobile However thats not all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is up to Check out the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Band The Band is first and foremost a fitness device It features many datacollecting health sensors and it includes useful components like a GPS Sure Band also does email calendar text messages phone calls and other useful things but it is made primarily for the health and productivity geek in all of us The scope of this article is not to present to you a review of the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>products and gadgets Instead the scope is to make you realize that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is changing by leaps and bounds and for the most part its coping Apples strategy And that strategy is none other than to take control of both the hardware and software when making stuff Thats right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is turning into a hardware company And it is taking control over the design and engineering of its products Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>correct in doing so Absolutely I have never understood why AAPL could make devices and computers but MSFT could not I have been saying all along that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to take control over the hardware side of things instead of relying on the good faith of OEMs who for the most part do not have an innovative bone in their body In fact the reason why Apple stuff works so well is because AAPL has complete control over the hardware and software engineering Thus it is able to design things so they work great together and so ergonomically that Macs need a lot less processing power to do the same work as many Windows machines Thats also the main reason behind Apples ability to innovate and always be ahead of everyone else It has no constraints when designing stuff With the release of the Surface Book <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>proved that it can innovate if it tries I mean MSFT has so many smart people working for it it is unrealistic to think that it cannot make as good or a better laptop phone or gadget than Dell or Sony NYSE SNE And by taking complete control over the engineering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can design and produce stuff that works well and does not crash as Apple does And I think that laptops phones and gadgets are just the beginning for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I do not see any reason why the company cannot produce desktop computers as well Yes that might put several OEMs in a difficult position but so what Its Microsofts operating system and software engineering it could do whatever it wants with it Microsofts changing business model might should put some pressure on Apple also I mean if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues to innovate with products like the Surface Book then Apple will feel the pressure I do not think that people who use MacBooks or other Apple products will abandon Apple overnight however if MSFT continues churning out great products that work well and have something different to say then over the long term AAPL will feel the pressure Is this positive for Microsofts stock Of course it is Think of it this way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>until now meaning several years ago has been a pure software company The revenue and earnings from this software is not going away It is still there and will continue to be so But hardware sales were never there If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gets serious about the hardware side of things then shareholders will be getting a free bonus Meaning the hardware revenue and the earnings that come with it with no additional effort In fact the only additional thing MSFT has to do is the engineering Manufacturing most of it anyway will always be outsourced Putting Microsofts name on computers and gadgets does not require any additional effort or money As such we now have to look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>from another angle And that angle similar to Apple is a company that designs and manufactures everything from top to bottom inhouse I mean just look at Apple Apple within several years has become the most valuable company in the world May I also add that Apples PC market share is still rising even as PC sales across the board are declining Yes Apple has had many home runs with the iPhone and several other products however it would have never gotten where it has if it was a pure software company I have always disagreed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should only make software I have always insisted that it should make hardware also Who says there are no profits in hardware There are if you make good stuff that people are willing to pay for If you make ordinary middleoftheroad stuff then people will not be willing to pay through the nose for it Further evidence that Microsofts business model is changing is the it is now giving away Windows for free Just like Apple I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should simply charge for great hardware and give the OS for free I like Microsofts recent products and I like the fact that at last it is taking over the engineering behind the hardware and putting its own label on laptops and other stuff I think MSFTs shareholders will benefit greatly over the years ahead the same way Apples shareholders have benefited Of course that assumes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is innovative enough to make things people want to buy But judging from the Surface Book I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will do just fine in this regard We only use your contact details to reply to your
