class='textDiv'>Market Has A Lot Of Negativity Cramers Mad Money Seeking Alpha Oct AM ET Includes ADBE AMGN BIIB CELG DPZ GILD IDTI JACK JCP MCD MSFT MU ORCL PLKI RLYP SIG TIF VTR by SA Editor Mohit Manghnani There is a lot of negativity in the market for anyone to believe about change and turnarounds Cramer keeps talking about a change in McDonalds NYSE MCD but no one believes him I think that CEO Steve Easterbrook knows that if he can somehow get back to the basics of the value meal that tastes good with some chicken and biscuits thrown in he can get that engine to hum said Cramer Dominos Pizza NYSE DPZ and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen NASDAQ PLKI have had successful turnarounds and McDonalds can have one too Had it been only about health Burger King wouldnt have done well He also thinks that Microsofts new Fifth Avenue store could do well but no one thinks that it is cool enough Yet all the corporates use Windows and it is gaining popularity Biotech is also in such a negative trend due to the drug pricing issue But if one sees the PE multiples of stocks like Biogen NASDAQ BIIB Celgene NASDAQ CELG Amgen NASDAQ AMGN and Gilead Sciences NASDAQ GILD they appear cheap compared to their growth prospects Yet some companies with no revenue or drugs for immediate release are trading at hefty valuations One has to wait for the negativity to fade away A similar trend can be seen in defense stocks The world is buying more arms but no one wants to be in Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT Negativity can create terrific bargains every day These stocks are just a short sample of what is out there If you share the Wall Street groupthink youll miss them If you think outside yourself though youll be astonished by what you find said Cramer The bounce in old tech stocks is not restricted to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Companies like Adobe have also found a way to be a popular player in the cloud and the stock is near a high Adobe was up in the last year and is up in the last months The company has started selling software as a service over the cloud and was able to adapt to the new technologies quickly Cramer thinks that Adobe does not get enough credit for transitioning its old software business into the cloud With Adobe hitting a brand new alltime high today I think its worth taking the time to figure out why this stock keeps charging higher confounding the skeptics while also giving you the occasional fabulous entry point courtesy of various shortlived but gigantic pullbacks added Cramer The analysts still remain unimpressed even though Adobe has beaten projections consistently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trades at times earnings and Oracle NYSE ORCL at That way Adobe looks expensive with the PE multiple of but if the companys growth is taken into account it doesnt seem expensive Apple NASDAQ AAPL and its earnings What to do with Apple before it reports earnings There was anxiety in traders and investors of Apple since one of Apples suppliers Dialog Semiconductor OTCDLGNF made flat projections for the year The market immediately connected this news to Apple thinking they have a lot of inventory and the stock plummeted more than for the day All semiconductor stocks took the beating based on a simple assumption that all trade is based on Apple This is called guilt by association Before Apples report investors have gotten out of a stock that is held hostage to Apples actions They trade like an ApplecomponentETF tail is wagging their dog said Cramer Cramer advised to wait and watch rather than taking evasive action The bar has been set high by other tech stocks and Apple could have a shortfall But then the stock is too cheap looking at the PE multiples and growth But as for Apples suppliers I think there is no need to own them The action today is just too vicious to fathom Who needs that level of pain concluded Cramer Signet Jewelers is the company with jewelry store chains such as Kay Jewelers Zales Jared and many more with locations The company reported a good quarter last month and is up from its lows in August Based on Tiffanys NYSE TIF performance one can conclude that jewelry is out of style but Signet tells a different story Last week Signet was added to Wells Fargos priority stock list with an outperform rating The companys success comes from the acquisition of Zales Cramer thinks that this quarter is the beginning of Signet unlocking value from Zales Since Signet reported at the end of August the stock has been absolutely screaming and I cant blame any of the buyers who are crowding into this one because the company has a lot going for it said Cramer Signet has market share in the US which is a very fragmented market where no specialty jewelry store has more than market share The company has the scale to control costs and have consumer studies They are also shareholder friendly as they return of free cash flow via dividends and an upcoming buyback program The entire healthcare sector is under pressure right now and even the stocks that have nothing to do with drug pricing are taking a beating Consider Ventas a healthcare REIT with more than properties across US UK and Canada The company is in realestate and is not a healthcare provider but its shares have fallen in the last months Cramer interviewed CEO Debra Cafaro to find out more Our pipeline is incredible We probably have looked at B in deals this year And our biggest issue is to remain disciplined be a good capital allocator and try to buy earlycycle investments in all of our different segments said Cafaro She also said that the company is looking to to grow EPS at which is more than the companys initial estimate While hospitals may have weak earnings they still pay their rent to Ventas Cafaro notes that there is no shortage of properties to be acquired for Ventas and the company has great assets Cramer likes the stock Jack In The Box NASDAQ JACK Its a wellrun company and Cramer likes it JC Penney NYSE JCP Cramer likes the new management but the retail sector looks gloomy since all stocks are near their lows Relypsa NASDAQ RLYP
