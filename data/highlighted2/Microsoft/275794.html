Grover Tim Cooks Blowup on Minutes was widely covered but the need for tax reform deserves even greater attention Tax reform can help grow the economy by encouraging capital formation and domestic reinvestment while reducing the federal deficit Both Democrats and Republicans recognize need for tax reform one of its leading advocates is new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan Reform is unlikely in a Presidential election year however Companies exploiting loopholes in the tax code to reduce their tax rates may face higher rates in the future Future aftertax earnings and cash flow expectations should be adjusted accordingly Back in September when public outrage was focused on tax inversions I wrote an article entitled Tax Inversions Are Tip Of An Iceberg That Already Cost The US Treasury Hundreds Of Billions While the focus on my article was the B in untaxed foreign earnings of Dow companies an astute commenter pointed out that Apple also was a large offender During his Minutes Interview earlier this month Tim Cook was asked about Apples practice of avoiding US taxes on tens of billions of dollars in overseas income According to an article in The Hill Cook acknowledged that Apple has more money overseas than any other company but said that twothirds of the companys business is abroad He said hed love to bring the overseas money back to the US but that doing so would not be prudent because of the tax rate the company would pay It would cost me percent to bring it home And I dont think thats a reasonable thing to do he said From the earlier article it should be clear that the practice of avoiding taxes on overseas earnings is not limited to Apple In December a major investigative report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ found that Disney and Koch Industries used complex schemes to limit their tax liabilities in the US and Europe by establishing a presence in Luxembourg Ironically with a certain measure of chutzpah Koch Industries was airing ads emphasizing that the company was proudly built on American values and skills and started in the Heartland that year Given that public and private companies across America were exploiting loopholes to limit their tax liability its understandable that Tim Cook felt unfairly singled out by Charlie Roses question However the large scale of the problems with the current tax code also make reform more likely rather than less It unfairly advantages large multinational companies over smaller andor purely domestic ones The Macroeconomic Benefits of Tax Reform The existing tax code discourages repatriation of foreign earnings As a result it incentivizes foreign reinvestment relative to repatriation and domestic reinvestment Clearly this is not in the national interest Removing disincentives to the repatriation of capital can increase domestic reinvestment and help promote economic growth Loopholes that allowed for Googles transfer payment scheme or Koch Industries Swiss branch of a Luxembourg subsidiary deprive the Treasury of muchneeded nearterm revenue while producing an effective tax rate for large multinational corporations that is below that of small businesses and startups Lower topline rates and the elimination of loopholes that are exploited by the countrys largest companies can encourage small business capital formation while reducing the federal deficit and leveling the playing field between large multinational companies and local American startups and small businesses According to a November article in Politico In a speech to the House just before his swearingin Thursday incoming House speaker Paul Ryan named tax reform as one of his top prioritiesThe cynics will scoff theyll say its not possible he said You better believe were going to tryHe spent his nights dreaming about tax policy Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said Thursday in a speech welcoming Ryan to the new post The same article asserts that reform would be less likely in the Presidential election year which pushes any effort into but also points out that Ryan is far more committed to tax reform than John Boehner was Democrats also have warmed to the idea of tax reform In the New Democrat Coalition of rightleaning and moderate Democrats released its tax reform principles According to Bloomberg Businessfriendly House Democrats are urging Congress to overhaul the tax code by lowering corporate rates removing breaks and easing the burden on US companies overseas operations mirroring some Republican goals Even unabashedly liberal Democrats such as MA Senator Elizabeth Warren agree that the current tax code is suboptimal and exhibits the problems enumerated above Her website has an entire section devoted to tax policy which states An army of lobbyists helps create tax loopholes and an army of lawyers helps these companies take advantage of them and its all perfectly legal What does that mean for the rest of us Small businesses are at a competitive disadvantage We need serious tax reform to make the tax code fairer and simpler The most profitable corporations should have to pay their fair share The tax code should not be designed to encourage companies and jobs to go overseas And those who already have made it big have a responsibility to pay a little bit forward so the next kid coming along has a chance to make it too From Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to liberal firebrand Elizabeth Warren it seems there is widespread agreement that the tax code has major problems That bodes well for the prospect of reform in the next administration Republican or Democratic With tax reform looking more like it could be a political reality after the next presidential election it makes sense to consider the impact of lower statutory rates with fewer loopholes on companies bottom lines For illustration below is a table of large consistently profitable multinational tech companies with their effective tax rates over the last five and three years Source Screenerco export from As the table above indicates Apples average effective tax rate over the last three years was actually higher than all of the hightech peers listed in this table In fact Citrixs average tax rate over the last three years was less than half of Apples Apple has accumulated such a large amount of unremitted foreign earnings in large part because its annual earnings are also much higher than this peer group Also notable is the fact that none of these companies are paying anywhere near the statutory topbrakcet US tax rate on corporate earnings In fact Citrix and VMWare have threeyear average tax rates that are actually below the bottom bracket minimum statutory rate of Meanwhile Googles GOOG GOOGL rate is below the bracket that doesnt apply after the first no multiplier of corporate earnings There is room to reduce the topbracket tax rate while still increasing overall tax revenues If tax reform becomes a reality it is likely that the most taxefficient companies will be forced to pay more in taxes regardless as to whether the political solution is revenue neutral to the Treasury Looking at the companies on the list above Citrix VMWare and Google would likely face the largest impact from tax reform but IBM Oracle CA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>with sub effective tax rates might also face a significant impact Apple with its rate actually appears less exposed than many of its hightech peers When forecasting future earnings its important to consider how future tax policy might impact the effective tax rates of companies with unusually low historical rates In addition the onetime impact from repatriation might also need to be considered Lets use Apple as an example Apple reported having billion in deferred tax liabilities related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries in its K filed for the year ended in September relative to billion at the end of the prior year That implies an absolute and highly unlikely worst case scenario in which a onetime repatriation tax on its legacy unremitted foreign earnings of billion was coupled with an increased ongoing cash tax burden of roughly billion a year related to foreign earnings which the company is already booking as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet and was partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets on the cash flow statement However Apple could weather even the worstcase scenario in stride With billion of cash and equivalents billion in shortterm investments and a whopping billion of longterm investments on the same K Apple could satisfy its maximum tax burden without an adverse effect on its balance sheet or liquidity Furthermore billion in additional annual cash taxes sounds like a lot but Apple generated a whopping billion in net income in the most recent fiscal year inclusive of the balance sheet impact of the increase in deferred tax liabilities Given that tax reform would likely reduce topline rates and reduce the burden of repatriating overseas assets that worstcase scenario is likely far too punitive relative to what Apple would actually face under a new tax regime Since the worstcase scenario will not materialize its actually possible that Apples actual ongoing future tax liabilities will accrue at a lower rate than the company is accruing deferred tax liabilities today Its ongoing net income could conceivably benefit even as its cash flow might suffer Hopefully bipartisan tax reform will become a reality in the next presidential administration While my preference is for tax reform that generates incremental revenue to the Treasury and helps to mitigate future deficits in addition to solving the problems above even revenue neutral tax reform would likely raise the effective rates on the companies with the lowest effective tax rates today More fairness and certainty in the tax code would be beneficial for American businesses Rather than railing against critics of current tax policy responsible business leaders like Tim Cook should actively engage in the process and encourage Congress to act on tax
