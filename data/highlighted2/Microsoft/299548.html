own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article iPad quarterly sales suffered yy declines of about in the first three quarters of iPad Pro availability was limited after its November launch which limited its positive impact on quarterly sales The yearoveryear unit sales declines in iPad that began in calendar Q of have continued relentlessly up to calendar Q when unit sales suffered a yy decline For the December quarter the limited availability of iPad Pro probably means no return to growth for the iPad line However Apple NASDAQ AAPL is clearly positioning the Pro and future offshoots as its personal computing platform of the future It would be easy to look at the sales trajectory of the iPad and conclude that Peak iPad occurred in calendar Q Undoubtedly what has happened to iPad sales serves as the model for the assertion of Peak iPhone now being espoused by Apple bears While the bears gloat about the iPad sales decline proApple pundits retreat into denial Daniel Eran Dilgers take on the sales decline is that its due to cannibalization by the iPhone Plus phablet because of course the sales decline couldnt possibly be the result of competitive pressure The problem with this rationalization is that the yy declines in iPad unit sales started in calendar Q of well before the iPhone Plus was released The onset of the iPad sales decline beginning in coincides with the beginning of Intels NASDAQ INTC contra revenue subsidized tablet processor sales in Intel had set for itself the goal of selling at least million tablet processors per quarter By the end of Intel had shipped million tablet processors and lost about billion doing so Intel virtually gave away the million processors which was th of the total tablets shipped globally in according to IDC Yet somehow Apple pundits like to ignore what Intel did and continued to do in pretending that flooding the market with nearly free Intel processors somehow had no impact Contra revenue continued throughout despite Intels assurances that it was being cut back As I pointed out in my recent article on Intels Q earnings Intel appears to have reverted back to full contrarevenue subsidies in order to achieve million tablet processor sales for the quarter For the year tablet processor sales totaled million units Although pressure from artificially lowpriced tablet processors Intel Atom series let up somewhat in the pressure from more capable tablets and in notebooks running Intel Skylake processors increased These were exemplified by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro and the Surface Book These were a much higher class of tablet Whereas Android tablets often feel like mere upscaled smartphones the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface Pro and Surface Book run full versions of Windows And while the Atom tablets often feel underpowered Microsofts devices were powered by fullfledged Coreseries processors The competition offered by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>devices and similar devices by HP NYSE HPQ Dell Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY etc was all the more potent for not being cheap lowend devices So iPad has been taking hits from both the top and the bottom of the tablet market In addition Windows devices have forced an evolution of the tablet market Win has successfully blurred the line between the tablet and notebook and made a good case for being a better value than the iPad The value proposition for the Wintel tablet or in is fairly compelling especially if youre a Windows user A Wintel in equipped with an Intel Core processor can run legacy Windows software serve as a respectable tablet often with a pen accessory and also provide a keyboard and track pad when needed Given that these were priced about the same as iPad Air the value proposition was fairly compelling for anyone who needed to run software such as Adobe Creative Cloud which isnt available for iOS To some extent Apples position on convergence seems pedantic and inflexible Sure Win is a compromise that never really achieves a pure tablet experience The user is constantly forced back into desktop mode so that keyboard and trackpadmouse become necessities But its a compromise that works and you can do things with a Win tablet that you cant do with any Apple device such as use the pen and touchscreen with Adobe Creative Cloud apps Apples position on convergence may have more to do with its longterm product plans than the Steve Jobs dogma that touch screens dont work on the desktop Apple may simply not want to invest the time and money necessary to endow Mac OS X with touch capability Most importantly Apple doesnt want to set up Mac OS X as a competitor to iOS iOS is by far the more lucrative operating system The imperative to not compete with iOS is probably whats driving Apples decision making Its in this context that the iPad Pro is best understood If Apples only goal was to build a touch capable device that would be able to run desktop apps then a touch capable MacBook would have been the right answer Instead Apple has chosen to create the Productivity iPad As such the iPad Pro is only partially successful but where the Pro succeeds it points the way to the future of the iPad and I think tablet computing in general This was brought home to me in Anandtechs very good review of the iPad Pro In addition to the obvious productivity enhancing features such as the larger inch diagonal screen and multitasking provided by iOS the review highlights other important features that point to the future The most important feature is the Apple AX custom system on chip SOC which is a graphicsenhanced version of the processor in the iPhone s Anandtech has performed perhaps the most comprehensive comparison of an Apple SOC with Intels Core M series processors that Ive seen published The bottom line is that Apples latest SOC still trails the CPU performance of the latest Skylake Core M but not by much and it has much better graphics Overall the processors are fairly comparable and this has tremendous ramifications for Apples product plans Almost certainly Apples SOCs are less expensive than Intels even when all expenses such as design and engineering costs are taken into account Ive speculated in the past that this would motivate Apple to port Mac OS X to its ARM SOCs In fact I doubt that Apple wants to manage such a transition mainly because the Mac OS platform is not nearly as lucrative as iOS Instead what Apple wants to do is grow iOS to the point where it supplants Mac OS X for most usage scenarios iPad Pro is an important step in this direction The next most important feature of the iPad Pro is Apple Pencil Stylus capability is of course included in the Surface Pro so Apples adoption of it is not a breakthrough in itself Apple Pencil is an example of Apple taking an existing idea and refining it to the point that it becomes a breakthrough in utility The key improvements here are the extremely high screen resolution the accuracy of positioning of the marks made by the Pencil and the lack of discernible latency The Anandtech reviewer found that using Pencil was very much like using conventional paper and pencil and he liked taking notes on the Pro better than on paper So the pencil turned out to be not just a very useful drawing tool but a legitimate alternative to keyboards for text entry If Apple were to develop a set of handwriting recognition APIs for developers to use Pencil would become that much more useful The advantage of Pencil for text entry is that its much lighter and more compact than a physical keyboard Its also more natural for use when the tablet is held in one hand Apple Pencil is a productivity enhancement that doesnt compromise the fundamental iPad experience and I predict that well see an expansion of its use to other iPads in the near future The next likely candidate is the successor to the iPad Air The final innovation of the iPad Pro is the Smart Keyboard Frankly calling it smart is a complete misnomer Copying the flimsy plastic detachable keyboard of the Surface was the last thing Apple should have done It should just be a rule NO PLASTIC Ever Keyboard yes definitely Plastic keyboard no The keyboard should have had an aluminum frame like the keyboards of the MacBooks and should have been attachable to the iPad Pro in such a way that the combination was rigid and could be used at a variety of screen angles Was Jony Ive on extended leave when they designed the Dumb Keyboard I cant believe he had any design input But once again this was a step in the right direction Detachable keyboards are very useful additions to tablets All told the iPad Pro is not the perfect productivity tool or the tablet that will replace everyones PC It is however much more capable and probably can replace the PC for many users Apple is simply going to keep enhancing the iPad and iOS to make using the PC including Macs less and less necessary The key takeaway for Apple investors is that iPad Pro is a transitional device not a final destination Apple is choosing not to compete directly with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the PCastablet market Instead it has created a device that affords more content creation without sacrificing the basic goodness of iOS With iPad Pro Apple has at the very least made drawing tablets like those from Wacom obsolete Because of the competitive pressures of Intel contrarevenue and Core series ins iPad Pro isnt going to work miracles for iPad sales this quarter iPad sales also were hurt by the lack of an iPad Air refresh which was probably necessitated by the short supply of A processors used in the iPhone ss Plus I expect sales of nonPro iPads to suffer a yy decline of about to approximately million units I expect sales of iPad Pro to be about million units for a total of million This represents a slight yy decline of I really dont expect iPad sales to resume growing until Intel gives up on contra revenue tablet subsidies When that will finally happen is anyones guess As I pointed out Intel seems to be capitulating in the mobile space after realizing that it cant be cost competitive with ARM processors But we wont know for sure until Intels financial data corroborates the curtailing of contra revenue subsidies Apple certainly has the financial wherewithal to weather this storm no matter how long it takes Consequently I view the decline in iPad sales as a transitory effect I remain bullish on Apple and recommend it as a buy Tagged
