(Uncertainty) </span>First, premium units are succumbing to pricing pressure.According to Jay Chou of Worldwide PC Trackers, pricing pressure is bringing premium units down into the mid-level pricing tiers.Secondly, mobile PCs are encroaching on desk-based PCs sales; according to Gartner , mobile PCs, - notebooks, hybrids, Windows tablets - actually grew Y/Y.The problem for Micron is twofold - not only are PC shipments declining, but desk-based PCs are being encroached upon by lighter, cheaper tablets that do not require as much DRAM.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus, Micron may be losing both pricing power and experiencing less DRAM demand overall. (Uncertainty) </span>If Micron is catching a cold from the PC market's chill then Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) must be catching pneumonia.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Where DRAM makes up 61 % of Micron 's total revenue , and PC - related DRAM sales are in the low 30 % range , Intel 's Client Computing group makes up nearly 60 % of its revenue : <b>Microsoft</b> ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) is also heavily dependent upon PC sales . (Microsoft: Uncertainty) </span>However, its Surface Pro 3 - Q1 revenue of $713 million, up 44% Y/Y - acts as a catcher's mitt of sorts ... scooping up consumer demand for notebook computers that used to go to desktops.Intel's "Micron problem" is that while Intel loses chip sales from the decline in PC shipments, prices for desktop PC processors tend to be higher than those for cheaper, mobile PCs.Intel is losing out on volume, price, and most likely margins - thus the loss is amplified.To tamp down its reliance on the PC segment, Intel launched its mobile division.Its adventure into the mobile space was so disastrous that Intel combined its mobile and PC segments in order to mask its mobile losses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said, I still believe its recent acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) was a play to reduce its reliance on its PC segment. (Uncertainty) </span>Until I see results from Intel's acquisition of Altera, I will remain of the opinion that as the PC segment goes, so goes Intel.Micron caught a cold on Friday from a stagnant PC market.You should sell INTC before it catches pneumonia.Disclosure: I am/we are short MU.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
