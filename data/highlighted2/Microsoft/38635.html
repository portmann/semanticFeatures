NASDAQ INTC and follow them and their industries closely All of my research starts with primary sources I use secondary sources as checks I do research daily including channel checks Something interesting happened yesterday April Dell listed a TeraByte SSD GB as an option for many of its highend workstations mobile workstations and desktops I checked the four other largest OEMs in the PC market and none of them offer an SSD storage option higher than GB The five largest OEMs in the PC market accounted for a combined total of of the market roughly twothirds of it Dells GB SSD is not cheap On its Precision M Mobile Workstation it costs more than the lowest cost storage option a GB rpm HDD which is good enough for most casual users But casual users dont buy mobile workstations any way Power users do It is still a lot But wait theres a discount available Now it only costs Is that disruptive To answer that question we have to look at a comparison of storage at sizes more normal for most power users GB is large enough I think as a main storage facility with online and offline backups available at little cost A GB SSD from Dell costs about more than the GB HDD option A GB SSD to make it more applestoapples is more If one or the other is not costdisruptive its sure close As of today no major OEM other than Dell offers a TeraByte SSD for the desktop or in a mobile PC OK thats all nice advertising for Dell but what does it mean to us as investors First I think it is safe to assume that the GB SSD is a product of the IntelMicron joint venture My sources untested reliability tell me that it is planar Dell refused to confirm or deny that but I believe it OK thats the end of the factbased part of this article The rest is almost all my opinion Those of you who do not think much of that can stop reading now So why would Dell offer this option I dont believe that Dell thinks it will sell enough TeraByte SSD drive options in workstations to make it worth offering I believe that Dell is testing the waters Testing the waters for what For the big PC refresh cycle thats scheduled to begin soon Sometime in the near future Intels Skylake will be shipping Skylake is a tock in Intels ticktock process improvement cycle That means it takes an existing architecture and adds features and finetunes it No shrinking is involved Sometime in the near future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT will be shipping Windows Windows is the touch screen enabled next generation Windows operating system Windows contains a new browser codenamed Spartan and integrates Cortana I have the preview on one of my computers and it works fine Nothing earth shattering though so far My sources tell me that Morphcore is not implemented in Skylake Spartan can do some cute tricks like letting you write on a webpage and save or send it to someone So Sometime in the near future Micron will be offering what Intel calls but Micron only reluctantly calls SSDs with costdisruptive pricing Intels GB SerialATA SSD comes closest but is not quite there yet Sometime in the near future OEMs will be offering cameras with realsense technology Computers equipped with realsense technology can use face or fingerprint recognition as a logon instead of a password and recognize gestures Thats a real advantage for a yearold dude I can never remember my password but I always bring my face with me When most of these future events happen I believe we will have another PC refresh cycle At these prices I will want new computers and I believe most power users also will So when is this future event going to happen Well no one can know that yet My sources some pretty good ones tell me Windows and Skylake are scheduled for release in July One source says the third week of July Some of my sources also some other pretty good ones tell me October Whenever it happens what will the it be I believe it will be the release of a huge amount of pentup demand for PCs It was building prior to August and just waiting for the new Windows to emerge We all know what happened to that demand Windows did Ill keep my Windows thank you very much It kept building and waiting for the fix and that turned out to be Windows Here we are now three years later Many bought new computers and downgraded to Windows Many others decided to keep Windows and just wait for an upgrade which made sense So now we have Windows and Skylake and RealSense and Cortana and Spartan and fingerprint or face recognition logon and who knows what other magic tricks Step up to the bar and buy your new fresh off the assembly line super duper PCs laptops twoinones threeinones all with builtin this and that A PC pentup demand release will add a lot to Intel and Microns bottom line Probably Microsofts also but I dont follow it closely Source Micron Intel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>And The Coming PC Refresh Disclosure The author is long
