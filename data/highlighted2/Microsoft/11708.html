About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation MSFT by Hale Stewart Its hard to believe that a company such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT could still be considered a growth story After all a year old company thats dominant in their industry is usually considered mature a corporation whose revenues grow incrementally at best However this description does not apply to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which has had yeartoyear top line growth between since Buyside analysis however do not end here Potential investors should avoid purchasing an issue when solid growth is not supported by a strong balance sheet or solid cash flow Fortunately for potential investors this tech company has a rock solid balance sheet and continuously strong free cash flow One additional factor is the companys current dividend yield of and fiveyear history of increasing dividend growth When these fundamental factors are added together the decision to buy becomes a matter of when and not if And as an analysis of the chart shows the time to buy is now as the security is trading about points above is oneyear low <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>rallied from May until early November when prices started to slowly move lower They consolidated in a triangle pattern from midDecember to midJanuary Prices broke through support at the end of January on a disappointing earnings report Since then they have been consolidating between the lower and mids MSFT is slightly undervalued on a PE pricesales and price to book level This gives us room to move a few points higher which is increased slightly when you consider the company slightly outperforms their industry peers on ROA ROE and net margin Lets turn to the financials starting with the balance sheet Like most tech companies whose primary asset is intellectual property this is a beautiful financial document The current ratio is while the quick ratio is only slightly lower at The company has been keeping a close eye on receivables with the percentage of assets dropping from in to in fiscal They also keep a ton of cash handy they have billion on their balance sheet with most of their holdings in shortterm securities Fundamental investors should like that their overall book value has increased from billion in to in which is almost a doubling in five years The only drawback is their increased use of longterm debt which now totals billion But with an interest coverage ratio of its difficult to be concerned The balance sheet indicates they have ample liquidity and have kept receivables wellmanaged Their neardoubling in book value over a fiveyear period also indicates they have shareholder interests at heart Finally they most likely tapped the debt markets to prevent a high tax bill from repatriation of foreign holdings Their cash flow statement is no less impressive Theyve had free cash flow of between billion and billion over the last five years giving the company ample financial maneuvering room This allows them to selffund most small acquisitions those involving both companies and property if they desire And finally we have their income statement As mentioned in the opening paragraph the company is growing between year They did have a large jump in COGS in their latest annual statement They offered the following explanation in their K Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface devices sold and million higher datacenter expenses primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth Cost of revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS This trend continued in their latest quarterly statement increasing COGS by While this is not an optimal development it is partially caused by their move into cloudbased computing which most analysis myself included believe will provide solid growth avenues for the foreseeable future In addition there are continued costs related to the Nokia acquisition as they noted in their latest Q Cost of revenue increased mainly due to the acquisition of NDS These increases should subside in the next quarters I have to admit that I have made my fair share of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>jokes even referring to them as the evil empire on more than one occasion But all kidding aside its hard not to like the company They have solid revenue growth a very strong balance sheet and the company literally prints money Theyve been increasing their dividend for the last five years and have ample cash and potential revenue growth to continue this practice for the foreseeable future All these factors add up to a solid company Disclosure I do already own the company But this is not an invitation to either buy or sell these securities Do your own research and figure it out for yourself Source <span style='background-color:
