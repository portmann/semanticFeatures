price targets You would think from this weeks news that Apple NASDAQ AAPL should be putting up goingoutofbusiness signs up everywhere Okay that might seem a bit dramatic but thats the sense we are getting from a plethora of analyst notes this week regarding the iPhone In the last few days we are getting iPhone estimate cuts from a number of analysts on the Street pushing shares lower However it seems that many are missing a number of positives in these notes meaning the recent price weakness might provide an opportunity for those who believe in the longterm story It would be extremely repetitive if I detailed every single analyst note weve received so here are just a few snippets from what weve seen lately Morgan Stanley Sees calendar iPhone sales declining by Analyst cuts iPhone unit EPS estimates Reiterates Overweight cuts PT from to Credit Suisse Cuts iPhone and EPS estimates for calendar Maintains Outperform rating and target BofA Merrill Cuts Q iPhone and fullyear estimates Also reduces revenueEPS estimates Neutral rating PT Analysts seem to be a little more worried with calendar Q Apples fiscal Q than they do about the December ending fiscal Q period If you look at the overall estimates the average revenue figure for Q has come down by million in the past few days while the average Q estimate is down by million and the Q EPS consensus has dipped by cents While nobody likes to see declining estimates it does make it easier for the company to beat and perhaps issue guidance not as bad as feared for Q Apples shares recently peaked on December th at falling below earlier this week As a result shares have lost their day moving average and fallen to their lower bollinger band as seen below Perhaps this is just the usual rhetoric with AAPL this time of year Between and the stock underperformed the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF NASDAQ QQQ in four out of five Decembers So far this month Apples shares have lost nearly while the QQQ is basically flat But lets circle back to those analyst notes for a second Despite all of the negatives regarding iPhones analysts have remained quite positive about Apple overall Even with its price target cut Morgan Stanleys target represents more than of upside from Wednesdays close Despite Bank of America having a Neutral rating on the stock the firm sees nearly of upside Analysts see some shortterm pain for the iPhone but a number of them see things getting better over the next couple of years Apples iPhone upgrade program is a key reason as analyst Gene Munster thinks of US iPhone consumers will become annual upgraders by This could result in an annual tailwind of to iPhone units over the next three years or overall Munster also reminded investors that Tim Cook has warned not to rely on the supply chain estimates and detailed the following regarding this weeks warning from Dialog Semiconductor OTCDLGNF If Dialogs guidance was indicative of Mar iPhone units it would suggest units next quarter would be down yy compared to recent analyst iPhone cuts predicting Mar down It appears that sales of the iPhone s and s Plus are not doing as well as most have originally hoped Perhaps that is due to some consumers waiting for a inch phone to be released in It could also be due to continued strong demand from last years models of the phones that are now cheaper than the newest versions A small screen phone to replace the s will likely be at a lower price point which should help Apple target more growth markets around the world Then in late the US upgrade program should start to help reduce the replacement cycle for the iPhone helping boost iPhone sales IDC reported that Apple had just global market share in calendar Q leaving a tremendous amount of room for share growth While I understand how important the smartphone is to Apple investors need to remember that analysts are still looking for revenue and earnings per share growth moving forward Apple has a dividend and a large buyback all while trading at just times fiscal year expected EPS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is expected to report a decline in revenues for its fiscal year and yet everyone is jumping all over that stock closing Wednesday at more than times fiscal year expected EPS It is logical to be concerned about the iPhone weakness but were not talking about AAPL like it is some high growth huge valuation momentum stock The companys best days are still ahead and the stock is perhaps the cheapest in its space It has not been a good week or so for Apples shares with a number of analysts out with bearish reports on the iPhone However the pessimism seems to be contained because many of these analysts continue to have high price targets and buyoutperform ratings on the stock The companys shares are now below the lowest price target on the Street and I dont see analysts telling investors to sell on the news In fact I see a number of them citing things like the annual upgrade program that will help Apple in the long term Perhaps AAPL is in for some shortterm weakness but it seems like the Street is still telling investors to be bullish in the long
