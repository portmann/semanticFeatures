yields averaged per indexArbcom or per Yahoocom as of March Top were INTC and PG tied BA XOM MRK IBM CSCO PFE CAT VZ CVX IndexArb and Yahoo both projected bullish charges for top Dow dogs Analyst yr targets disclosed average upsides from top ten while four averaged a downside Net gains for the top ranged from to from HD MSFT INTC V JPM MRK NKE GS AAPL and PFE Dow stocks by yield showed or more net gain from K invested in the lowestpriced five than from the same investment in all top yielders Yield dividend price results from indexArbcom and Yahoocom for Dow industrial stocks as of market closing prices March led to the actionable conclusions detailed below Investors have utilized Michael B OHiggins dividend dog ranking system to select portfolios of five or ten stocks in the Dow Index to trade as of the last day in December since when he wrote the book Beating The Dow HarperCollins Thereafter dog investors awaited annual results from their investments in the lowest priced highest yielding stocks and trusted that the price of every stock they now owned would climb higher having locked in a high yield percentage at purchase Now named Dogs of the Dow OHiggins system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend paying stocks Incorporating analyst price upside estimates into the dog analysis has expanded the dog stock selection process to include popular growth equities if so desired McGraw Hill Financial publisher of this index states The Dow is a priceweighted measure of US bluechip companies The Dow covers all industries with the exception of transportation and utilities which are covered by the Dow Jones Transportation Average and Dow Jones Utility Average While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules a stock typically is added to The Dow only if the company has an excellent reputation demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors Maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process Dog Metrics Rate Dow Stocks Two Ways by Yield Top ten Dow dogs by yield from IndexArbcom after February included six of nine business sectors basic materials technology healthcare conglomerates consumer goods industrial goods Financials services did not make the top ten and DowJones rates Utilities in a separate index IndexArb describes their dividend estimating strategy thus The Estimated Dividend for each stock below is our best estimate of the per share amount that will be paid during the next year beginning on Mar Most companies pay dividends on a quarterly frequency some pay annually or semiannually The amount timing and growth of each dividend is forecasted from several years of dividend history provided of course that the company has an established track record Otherwise the most recent perceived dividend policy is extended Top ten Dow dogs by yield from YahoocomFinance after February lost one in the consumer goods sector to gain one in technology So unlike IndexArb with six sectors represented Yahoo tallied five of nine two basic materials firms four technology firms one conglomerate two healthcare and one industrial goods firm In the yahoo scheme consumer goods financials services did not make the top ten and Dow has Utilities in its separate index Both IndexArbcom and Yahoocom after February put the top two firms in the same order Chevron Corp NYSE CVX showed the best dividend yield as of market close March A technology firm Verizon NYSE VZ placed second per both ranking schemes Third through tenth place occupants were shuffled in the two lists From third place on IndexArb showed Pfizer Inc NYSE PFE Caterpillar Inc International Business Machines NYSE IBM Cisco Systems Exxon Mobil Corp NYSE XOM Merck NYSE MRK Procter Gamble Boeing NYSE BA For March as in January February one slot changed the balance of the two lists IndexArb put Procter Gamble NYSE PG in the top ten However Yahoo had the technology sector representative Intel Corp NASDAQ INTC in tenth to complete the dual January IndexArbYahoo top ten Dow dividend dog lists Relative strength by yield for the top ten Dow industrial index stocks was graphed below Ten periods of historic projected annual dividend history from invested as k in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and the total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points for each period shown in blue for dividend and green for price Actionable Conclusions Dow Top Dogs Charged Through March per Both IndexArb and Yahoo IndexArb Dow dogs charged with projected annual dividend from k invested falling after February At the same time their single share price soared to make the charge Yahoo also projected a charging scenario as their Dow dog lineup showed a lower annual dividend from k invested as K in each of the top ten while the aggregate single share price for those ten rose between March and March The differences between the IndexArb and the Yahoo chart peaks and valleys over time have been caused by the movement of high price stocks with large dividends in and out of the top ten For example in November the variation circled around a dogfight for ninth and tenth places Variations in share price and annual dividends for General Electric Company at about held price and Coca Cola Co at led to far lower prices on the IndexArb list The Yahoo list however was pumped with WalMart Stores at and McDonalds So the Yahoo price results were higher with dividends lower In January however PG put its higher share price in the tenth slot per IndexArb while lowly INTC occupied the tenth position in the Yahoo scheme to make the price peak for IndexArb Actionable Conclusion Dow Dogs Are Overbought The Dow dogs overbought condition in which aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded projected annual dividend from k invested in each of the ten widened in January on the IndexArb chart while Yahoo Finances graph narrowed the gap The wider gap on the IndexArb graph was due to Procter Gamble higher price and dividend in the mix instead of Intel place on the Yahoo chart The January gap was estimated at or for IndexArb but or per Yahoo Finance At the end of February both graphs widened or on IndexArb but or per Yahoo Finance March moved the IndexArb Dow gap to or while Yahoo had the Dow gap at or Thus the gap between these gaps continued to widen with the IndexArb charts in the lead The result is a lower average cost per dollar of annual dividend on IndexArb of while the Yahoo list average cost per dollar of annual dividend was This gap between high share price and low dividend per k invested shows an overbought condition Meaning no matter which chart you read these are low risk and low opportunity Dow dogs Until the Dow dividend from k invested as k in each of the top ten stocks exceeds the aggregate single share price of those stocks market pressure continuing on the Dow augurs to shrink the gap Actionable Conclusions Wall St Wizards Forecast A Average Upside A Average Net Gain from All Dow Dogs Through March All thirty dogs from the Dow Industrials were graphed below to show relative strengths by dividend and price as of March and those projected by analyst mean price target estimates to the same date in A hypothetical investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased The shares number was then multiplied by projected annual per share dividend amounts to find the dividend return Thereafter the analyst mean target price was used to gauge the stock price upsides and net gains including dividends less broker fees as of Historic prices and actual dividends paid from invested as k in each of the stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those thirty stocks divided by created data points for Projections based on estimated increases in dividend amounts from invested in the thirty Dow stocks and aggregate one year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance divided by created the data points green for price and blue for dividend Analysts reported by Yahoo projected an lower dividend from K invested as k in each dog of this group while aggregate single share price was projected to increase nearly in the coming year With price still projected higher than dividend the analysts predicted Dow dogs extending their overbought condition one year out Personally I think the Dow dogs are still due for a to market correction The number of analysts contributing to the mean target price estimate for each stock was noted in the next to the last column on the chart Three to nine analysts have historically provided the more accurate estimates A beta risk ranking for each analystrated stock was provided in the far right column on the above chart A beta of meant the stocks price would move with the market Less than showed lower than market movement Higher than showed greater than market movement A negative beta number indicated the degree of a stock price movement opposed to the market direction Actionable Conclusion Ten Dow Dividend Dogs Go After to Net Gains As Of March Just two of the top yielding dividend Dow dogs were also verified as top gainers for the coming year by analyst year target prices So this month the dog strategy as graded by wall street analysts was accurate Pfizer Inc was
