Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>today I think is a case study in knowing when you should indeed give up and what you should do after that PCs arent going away any time soon any more than faxes or mainframes did but they are the past not the future Windows is not a point of leverage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in mobile Tech culture is very fond of persistence stubbornness perseverance and the idea that you should never give up Were surrounded by stories of visionaries who were told theyd never succeed and went on to change the world But sometimes you should put selection bias aside and yes give up This applies to big companies perhaps even more than for startups Big companies have entire strategy teams devoted to working out what to do next and how to do it and budgets to hire strategy consulting firms for millions of dollars to produce hundredpage decks with more strategies and ways to achieve them Such people have little interest in saying give up it wont work perhaps because that might mean you dont need a strategy team anymore And theres no SmartArt for failure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT today I think is a case study in knowing when you should indeed give up and what you should do after that As hopefully we all now understand mobile is replacing the PC as the dominant computing platform Smartphones sell in much larger numbers have a much larger user base and are already close to taking a larger share of internet use than the PC in leading markets such as the USA and UK PCs arent going away any time soon any more than faxes or mainframes did but they are the past not the future Since Microsofts mobile operating systems have failed to achieve meaningful market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has hence gone from dominating sales of personal computing devices to powering less than a fifth If you were running <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>what would you do about this The old option from Steve Ballmer was to apply the weight and force of Windows and Office on the PC to force Windows into mobile using sheer effort to come from behind as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had done many times before Leverage Office and Windows against each other Put together late and in stages an operating system that can answer iOS Pay developers to make apps for Windows Phone to seed the market if you have to Put Office onto your own platforms first regardless of where the users are When all else fails and Nokia tell you its giving up buy them out and make the handsets yourself In the past leveraging Windows and Office was the key to Microsofts success but that didnt work this time Windows had actually ceased to be the dominant development platform in the late s with the rise of the web though that mattered less at the time since you still needed to go online and for almost everyone that meant a Windows PC Hence though a big part of Microsofts mobile strategy has been to push towards common code across Windows on the desktop and on mobile so that its easy to write apps for both at the same time in practice thats largely irrelevant The apps that people want on smartphones are not being written for desktop Windows anyway Uber doesnt have a desktop Windows app and neither does Instacart Pinterest or Instagram The apps and services that consumers care about are either smartphoneonly or address the desktop using the web with only partial exceptions for the enterprise You cant tempt developers to support Windows Phone by saying its easy to deploy your desktop app to mobile if there is no desktop app So Windows is not a point of leverage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in mobile Neither was Office Few people really want to edit an Office document on a phone a viewer is normally enough And as Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY also discovered enterprise support is not enough if the broader phone experience is subpar As Apple NASDAQ AAPL has added enterprise features the appeal of Windows Phone has fallen away there too There was a slim chance that Windows Phone might have been able to overcome all this and establish itself in when Nokias NYSE NOK partnership was announced There was no chance at all by the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bought Nokia in and so the writedown of that acquisition now comes as a matter of regret but not surprise Windows Phone has failed to achieve enough scale to be attractive to developers it is a third choice or perhaps even fourth after the greater appeal of just doing another iOS or Android project There are fewer apps and those that are there are later and have fewer features than those on iOS or Android Consumers notice Some people love their Windows Phones but not nearly enough So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has missed mobile Consumer PCs slowly will be a shrinking platform Meanwhile weakness in mobile also bleeds back to the desktop and undermines Office The shift away from the PC will be slower in the enterprise than in consumer internet and so will the rise of alternative software models But as I discussed here the rise of SaaS services and new productivity models on one hand and more and more capable mobile devices on the other means that Office and hence desktop Windows in the enterprise is also probably a declining model This brings us to capitulation A new CEO is acknowledging the end of Windows Everywhere as the driving strategic engine for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and also acknowledging the decline of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office as the monolithic universal experience for productivity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is also suggesting that Xbox is not strategically core either reflecting the reality that it will be the smartphone not the TV or a box plugged into it that will be the hub of the digital experience for most people The smartphone is the sun and everything else orbits it This is a little like Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL transition away from the plaintext web search as the centre of everything and indeed Facebooks tentative shifts away from the Newsfeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has two huge profitable businesses in Windows and Office they will slowly go away so how do you use them to create something new Instead of every new project having in some way to support Office and Windows how do you use Office and Windows to support the future You must distinguish between things that prop up the legacy Office and Windows businesses and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is doing plenty to do that while using them to drive the new things But you also need to work out was that new would look like Googles mission is generalizable beyond web search really as I wrote here its a machine learning company whose mission is to understand everything and help you find it and that doesnt have to mean a text search box For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>its less clear It delivered a PC on every home and on every desk which once seemed like a crazy goal but now mobile means a computer in every pocket and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has little role to play in delivering that so what does it do Again as I suggested here enterprise platforms and productivity are going to change fundamentally and that in turn will enable and feed off a shift away from PCs Sharing document files or copying them as web apps is not the future rather the connective tissue of work needs to be rebuilt By someone I dont have a complete sense of what that looks like but admitting defeat is the first step to working it out
