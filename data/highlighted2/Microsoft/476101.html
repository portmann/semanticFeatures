renewable energy sources Twitter introduces a new ad format and has another management team member leave Target will resume selling Amazon devices Apple NASDAQ AAPL has received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to sell energy No the tech company wont be firing up its rigs or coalmining operations To no surprise it will be doing so with clean energy Those who follow Apple know the company has already made plans for building out a massive solar farm in the past with the goal of being selfsustainable Its solar farm plans cover an enormous amount of ground some acres kicking out megawatts of power The price tag aint cheap unless youre Apple with expectations for it to cost million At the time CEO Tim Cook referred to the project as the biggest boldest and most ambitious project ever Heres why the solar deal matters The companys solar farm will be large enough to power all of the companys stores in California as well its offices headquarters and data centers To put it in perspective its enough electricity to power some homes in the state Excess electricity can then be sold Aside from the upfront costs theres not much to hate on here The company already powers its other data centers with renewable energy as well So really its just Apples way of increasing its renewables footprint and decreasing its carbon footprint If the company where financially struggling it would be one thing But given Apples enormous cash pile billion in cash and shortterm investments as of last quarter I think the company can more than handle it Twitters NYSE TWTR shares are continuing their move from Wednesday when the stock saw a gain after rumors surfaced that former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT CEO Steve Ballmer and Saudi Prince AlWaleed Bin Talal will take the company private Although the stock rose Thursday as well up the company has got more news around it but not in regards to MA Earlier this week we reported that Natalie Kerris the companys head of communications would be stepping down from her post after just six months on the job As a result the chief marketing officer would assume her role Now we find that Jim Prosser head of corporate revenue and policy communications is also leaving Clearly its not a fun department to be in at Twitter All kidding aside it does leave open the concern that the company is struggling to get on or stay on track as it has such a high turnover rate in its top offices Perhaps adding to the takeover speculation Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO chief of communication leaves after takeover by Verizon NYSE VZ Separately the company also introduced ads with incentives The advertisements allow advertisers to essentially entice users to reply to or retweet ads in order to unlock content Some have their doubts but it seems like this could be a unique way to drive ad engagement higher While it certainly doesnt solve the companys MAU growth issue it is improving one large aspect of the business Now if only Twitter could get user growth going something the company is hoping for with its string of streaming deals it has lined up the business would be far more attractive to buyers Target NYSE TGT and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN are apparently friends again Well sort of Its not really like that time that Costco NASDAQ COST starting selling Apple products again because the two werent competitors like Target and Amazon are In any regard Target will now resume selling Kindle readers Fire tablets and Fire TV all of which are made by Amazon For now the company is only selling the devices online but later this year Target plans to sell them in its stores as well If youre trying to remember when the company stopped selling devices I wasnt sure either Turns out though it was back in At the time analysts hailed the ban as a savvy move to rid its stores of a Trojan horse according to Bloomberg However the writer goes on to say that because Amazon has already dominated so much of the US in terms of driving Prime signups theres less risk today than four years ago that a Kindle device sold in Target will convert someone into a loyal Amazon shopper Target is looking to boost sales for its electronics division while Amazon wants to boost sales of the devices to increase uptake for digital book sales Fine But it still seems to me that Amazon is the winner in this one Target will see a slight boost overall but for each sale that it completes Amazon is getting one step closer and making that much more of a connection with a customer Maybe they are or arent a Prime member lets forget about that for a minute It starts with a Kindle then the customer buys a few books Then instead of Googling for a product maybe they turn to Amazon here and there Then a lot Im not saying Target is stupid for selling Kindles or that it will doom its longterm business It just feels like it benefits Amazon more over the long term Facebook Says Goodbye to Clickbait and Sheryl Sandberg There has been mild speculation that Facebook NASDAQ FB COO Sheryl Sandberg could be headed to the Capitol as Treasury secretary should Hillary Clinton win the election this fall Sandberg has been a tremendous leader at Facebook and surely investors would be disappointed to hear of her departure Not that its a forsure outcome or anything but it is a concept making the rounds and one that seemed worthy of mentioning for the billion company Another far more exciting concept making the rounds is Facebooks latest steps to combat clickbait The social media juggernaut has built an algorithm first by manually sorting through thousands of stories that ranks headlines based on a clickbait score Too much of a clickbaitlike headline and the story doesnt appear in users timelines any more Just so were clear we all know those annoying pesky and ultimately disappointing headlines that look something like this compliments of Eric McCaffrey whose news alert is linked in the above paragraph Facebook gives the following examples of stories it is aiming to diminish When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw THIS I Was SHOCKED and The Dog Barked At The Deliveryman And His Reaction Was Priceless The other day I was talking with someone about Facebook and its ad placements The conversation drifted toward how the company wisely puts such an important emphasis on its users rather than cramming ads down their throats in the name of shortterm profits Thats not to say Facebook doesnt do enough ads But for example look at Instagram and WhatsApp As soon as it acquired these properties Facebook could have kicked on the ad spigot It might have made investors happy in the short term but it surely would have spelled trouble in the long term Simply put by thinking about its users Facebook is also taking care of its investors whether they realize it or not Aside from carefully taking aim with its ads on each platform it also takes a calculated and delayed approach This gives Facebook levers to pull in the future equating to consistently impressive growth rather than flybynight type of growth So how does the clickbait ban fit in Simply put it shows that the company continues to be a leader in its field and that it continues to do its best to improve the user experience No users no profits and Facebook will do everything it can not to ruin the first part of that
