class='textDiv'>Microsofts Bold Vision Of Pervasive Artificial Intelligence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts keynote for its Build developer conference contained a new vision for personal computing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>foresees natural language conversations becoming the primary user interface At the Build conferenc e which kicked off on March developers got a sneak peak at Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT vision of all pervasive artificial intelligence AI CEO Satya Nadella calls this conversations as a platform in which human language is the preferred user interface If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>achieves its vision it will be a breakthrough that will change the way we interact with our computing devices One of the staples of science fiction has been artificial intelligence smart enough to have a natural conversation with Such an advanced capability has been elusive but in recent years cloud based speech recognition services from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL have gotten closer to the fictional dream Critical to the workings of these systems is that they connect to large cloud based AI systems that can to a greater or lesser extent discern context information in order to provide an intelligent and useful response Such systems are far from perfect and quite often produce artificial stupidity Thus Microsofts goal of making speech recognition combined with various AI based services the underpinning of a new computing user interface might seem overly ambitious Thus far Google Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have restricted their AI digital assistants to relatively modest tasks basic speech recognition a front end for search and some general purpose commands Despite their limitations the personal digital assistants such as Googles mobile app and the Cortana and Siri digital assistants represent an exciting frontier in application development These are apps that provide connectivity to specialized cloud based AIs While the apps perform critical user interface functionality the real computing horsepower resides in a server farm that could be hundreds of miles away from the user These digital assistant apps have been first party apps developed by the companies that develop the operating systems the apps run on For the most part the cloud services that back the speech recognition capability of the apps havent been available for third party developers This is the critical thing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to change It may be that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is better positioned to make this change than either Google or Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>already has a very well developed cloud services infrastructure What this means fundamentally is that developers can create programs that run on Microsofts cloud servers These programs can be either Web apps accessible via a standard browser or they can be accessed by mobile apps While all three companies utilize cloud based apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>probably has the best set of tools for developers to create their own cloud apps In contrast Apple offers developers almost no capability in this regard even though Apple offers consumers an extensive suite of cloud based services Google Cloud Platform offers services comparable to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>though perhaps not as mature What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is doing to make language recognition into a pervasive computing interface is offering developers the features and capabilities of Cortana to use in their own applications <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>calls this the Cortana Intelligence Suite In effect developers will be able to build into their apps mini Cortanas generically referred to as bots These bots are hosted in the cloud and can be endowed with a tailored set of capabilities to suit the needs of the app Bot capabilities are not restricted to speech recognition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>plans to make available a broad array of what it calls cognitive APIs that provide various artificial intelligence functions beyond speech recognition These include image analysis knowledge and learning and search In contrast with what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is offering the capabilities currently resident in Android and iOS are much more limited Android has some speech recognition and search APIs that developers can use but nothing close to Microsofts cognitive APIs Apple offers even less for iOS no speech recognition APIs and only a very limited Spotlight Search capability What we were shown at Build was all very carefully labeled as preliminary Still there were no embarrassing moments where things didnt work at all The scope of the demos was limited however I dont think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>means to replace the Win UI any time soon but it does want to give developers the chance to explore and work with the new APIs As developers get experience and the tools themselves mature I expect that well see more widespread use of bots and language recognition And widespread means not confined to Windows devices Since the APIs are fundamentally cloud computing based <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is making them available for use with either Android or iOS As I pointed out in my recent article on Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Echo speech recognition device for the home were seeing a very powerful confluence of a mobile or at least compact device that provides the hardwaresoftware front end and cloud computing based AI on the back end These cloud based AIs are more than just speech recognition engines They are capable of learning from the behavior of the user in order to anticipate the users needs and wishes They have broad contextual awareness that makes their speech recognition more effective The companies that are out in front in this area are the companies with the best developed set of tools for cloud based apps Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Google as a cloud services company is not far behind although their tools for developers may not be as mature Apple when it comes to developer tools for the cloud is just woefully inadequate For some time weve been hearing Nadella talk about the mobile first cloud first world It always seemed a little vague and tenuous to me How this was supposed to translate into a business advantage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wasnt clear With the Cortana Intelligence Suite the linkage between mobile and cloud is now well defined There may be stumbles along the way Unleashing developers to create their own bots is fraught with a certain peril Nevertheless its a vision of the future which is very compelling and almost certainly the right direction At times especially over the course of Win development <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has seemed to meander directionless Thats no longer the case If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can execute on this strategy it could translate into a profound impact on personal computing as well as a profound competitive advantage Are Google and Apple as far behind as they appear Perhaps not Both have developer conferences of their own coming up in the next few months We may see movement in a similar direction by both companies I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
