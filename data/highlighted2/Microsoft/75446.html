<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>seems to have a plan B for mobile This plan is necessary because Windows Phone is failing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>buys email app Acompli reportedly for M Do you see whats happening here Ill tell you whats happening <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is preparing to pull a fast one on Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL This is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>readying its Plan B for when Windows Phone fails And as it is Windows Phone is failing already its been losing market share since early and now stands at just of the market which is basically nothing Plan B seems to be about taking over Android from Google That is the fast one I am talking about here Android is seen as open source and indeed it is open source in the sense that theres an Android Open Source Project AOSP and anyone can use this version of Android for free in their smartphones However there is an exception to this which is both proprietary not open and paid not free I am talking about the Google Apps as well as the licensing to use the Android brand Google Apps have turned into a significant part of the Android experience and indeed at times are necessary to provide compatibility to other apps which require their presence to work These apps include These apps make the foundation of the Android experience Many people couldnt even conceive of Android without them But as it turns out theyre not a central part of the free Android OS though they can be necessary to use it to its fullest This is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might be trying to come in Its quickly building its own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apps alternative And indeed there are already clues that it plans to deploy it that way as seen in an agreement with Cyanogen Furthermore in a way the market is still wide open for this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>strategy This is so because the Chinese market which represented of the worldwide smartphone market in still doesnt receive Google apps That is this large market is served by Android but not by Google Instead theres a plethora of different app stores included apps etc Thus the Chinese market can serve as a beachhead for anyone trying to establish a credible set of alternative apps And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>seems to be trying exactly for that angle The one problem this strategy faces is that there are many apps which rely on using Google API calls which are proprietary to Google Thus those apps can have a problem working with any alternative That said if any alternative captures enough market share its certain that those apps will be rewritten to work with both large constituencies There are a few predictions which can be drawn from this thesis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will officially bundle these apps instead of just presenting them separately And it will try to have more companies install them in their smartphones at inception However there is a backlash against bloatware in the West and having duplicates for every app is unfriendly As such Id expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to first make a large push for a ChinaIndia installed base with its strategy Bing Maps will be a thing APP Presently its included within the Bing app Nearly every Google app will see a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>equivalent Email to do calendar search launcher with integrated search Google Now etc This is nearly complete Lumia Camera presently on Windows Phone will see an Android version There will also be a gallery app together with Lumia Camera The one thing which remains to be seen is whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will forego licensing fees at this point In China and India licensing fees would be a barrier to entry And even elsewhere theyd be a problem before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a large market share The priority for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at this point is to regain a beachhead in mobile where it failed miserably Windows Phone has failed and Windows is unlikely to revive it I believe that the recent urge by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to set up a credible suite of mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apps is Microsofts plan B This plan includes pulling a fast one on Google by taking advantage of the open source nature of Android to provide a credible alternative to Google apps This might be a risk for Google over time If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>manages to take significant share from Google on Android over time this will allow it to also reinforce its Bing franchise among others As for Google smartphones where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>takes share will be smartphones less prone to do Google searches It remains to be seen how Google will handle this if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gets traction for this strategy The answer might lead to a larger component of Android becoming proprietary over time
