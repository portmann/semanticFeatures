class='textDiv'>Apples Secrecy A Major Problem Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apples shares are falling as there is no room to grow in the smartphone business a sector Apple completely dominates In the hardware business no new revenue leader is in sight As part of my ongoing under the hood coverage I take a view at Apples data business where I see much potential left untapped Welcome to the Apple NASDAQ AAPL edition of my under the hood series part I Googles AI breakthroughs part II IBM Watson This one is a little different than the others because Apple is massively lagging behind in capitalizing on AI Artificial Intelligence and analytics Further Apple is so secretive about everything it does that we have to look at results instead of explanations In this article I make some fundamental observations about how Apples management deals with a new world of datadriven applications Apple is a consumer electronics company period This is in stark contrast to being a data company Tim Cook and other Apple management have repeatedly commented on this The gist of Apples stance on data and cloud services is that Apple does not care about your data and unlike Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or Facebook NASDAQ FB does not monetize it I am not challenging that assumption Apple does not need to monetize its user data What I am challenging is how little Apple cares about the business opportunities around data infrastructure AI and cloud services The prevailing wisdom on Apple is that it needs to diversify away from the iPhone as sales are expected to fall going forward into Q Another contributor recently broke down revenue categories The key argument from that article is that Apple will be able to increase revenue from services such as Apple Pay Apple Music or iCloud storage and productivity applications significantly over the next few years These are all consumer services and they do not help with building applications A few years ago competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT began a transformation from a PCsoftware company to a cloud services company This made sense because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>relied on thirdparty vendors selling enough commodity PCs with Windows and Office to generate oneoff revenue from software licenses With the shrinking PC market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was driven towards changing itself into a service business Then again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was never a device company the way Apple was Microsofts cloud business is thriving after this successful transformation Meanwhile Apples strategy is still the same one that has worked for it these past decades create incredibly welldesigned devices that integrate into the Apple ecosystem and sell them at fantastic premiums Apple makes almost all of the profit in the phone market As iPhone sales make up about of total revenue with iPads and Macs both new revenue leaders are what Wall Street wants and Apple needs Since Tim Cook and arguably Jony Ive took over the recipe of identifying new device categories has primarily brought us the Apple watch It might bring us a car although that does not seem so sure any more More recently rumor has it Apple might be looking at virtual reality VR The question is whether this recipe will really continue to work for Apple long term Here is why I think it will not The th century was arguably the century of the PC and with it an explosion of other microchipdriven devices Apple has been right in the center of this explosion and especially in the first decade of this century has transformed mobile devices as an electronics category It is temping to think that Apple can just go on to produce more devices in new categories and dominate them as well Humans are really really bad at anticipating how much things can change Here is how I think things are about to change The world is changing from a devicedriven world to a datadriven world Take a moment to reflect on how much devices have changed between the s and now Now run your imagination on how much they will change in the upcoming decades My prediction is that devices will become less important than interaction services and algorithms We are already seeing the first steps of this in the massive surge of SoftwareasaService businesses disintermediating traditional business models This has become possible ever since computing power and data analysis services have become commoditized through cloud infrastructure providers such Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Web Services So far Apple has done little to capitalize on this shift The iCloud has almost million users now but those are retailcentered storage and message services Apple hosts apps and provides development environments and programming languages for them although Objective C is an abomination Apple does not provide infrastructure as a service or any cloud services that would allow developers to easily integrate natural language processing image recognition or predictive analytics into their applications the way IBM NYSE IBM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Amazon or Alphabet do This means that in a world where applications become more datadriven developers have to leave the Apple ecosystem for thirdparty providers An overview of machine learningrelated resources for iOS can be found here So what is Apple thinking about all this I said this would be an article of my under the hood series but Apple is annoyingly secretive about everything it does When Apple researchers attend conferences they take everything in but dont give anything away while Alphabet and Facebook are publishing papers almost weekly and releasing various open source tools Their efforts and funding are fueling an explosion in the development of more intelligent services These companies have become natural destinations for AI and software talent while Apple is a destination for design and hardware engineering talent Apples flagship machine learning product Siri was an acquisition The Siri backend was originally built by Nuance NASDAQ NUAN a leading speech processing company I could describe how Siri roughly works but it is very similar to Watson in many ways However there is no key publication I could refer to Even though the Siri founders themselves were known figures in the AI scene eg Adam Cheyer they have left Apple since Whatever was known about their preApple work is probably not very indicative of todays Siri Siris components are speech recognition sentence parsing intent analysis and centrally connection to lots of thirdparty web services like OpenTable WolframAlpha or Bing to collect whatever data is relevant to the query Finally texttospeech translates the output into Siris voice the mechanism of which is described here although not in a very technical manner The devil is of course in the details and unlike IBM Google or Facebook Apple has no interest in letting us now what is under the hood This is a shame because Apple could with some effort provide individual modules of Siri as web services that could be integrated into iOS apps This would be a great alternative to Watson that would allow Apple to break into the cloud analytics segment Now Apple is of course not just sitting on its hands Instead it is quietly acquiring small AI startups here and there Also it is reported to actively hire in its machine learning division Indeed there are quite a few jobs like this offered on LinkedIn NYSE LNKD The problem is that this is not enough What Apple in my opinion is lacking is someone driving its vision in this area Just acquiring a few startups here and there cannot replace someone with a longterm vision of the future that reaches beyond the next few devices Facebook understands this and has hired leading machine learning figures to run its AI research lab in New York Alphabet is strongly driven by Larry Pages moonshot vision towards a general artificial intelligence that is permeating all of its services Even Twitter NYSE TWTR has acquired leading expertise through the spinoff of Harvard machine learning star Ryan Adams See the reason these other companies are so attractive for leading figures in the field is because they a have lots of interesting data b lots of money and c encourage publications Apple has money but as soon as you enter its gates you have to stop publishing your work which researchers dislike The takeaway from all of this is that I think Apples secrecy is hurting itself With regard to its devices secrecy is part of the Apple marketing myth and this has worked incredibly well In contrast I see no reason why Apple is not more open about its efforts with projects like Siri The difference between Apples past and Apples future is that devices like an iPad or a Macbook on which I am writing this article could stand on their own due to superior hardware design and user interfaces Future projects like a car will need to rely on data services algorithms and learning capabilities to a much larger degree As of right now Apple is not fostering the right environment to ensure that such projects will be successful I think Apple needs to rethink its strategy around data services AI and the cloud The company may very well continue to dominate mobile device markets even without doing so However if management does not take action soon applications will increasingly shift towards using the data and analytics services of Apples competitors If algorithms eat the world devices will become marginalized compared to the intelligent services running on them Tim Cook needs to make a key hire to lead Apple into the datadriven future and ensure the companys ecosystem continues to thrive This article is part of my ongoing Under the hood series in the technology space If there is anything in the softwaremachine learninganalytics space you would like me to cover please comment or send me a message Future installments of this will include Amazon Web Services Facebook and Baidu Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from
