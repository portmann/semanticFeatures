older models at discounts with the proper iPhone starting at to starting the iPhone range at and scaling up on screen size and price iPad After software changes and accessories the remaining piece is the difficulty in making money selling productivity apps partly because of the free or nearfree products from industry giants Reactions to Apple NASDAQ AAPL events are generally either thats crazy or thats boring and reactions to this weeks event were definitely on the boring side Theres certainly a bit of housekeeping new Apple Watch bands say but actually I think there are two things that are pretty important New iPhones used to start at with twoyearold ones discounted at Benedict Evans BenedictEvans March People have been talking about cheaper iPhones for as long as theres been an iPhone Starting with the iPhone G Apple successfully harnessed itself to the operators handset subsidy model and it then passed through the shift from embedded subsidies to unbundled hirepurchase deals without a hitch But each years new iPhone still starts at over before that subsidy and that still works its way through to the consumer in the form of higher monthly charges or upfront payments and of course prepay with no subsidy is a large market in western Europe and increasingly the US and the only significant model outside developed markets So far Apple has addressed this by selling models from the previous two years at discounts of and taking the entry price before subsidy down to or so In addition the secondhand market for iPhones is strong seemingly rather stronger than that for Androids of similar price giving another way to increase the size of Apples ecosystem though of course providing no direct revenue And Apples move to offer its own frequentupgrade plans gives another way to broaden the base Public data for this has been scanty but Apples ASP stayed high enough that it was pretty clear it wasnt selling many of the old models and this week Apple confirmed this saying that it sold m fourinch iPhones that is the and s in out of m total iPhone units The last time Apple looked at addressing this directly the result was the iPhone C Installbase data seems to show that this sold about as well as previous last years model phones at that price point but no better it didnt really change the story and Apple didnt continue the strategy It went back to just selling discounted older models again Now we come to the iPhone SE This is a very different strategy The iPhone C was clearly a different cheaper product It looked different coming in colors but having a bulkier case to no other user benefit and had a lower spec It was very obviously a cheaper iPhone In contrast the iPhone SE is effectively a smaller iPhone S at a lower price It has almost all of the same components and specs and even a better camera than the discountedto iPhone It uses a premium design albeit from an older model The only meaningful difference from the flagship is that it has a smaller screen and costs less So Id suggest that the iPhone SE is not the cheap one any more than the iPhone S is the cheap one compared to the iPhone S Plus Its the smaller one but its still a topoftheline phone Hence as the tweet at the beginning says what Apple has really done is moved from selling older models at discounts with the proper iPhone starting at to starting the iPhone range at and scaling up on screen size and price There are a bunch of interesting secondorder implications for this By launching six months after the actual iPhone S Apple smooths out the supply chain and reduces cannibalization from people who really want the newest one and probably gets better component prices But its still selling premium components instead of twoyearold components at instead of so Id expect a long discussion of margin implications at the next quarterly call And this also points to how misguided it is to poke around in earnings releases from Apples supply chain to work out iPhone sales One also can wonder what happens in the next product cycle presumably the iPhone disappears the S goes to and the SE is refreshed perhaps without a new name Or does it go to Certainly it will be on the secondhand market at But the key thing is that after eight years the iPhone range really now starts at not or more With the and Plus Apple addressed screensize as a reason to buy premium Android and their results are clear in Samsungs OTCSSNLF financials Now its going after price and the midrange is still nowhere near the or so that decent Android phones start at let alone the entry price of or less for one with very low specs but this is still going to shake things up Apple has sold over m iPads It has share of tablet traffic web share and tablets are a doubledigit share of web use The users love them But sales are slowly declining To me there are two linked issues here First tablets are essentially filling a PC use case a large screen device thats not in your pocket all the time but that can do more and that market is in decline as smartphones take over more and more of that use Tablets are selling into a declining market as smartphones increasingly dominate And second the replacement rate for tablets just as for PCs is slow PCs are around five years and tablets may be close to the same its still too early to say A three or fouryearold iPad is just fine especially if you dont carry it around with you Apple has clearly had a v rethink around this to try to drive greater switching from PCs and Macs both within that upgrade cycle and perhaps accelerating it It has added the pencil and the keyboard both pretty much the right instance of each added splitscreen multitasking and pushed into productivity both with OS features and the partnership with IBM NYSE IBM while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has helpfully also put Office mostly some elements such of charts are works in progress onto the platform Its trying to address the things that keep people on Windows or Mac generally that one app or use case Having started with the new larger iPad Pro last year its now rolled this strategy out to the inch format Its not clear what happens to the Mini this is now somewhat marooned between the inch format and the iPhone Plus and Apple may just keep it on as a convenient cheap entry point rather like the iPod Touch Arguably after the software changes and accessories the remaining piece is the difficulty in making money selling iPad productivity apps partly because of the free or nearfree products from the industry giants On this I suspect the App Store is the subject of a broader conversation inside Apple All of this sits within a broader generational shift in productivity though The iPad has great productivity stories for example Paper Office Box Dropbox Slack Quip OnShape IBM or Adobe NASDAQ ADBE But the real shift is around a move away from typing and filing and towards SaaS cloud AI and unbundling of Office itself That is you dont compete with PowerPoint or Excel by making better software for slides or spreadsheets You compete by moving away from slides and spreadsheets For more discussion of this see here Tagged Technology Personal Computers Expert Insight </div></body></html>
