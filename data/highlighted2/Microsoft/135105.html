NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha As users turn increasingly to mobile Windows and Office seem less relevant As users turn increasingly to Android Windows and iOS seem less relevant Windows seems to have better staying power than iOS SA Author Benedict Evans wrote a terrific article setting out the need for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to capitulate in order to clear the decks to rebuild itself in an increasingly mobile world but failing to suggest just how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might do that Evans points out quite accurately that consumers dont really want or need Windows or Office any more are increasingly turning to mobile for their wants and needs and while the desktop or laptop may have a future that future is like the fax machine on the wane His most telling point is the decline in the percentage of devices that today use a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>OS something like His very effective and compelling chart is reproduced below Evans article speaks to an issue that confronts not only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but also Apple NASDAQ AAPL the risk of irrelevance as share of devices falls The one platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is beating is the combined iOS and OS X usage of Apple Todays article by Emma Haslett in Tech News sums it up analysts think Windows will continue to outsell Apples platforms although Android seems destined to win Despite analysts enthusiasm for the markets strong acceptance of the iPhone models Apple Q results were a disappointment to many who had visions of growth in China propelling Apple to a recovery of market share it had lost in recent years Apple did have very strong sales in the robust China market but nonetheless saw its market share drop to well behind industry leader Xiaomi who surged to and eclipsed by a resurgent Huawei who now holds of the China market Apple faces a different problem than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and that problem is Samsung Apple has tried to position itself as an aspirational brand to command high prices and high margins with considerable success But the venerable iPhone continues to lag premium Android phones in quality reliability and processing power at least in my opinion The Samsung S for example has enjoyed stellar sales pushing back sales of iPhones in many markets according to Kantar World Markets The Galaxy Ss success in meeting the iPhone is not hard to understand It is more powerful has a better camera has an outstanding screen and is backed by an increasingly competitive Android ecosystem with the population of Android devices passing iOS in and pulling away ever since Each year approximately billion Android devices are sold compared with somewhere in the low million range for iOS and MacOS based on my crude estimates That suggests there is a transformation taking place just as Benedict Evans suggests there is and as Evans posits it will affect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>It will also affect Apple This chart from Statista makes the point As Android becomes the new Windows strategic issues confront the other platforms In my view Apple has as much at stake as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but without a base in enterprise Apple is the more vulnerable to the trends At close to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>seems fully priced At Apple shares appear vulnerable I have no
