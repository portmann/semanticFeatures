Alpha Satya Nadella and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is trying to get its focus back and present a coherent vision The approach to Windows appears to be a preview of how it is changing how it does business Regaining focus on what it does best and concentrating on the speed of the market are two vital components of the current effort to reposition itself James Stewarts column Common Sense in the New York Times reiterates some rules for those who hope to prosper in the world of the information network The rules are not that profound but they often become forgotten in a world that changes so rapidly especially for those that have achieved some success in the space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corp NYSE MSFT has certainly achieved success in the past However the company is going through a process of refocusing itself and working out a vision of what it wants to be in the future The starting point of Mr Stewarts article is Microsofts recent charges relating to its acquisition of Nokias NYSE NOK phone unit However the best information in his piece comes toward the end Mr Stewart deals with some of this refocusing but then later in his article he gets at some of the rules that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>leadership needs to observe in working out their vision of the future Satya Nadella Microsofts CEO has to carry the main responsibility for the development of this vision and judging from many the writing of many other observers he has not yet been able to consolidate his thinking into one memorable picture of where he thinks things are going The interesting thing is that Mr Stewart quotes a spokesman from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Frank X Shaw to emphasize his points First there is the argument that the company must focus on the things it does well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>over the past fifteen years has strayed far from this advice It was able to do so because it had its Windows platform that was the standard in the industry and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>lived off of the dominant position it had established in the s Of course for management achieving this dominance proved to them if not the world that they were super smart However for the next ten to fifteen years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>leadership in all it did with all the products it got into added little or nothing to the value of the franchise The price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock basically flat lined the s until Mr Nadella became the CEO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>it can be argued lost its focus on the things it did well Now in its efforts to refocus Mr Nadella in an email to employees this month wrote We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem Hence the Windows released this week The new strategy is not to create a wonderful grand scheme like it did in the past but to continue to manufacture Windows phones and other products only differentiate them and make them leaders in specific markets like for business owners Mr Shaw contends that Instead of just thinking about our products running on our devices were thinking about how we reach people no matter what device theyre using In the way Mr Shaw continues our differentiated products will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to focus on the things we do best the products we do well This leads to a second point In doing what it did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>like many other companies tried to develop a grand scheme connected with its platform and failed badly One economist that Mr Stewart quotes Nicholas Economides of NYU Mot people didnt believe that such a catastrophe could occur this fast Early in the s it was noted that companies that produced information goods had to be very nimble and come to market regularly at a very rapid pace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was one of the early leaders in time pacing introducing products or services to market based upon time rather than upon whether or not the new product or the new version of the product was a complete and finished entity Time was the driver Building a grand scheme with many integrated components where our products were running on our devices was not conducive to time pacing To Mr Nadella and Mr Shaw the importance of Windows is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>recognized a pressing need to innovate Mr Shaw added to his comments If you miss the first wave you have to hang on and then drive or anticipate the next wave We want to be part of the next wave of disruption This is not easy to do yet it is consistent with what it takes to achieve success in this space It is especially not easy to do in a large complex corporation And herein lies the problem Can Mr Nadella return to basics and focus on what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does best and can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>recharge itself to hit the next wave on a regular basis Telling us how he is going to do this is a basic part of Mr Nadellas picture of the future and his ability to convincingly convey that picture on to others Source <span style='background-color:
