GOOG GOOGL INTC LN LNKD MSFT MU NXPI SNE TCEHY This Eye on Tech newsletter looks at the MicrosoftLinkedIn deal the unveiling of the Xbox One S and new Xbox gaming services and Apples numerous WWDC announcements Also covered A leaked roadmap for Intels highspeed Optane SSDs Baidus Q warning and the sale of an NXP chip unit New Google business tools and Citron Researchs Facebook short call also get attention <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is buying LinkedIn for B It looks as if those April rumors among traders had some truth to them Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT board had said it wants a faster shift towards cloud revenue streams and buying LinkedIn NYSE LNKD which respectively sports and consensus estimates of B and B certainly helps out at a price That price is nearly below LinkedIns week high but still equal to x consensus EPS There are two tracks along which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the worlds preeminent provider of IT productivity tools can reap synergies from buying the worlds preeminent professional social network One is using Microsofts resources to further the reach of and augment LinkedIns services which have faced some execution issues lately LinkedIns recruiting services of Q revenue and taking share can be offered by Microsofts army of salesmen and resellers as can its online learning services Its Sales Navigator social selling tool can be bundled with Microsofts Dynamics CRM apps And as indicated by a slide deck for the deal LinkedIns news feed can be enhanced with work content gleaned from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apps and pushed to Windows users via notifications Who knows maybe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can even revamp LinkedIns oftmocked UI and notifications Still the second track is arguably more interesting It involves using LinkedIns oneofakind datasets both for the work backgrounds of its users and the professional relationships between them and various companies and institutions to create an identity layer for and proactively share profilecontact info and deliver business insights via Windows Office Skype for Business Cortana and Dynamics This data could also help provide better analytics tools to businesses for understanding their workforce While gauging the acquisitions success along the first track should be pretty straightforward putting concrete numbers on the second will be a lot harder Just how much LinkedIn integration will boost sales of Office or Skype for Business subscriptions or increase Microsofts pricing power for them wont be easy to quantify Its clear though the company is convinced LinkedIns data will give it a valuable way to differentiate as it deals with Google Apps Slack Ciscos NASDAQ CSCO WebEx and many other rival products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>fell following the announcement The deal could bring a debt balance that was above B at the end of calendar Q north of B <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also had over B in cashinvestments at the end of Q but much of it was offshore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>unveils the Xbox One S and new gaming services shares details about Project Scorpio As rumored the Xbox One S is smaller than the regular Xbox One and supports K video and HDR gamingvideo Its start price is lower than that of the PlayStation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also used the E gaming conference to show off Xbox Play Anywhere a feature that lets certain Xbox One games be downloaded and played on Windows PCs with users able to pick up on a saved PC game on their console and vice versa In addition users will be able to form gaming clubs and access a service to find other gamers to play against Project Scorpio the rumored K gamingcapable Xbox due in was confirmed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>disclosed the console will courtesy of CPUGPU supplier AMD deliver over TFLOPs of GPU processing power and GBs of memory bandwidth up sharply from the TFLOPs and GBs delivered by the current Xbox One A Kcapable PS is expected later this year Meanwhile a rumored Chromecastlike streaming stick wasnt announced and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a few days removed from disclosing it has put plans to add DVR functionality to the Xbox One on hold Whereas Redmond once tried hard to pitch the Xbox as a living room entertainment hub its Xbox announcements now heavily revolve around gaming With smart TVs and sub streaming devices proliferating rapidly theres a logic to downplaying home entertainment ambitions and instead directing resources towards battling Sony NYSE SNE for the wallets of gamers Apple reveals iOS macOS Sierra watchOS revamped appsservices at WWDC Siri AI messaging and open platforms received a lot of attention during this years batch of Apple NASDAQ AAPL developer conference announcements As rumored Siri was opened up to developers looking to provide their Siripowered voice assistant services But Apple also opened up Maps to thirdparty extensions examples given include making OpenTable bookings and hailing UberLyft rides from the Maps app And iMessage is joining Facebook Messenger Tencents OTCPKTCEHY WeChat and Line Pending LN in supporting thirdparty apps payments and stickers But the rumored iMessage Android app could provide a big boost to iMessages network effect in a very competitive market didnt arrive Amid concerns Apple is falling behind Google GOOG GOOGL just launched a conversational voice assistant Amazon AMZN has built a large ecosystem for Alexa and others when it comes to AIpowered services Siri is getting a fresh AI infusion intelligent suggestions are provided based on a users typing Meanwhile AI is being deployed within Maps to suggest local places of interest and within the Photos app to detect facesobjects and group relevant pictures The Photos features have much in common with what Google Photos does but its AI work will be handled ondevice rather than in the cloud Apple talks up the privacy benefits of doing so Some of the first apps supported by iMessage Source The Verge macOS thats what its called now not Mac OS X is getting Siri and the ability to see the same desktop on multiple devices The Apple WatchwatchOS now supports Apple Pay and can have apps instantly load and show refreshed data and Apple TVtvOS is getting YouTube voice search and a revamped remote app But its worth remembering iOS powers the hardware responsible for the lions share of Apples profits Here Apple disclosed iOS will support richer notifications and can use D Touch to drive interactions and pull up content via both lockscreen and standard notifications iOS also adds voicemail transcriptions a lowkey but pretty useful feature Devices that can be controlled by a new iOS Home app Source Ars Technica While nothing earthshaking was announced as usual WWDCs focus is on software services and making developers happy Apple did open up more platforms to developers than expected and also showed a greater embrace of AI than expected Both moves show a healthy understanding of what the competition is doing and of whats needed to avoid having core apps and services get marginalized as Facebook Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and especially Google bet big on AIdriven cloud services that can be leveraged by third parties A roadmap for Intels highspeed Optane SSDs gets leaked The roadmap pictured below shows the very first Optane platforms codenamed Mansion Beach meant for workstations and Stony Beach meant for server accelerator cards arriving at years end with both supporting the nextgen NVMe storage interface much faster than SATA An Optane platform codenamed Brighton Beach appears meant for workstations and highend PCs is due in early Optane relies on Intel NASDAQ INTC and Microns NASDAQ MU D XPoint nextgen memory its much faster and more durable than NAND flash memory while costing more much cheaper and denser than DRAM but somewhat slower and like NAND doesnt lose data when power is lost Early benchmarks have shown Optane SSDs trouncing NAND SSDs Baidu issues a Q warning shares tumble The warning arrives less than six weeks after a regulatory probe began due to the death of a student who attempted a cancer treatment discovered via Baidus NASDAQ BIDU paid search listings The probe resulted in tougher regulations for medical ads as well as in Baidu reducing the number of sponsored listings on a search page to no more than of the pages total Baidu now indicates both of these factors weighed on Q sales Two takeaways Beware Chinese regulatory probes fueled by public outcries just ask Yum Brands Paid search while a very lucrative business for a dominant search engine is also one in which even slight changes to how ads are presented sold or bid can have big ripple effects Google is known to do extensive AB testing for even the smallest search changes NXP sells analogpower management chip unit to Chinese buyers for B One of the buyers is JAC Capital which in line with Chinas aggressive efforts to grow its local chip industry also happened to acquire another NXP NASDAQ NXPI unit last year for B Bloomberg previously reported the analogpower management chip unit known as Standard Products was on the block and that NXP could get over B Standard Products saw revenue drop YY in Q The sale will help NXP lower a debt load that thanks partly to the companys recent acquisition of rival Freescale totaled B at the end of Q and allow it to focus on opportunities in the automotive IoT networking and secure transaction EMVsmart cardNFC chip markets Google launches AIpowered Springboard app for businesses revamps Google Sites Though Apples AI announcements got much more attention Google added one more machine learningdriven solution to its arsenal Springboard an app meant for Google Apps for Work users proactively delivers content and recommendations to office workers thats

make web publishing easier Citron Research shorts Facebook Facebook NASDAQ FB is losing market share to Snapchat and overstaying its welcome in other niches I am not saying Facebook is a bad company it just will not be a B company in a year says Citron Researchs Andrew Left Though its track record isnt perfect Citron has done pretty well lately Valeant NYSE VRX Mobileye NYSE MBLY and Ambarella NASDAQ AMBA are among the Citron shorts disclosed over the last months that are well below where they traded when Citron first announced its position Facebook closed down Citron isnt the first to argue Snapchats Private CHAT rapid growth is a problem for Facebook and others have also made the case declining personal sharing is an issue For now daily active user growth YY in Q to B remains healthy and ad revenue growth in Q remains torrid with the help of an allout push to monetize Instagram Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
