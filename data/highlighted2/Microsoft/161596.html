transformation for the telecom industry big data analytics Silicon Photonics data memorystorage and customizedprogrammable processors Strategy Accelerate TAM in high performance computing cloud and big data by making it easier to implement more efficient cloudbased computing with software stack development Strategy Gain share in communications industry by making network virtualization easier to deploy and by building easy to use software stacks Strategy Increase Intel silicon footprint in addition to processors through deployment of SiliconPhotonics new memorystorage and accelerators Intel is not just PCs of Intel earnings from DCG Data Center Group is not just processors and software limits DCG deployment not processors Intel NASDAQ INTC Data Center Group has guided to CAGR for the next three years A bold position This article will explore what strategies Intel DCG is deploying to accomplish this bold guidance and what could take Intel off of this path to go higher or lower Please keep in mind that this CAGR applies to sales Earnings could be higher or lower Past experience indicates that if Intel beats this CAGR in sales then profits will be much higher eg Q saw YOY sales increase and over earnings increase The opposite also is true If CAGR does not reach then earnings growth is lower Q saw sales growth and less than earnings growth This quick analysis indicates the importance of reaching or exceeding the CAGR in sales growth in DCG More and more the public and stock market are recognizing the importance of the DCG to Intels bottom line and future growth But this recognition has a long way to go The Intel share price is still largely influenced by PC sales news and very little is said about the Intel DCG Last Friday Intel had a fullday program on the Intel Data Center the Intel Data Center Day I saw very little news coming out about the event Maybe thats largely the failure of Intel to spread the word about this event Its their first such event so maybe they wanted to do kind of a soft opening The event was full of great information about Intel DCG strategies and products I already wrote one article about Silicon Photonics Again I know some get annoyed with my reminders more then half of Intel earnings come from the DCG Intel is moving away from reliance on PC earnings While PC sales are still a significant part of Intel revenues the impact on earnings is decreasing Intel also is moving away from reliance on selling just processors into data centers Intel is expanding their silicon footprint in data centers Diane Bryant Intel DCG Manager has been very clear on DCG strategies and showed off her excellent team at the Intel Data Center Day Her stated strategies are in three main areas Accelerate TAM in high performance computing cloud big data by making it easier to implement more efficient cloudbased computing with software stack development Gain share in communications industry by making network virtualization easier to deploy and by building easy to use software stacks Increase Intel silicon footprint in addition to processors through deployment of Silicon Photonics new memorystorage and accelerators Accelerate TAM Diane clearly stated that Intel processors are not holding back DCG sales the limitation is the ease of using the powerful processors to analyze big data and implement cloudbased applications Very large companies can invest in big data analytics and cloudbased computing to take advantage of the technology opportunities Medium and smaller companies find it difficult to cost effectively take advantage of Big Data analytics and cloudbased computing Intels strategy is to make it easier to analyze big data and deploy cloudbased computing An analogy can be found in the growth of PCs Having a great PC processor did not result in huge processor sales Easy to use software was key to increasing PC processor sales think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows and Office The same is now true with big data analytics and cloudbased computing The tech geeks now use these but nongeeks find their use challenging Intels strategy is to get the power and advantages associated with cloudbased computing and big data analytics in the hands of regular business type folks A part of this strategy is to invest in a wide variety of software development companies and open source organizations to make it easier to use Big Data analytics and cloudbased computing By making these new technologies easier to use the uses will increase and the demand for more data center processors will increase dramatically Intel likes to mention the Jevons Paradox Jevons paradox occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used reducing the amount necessary for any one use but the rate of consumption of that resource rises because of increasing demand Intel research has shown that the biggest restraint to growth of DCG is easy to use cloud and big data analytics software Investing in cloud and big data software development is a critical strategy for Intel Intel is eyeing to of these investments over the next year Easier to use cloud and big data software stacks will send cloud computing hardware Intel processors sales through the roof far above CAGR The TAM total addressable market will grow and Intel dominates sales of processors into this TAM by meeting the needs of over of the market Slower Cloud buildout in enterprise could lower DCG below CAGR IF easy to use software stacks are not developed quickly Network Virtualization for the telecom industry Expansion of processor sales into the telecom communications industry is the biggest growth area for DCG In the past telecom communications companies relied upon custom processors for their telephone switching and data needs They are now seeing the cost of providing this custom approach exceeding the amount people are willing to pay for the services Smartphones have rapidly accelerated the demand for data movement through telecom switches As with cloud computing and big data analytics the limitation to Intel processor sales to the telecom industry is not the hardware the limitation is software Tremendous amounts of software development is needed to move telecom functions from expensive single purpose processors to general purpose processors plus supplied by Intel The demand for this software Intel encouraged software development as well as telecom industry demand is outstripping the pool of software developers that have the necessary skill sets Machine learning is expected to have an expanding role in this software development Diane noted that network transformation replacing single purpose processors with general purpose Intel processors could grow DCG significantly above the guided CAGR IF the necessary software can be developed more quickly Increase Intel silicon footprint in data centers Much has been written in Seeking Alpha about new developments in memorystorage D NAND and D XPoint Silicon Photonics and accelerators Altera FPGAs The main point here is that these new products will increase Intels footprint within the data center Intel can grow sales into these adjacent markets while still increasing sales and value associated with Intel processors Sales other than processors in were of DCG sales The contribution of these nonprocessor sales is expected to grow to by Putting this in dollars increases the drama b growing to b in as the CAGR increases sales And Diane pointed out that revenues from memory product sales like D NAND and D XPoint do not show up in DCG revenues Future risks and opportunities in DCG In the discussion above I pointed out that Intels guided CAGR for DCG could be exceeded if software development for network virtualization in the telecom industry can be sped up Conversely if software development to make cloudbased computing and big data analytics easier to use does not develop as fast as expected DCG could fall short of CAGR These were noted by Diane as the two areas that could most significantly impact Intels ability to achieve a CAGR in DCG sales Diane also made a point that cloud service provider demand is unpredictable Even cloud service providers have a huge challenge in predicting their needs This is likely a result of the immature nature of the industry as well as the small number of big cloud service providers compared to numerous enterprise users Diane also pointed to Intels concerns over data center demand from China China has grown to be a significant portion of DCG sales over the last few years as China works to use technology to solve their huge challenges Intel will be carefully watching demand for DCG products in China especially in HPC I was surprised at the huge emphasis that Intel DCG is placing on software development to accelerate demand for DCG products This software development needs to make it easier for techies and nontechies to unlock the huge potential of big data analytics cloud computing efficiencies and network virtualization Im pleased that Intel is recognizing this need and taking active steps to address the need for
