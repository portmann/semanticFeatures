continues to do whats right by shareholders Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a leader worth following CEO Satya Nadella has been nothing but direct and has led with distinction since replacing the inept and prickly Steve Ballmer at the helm The market has clearly applauded Nadellas recent moves with shares rallying since early April This is in the face of a tough macro market that has reached multiyear high levels of stress Nadella has been focused in his strategy which he further outlined and clarified in a letter to employees recently The strategy would include tough choices and a clear business product focus going forward Still Nadellas leadership comes from a place of awareness and reality that his predecessor had never visited let alone led from Nadella also noted clearly that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would need dualuse customers if it were to return to market share dominance of past levels This means consumer as well as business Apparently obtaining those dualuse customers means a tear down and rebuild of the companys phone portfolio And good riddance to it in its current iteration Even the most ardent Windowsphone and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>generalist fanboys cant argue that the line is competitive at the highest levels With Nadella letting go of employees primarily from the phone business this follows jobs from this segment a year ago a fresh start will be at hand An expensive fresh start with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>forced to write down billion a charge that exceeds the disgusting and disgraceful prize paid for Nokia but still a fresh start So what does this mean for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>going forward I think it means that Nadella will continue to captain a trimming of the product portfolio as he has done most effectively so far into his overseeing of affairs and a focus on total ecosystem Yes Nadella also has been clear about that He demands that if a product is under the umbrella and if a product is branded under the company name that the product contribute synergistically to the sum of the parts I believe this means an increased spend and focus on business productivity an increased focus on total hardware inclusive of gaming and business hardware Surface Pro Surface Hub etc and an aggression from an MA standpoint that will be much much more focused MA under the Ballmer regime was sloppy at best and deliberately negligent at worst Nadella will prefer to use a scalper rather than a chainsaw and that is a very very good thing for shareholders I anticipate several nearterm and midterm acquisitions focused around the business productivity suite and the companys corefoundational platform its looking to build on the nonconsumer side I also anticipate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues to look for ways to embellish its gaming suite and ancillary revenue capture there While a massive write down is never a good thing todays egg on the face is one of the last remaining relics from one of the more shameful eras in company history The Ballmer mistakes of the past are being thrown out and the companys figurative hands washed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues
