class='textDiv'>Why Intel Needs Xiaomi Intel Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha The nanometer Cherry Trail Atom X is important toward improving Intels mobile chip sales Intel needs more OEMs to use the Atom X mobile processors Xiaomi is now exclusively using the Intel Atom X for the Android and Windows models of the Mi Pad We now know why Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA issued a cheaper Tegra Kpowered Android tablet Xiaomi one the worlds top vendors of smartphones has decided to exclusively use an Intel NASDAQ INTC Atom Cherry Trail processor for its iPad Minilooking Mi Pad Aside from the Nexus Nvidias only major design win for its Tegra K SoC last year was Xiaomis original Mi Pad Xiaomis decision to use the Atom xZ for both the Android and Windows versions of the Mi Pad is detrimental to Nvidia On the other hand Xiaomi could help Intel recover from its yearoveryear drop in Q tablet processor sales The Xiaomi Mi Pad design wins relevance will be more apparent after Q I see this product as a reference design for more Cherry Trailpowered tablets next year The Intelpowered Mi Pad was already rumored last December Xiaomis defection to the latest x tablet SoC of Intel meant it underwent a long testing process Intels nm quadcore xZ apparently has satisfied all the performanceenergy efficiency requirements of Xiaomi Global OEMs like Xiaomi can help Intel improve sales for its Cherry Trail mobile processors Ashraf Eassa already speculated earlier this year that Intel might face difficulty ramping up support for Cherry Trail processors This pessimism was understandable because Intel is now allegedly only willing to offer subsidies for its Cherry Trail Atom SoCs Wider industry support for the and Cherry Trail mobile processors the Z and Z would likely contribute lower operating losses for Intel in Intel previously offered discounts on its older era Bay Trail processors to tablet vendors Yes the tablet industry is posting declining sales This is due to the proliferation of phablets and in hybrid notebooktablet products However I believe that any product category that helps Intel make inroads in the mobile sector is important Intels original hype for its nm Cherry Trail SoCs is to provide more energy efficient but more powerful processors for tablets Xiaomis selection of the xZ help validates this Intel claim Intel investors should never lose hope when it comes to the commercial relevance of x mobile chips against ARMbased processors I believe Cherry Trail Atom processors are now competitive with MediaTek ARM SoCs Cherry Trail processors have a total addressable market greater than just a Surface andor a dirtcheap Teclast Windows tablet The possibility that tablet vendors will now abandon lesssubsidized Cherry Trail Atom chips in favor of ARMbased processors is no longer worrisome I expect other AndroidWindows tablet vendors to emulate the example set by Xiaomi in going allIntel for its latest tablet product Whitebox Chinese tablet manufacturers that survive on lowmargin products will remain clients of Intel The fact that a recent nanometer x SoC could be used inside a Android Mi Pad and a Windows allmetal tablet says it is still a costeffective component for premiumlevel midrange priced tablets It was actually cheaper for Xiaomi to use Intels tablet chip The Tegra Kequipped plasticmade Mi Pad retailed for in China last year Intel will continue to do brisk business with Chinese whitebox manufacturers The versatility of one x SoC that could be used for Android and Windows tablets allows marginspressured Chinese whitebox manufactures to differentiate their products against other ARMbased tablets Unlike an ARMbased Tegra K or Snapdragon processor the Cherry Trail Atom SoC could be used in dualOS Windows Android tablets like the Teclast X Having a dualOS tablet is a differentiating factor that Chinese manufacturers could use as an excuse to sell their products at a higher margin I also expect Teclast and other whitebox tablet vendors to lower the prices of their current higherend Cherry Trailpowered products so they remain competitive with the Xiaomi Mi Pad The cheaper Cherry Trailpowered tablets become the more people will be able to afford them Why Xiaomis Support Is Most Welcome Xiaomis reputation for high quality products and its ability to sell copycat versions of Apple products could mean the Mi Pad will become a big hit in China Other pricesensitive markets like the Philippines India and Latin America will also appreciate a iPad Minilooking Windows inch tablet As of now Asustek OTCASUUY is the only major global tablet vendor that uses Intel x Atom SoCs for its tablet products I expect Xiaomis more powerful brand power to eventually eclipse the commercial appeal of Intelpowered Asus ZenPad Android tablets next year Asustek also no longer sells Windowsbased standalone tablets It only sells Windows Windows in tabletnotebook devices Xiaomis inch Android or Windows tablet could therefore cater to customers who only want cheaper alternatives to the iPad Mini The marketing power of Xiaomi is also no longer handicapped by limitedtimeonly online sales Xiaomi already opened its first physical retail store in Beijing last September Intel has future rewards if Xiaomi also aggressively copies the successful retail chain of Apple Stores around the world I opine that if Intel cannot get its mobile processors inside Apple iPads the next best thing is for Intel to get them inside lowerpriced clones of the iPad I expect this firstever collaboration between Intel and Xiaomi to expand beyond tablets Longterm investors should not discount the possibility that Xiaomi could someday use an Intelmade smartphone processor Going forward Intel could reap greater benefits if Xiaomi imitates Asusteks act of using Intel Atom processors in Android phones Once Intel delivers Gintegrated SoFIA x Atom chips next year I assume Xiaomi will evaluate them for possible use in its lowerend Android phones Xiaomi could also create full Windows versions of its highend Android phonesphablets using an xz Like other mobile gadget vendors Xiaomi could sell far more units of smartphones than tablets Intels future relevance in the mobile chips industry will only gain the respect of investors if more top phone vendors use its x smartphone processors Compared to Xiaomi Asustek is really only a minor player in the smartphone industry There is almost zero chance that Samsung OTCSSNLF will use Intelmade smartphone processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is also likely still bound to an exclusivity deal for years with Qualcomm Aside from Asustek I therefore see Xiaomi as the next viable client for smartphone processors from Intel Xiaomi is also expanding toward Internet of Things products Xiaomi now only has a smart fitness health wristband in the Mi Band S I anticipate Xiaomi to eventually come up with a real smartwatch product to compete with the Apple Watch and the Intelpowered Tag Heuer Connected I also look forward to Intel also supplying the even highermargin processors for Xiaomis first ever laptop product We
