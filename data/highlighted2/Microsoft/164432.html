class='textDiv'>Apple Dont Overlook The Tablet Potential Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital Stone Fox Capital clicks The stagnating tablet market still has longterm potential The iPad product line still remains the best option for Apple to diversify away from the dominance of the phone products The market projections for the tablet market offer a disappointing future for a product originally expected to offset the weakness in computer sales IDC actually projects some market share gains for Apple NASDAQ AAPL by but the weakness in the overall tablet market is more the story While most of the stock market focuses on the next new products like watches or mobile payments the potential for a rebound in the iPad exists with the next versions set for a November release Several hints exist that Apple could actually see a bigger revenue benefit from the new tablets than the market expects According to a report from Strategic Analytics the larger size tablets will drive demand growth in the enterprise segment The Surface Pro is already the best selling tablet for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT The upcoming release of the iPad Pro with a inch screen is expected to drive enterprise demand for Apple and the sector in general According to data from IDC the tablet market is going to stagnate through but the highend tablets are expected to grow with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>leading the way for now The IDC and Strategic Analytics projections highlight why the market is overlooking the iPad potential in our opinion Combined with Apple only obtaining of revenues from the tablet product line the ability to beat expectations exists for a couple of reasons including the shift to the enterprise tablets with higher ASPs that isnt factored into these projections focused solely on units sold The biggest problem and opportunity with the equation though is the difference in ASPs despite the larger screens for the tablet In the last quarter the iPhone ASP was while the tablet only saw an ASP of The iPad Pro will no doubt increase the ASP but the question remains by how much The average Mac ASP is all the way up at suggesting the enterprise user has the ability to spend significantly more on a pro tablet that offers increased productivity The biggest issue with the previous batch of tablets were they lacked functionality beyond a phone with a bigger screen In my family of a Mac an iPad Air and four iPhones the general demand at night and while traveling is for the iPad The phone though is a requirement for the need to communicate on the go and a tablet just isnt practical for a kid going to school or heading to a friends house The phone though isnt ideal for consuming content Apple needs to figure out the holy grail in the tablet market which is turning it into an enterprise tool and content creator on the go while maintaining the existing benefits on consuming content of a large screen The new iOS and iPad Pro with the larger screen makes a big step toward solving that problem The new operating system allows for multitasking and the ability to watch video in a pictureinpicture mode Along with new enterprise apps from IBM NYSE IBM and suddenly the iPad offers tools that will attract more corporate customers and encourage users to finally upgrade their tablets The dilemma though will remain how a normal consumer can justify the cost of both an iPhone and a iPad The necessity of a kid having a communication device and logically turning that into a game player and other uses makes it difficult to justify having a tablet as well Though lets make it clear that kids and parents alike prefer using the tablet when it is convenient to have on hand With the ASP for a phone over higher than a tablet at Apple has the ability to not only expand the selling price of tablets but also increase the demand levels The watch or a similar wearable device may make the iPad a bigger reality Once a lower cost option exists for simple communications on the go consumers may actually flip over to the iPad as a primary device The lowend listed watch price of makes that prospect feasible especially if future lowercost options become available Lets look at the implications of both a rebound of iPad sales and most importantly a bump up in the ASP Considering the anticipated release of the iPad Pro iPad Air and iPad Mini in November lets review the numbers on the basis of past FQ data Remember that IDC is projecting that iPad units sold remain stable going forward iPad sales peaked two years ago when Apple sold million units for a ASP of The ASP actually dipped from back in FQ The lowerpriced Mini and older versions continue contributing to the lower prices Imagine if Apple is able to achieve an increase in ASP with higher prices of the iPad Pro Assuming at least a starting price and possibly higher for the enterprise tablet the company will raise the ASP that hit only in FQ with the iPad Mini at and iPad Air at Based on what IDC projects of somewhat stable unit sales the following table highlights the potential revenue impact of equivalent unit levels of the past combined with a higher ASP The base units match the FQ units and the peak units matches the FQ record levels The estimates assume an equal spit between the unit types at the base level with any upside from higher Pro sales needed to reach peak levels The table assumes that the iPad Pro has a base price and gets an ASP bump from a mix of higher priced versions so the initial estimate is per tablet As far as the Air and Mini versions the base price is used as the ASP assuming an equal amount of older versions at the typical reduced price and customers willing to pay up to for more storage on newer versions Investors can play around with the units per tablet type and ASP to achieve different outcomes but the analysis provides a basic view of the impact of higher ASPs along with the estimates of stable units sold Assuming the base units level is a repeat of FQ units of million iPad sales jump roughly billion from last year based on the higher sales price of the Pro Using a peak case of the FQ units level of million and the skew towards the Pro version with the incremental sales above the base level revenues jump billion from last year and up roughly billion from the peak two years ago of billion Considering analysts forecast total revenue only growing to billion the expectations arent very high for the iPad Last FQ the iPad only produced revenues of billion on the million units sold With the expected bump from higher iPhone sPlus sales and the inclusion of the watch for the first holiday season any increase from the tablet segment is a huge bump up to total sales With up to of consumers having not upgraded to an iPhone and CEO Tim Cook suggesting that sales in China remain strong the limited growth projections would have to require lower revenue from the iPad and Mac categories that accounted for only of revenues last holiday quarter Based on the above analysis the tablet could actually provide large upside potential that combined with any contribution from the watch leads to solid growth on top of whatever the iPhone generates The tablet market is definitely down but it doesnt mean that opportunity doesnt exist If given an option most consumers would prefer using an iPad over an iPhone If Apple can make the iPad Pro into an enterprise tool the tablet segment could return to growth and that isnt in current analysts projections The prediction is that iPad revenue surprises on the high side even without an increase in units sold Combined with robust iPhone s and watch sales Apple easily beats analyst estimates for the important December quarter The market has all but given up on the tablet segment providing a surprise catalyst for the stock Apple shareholders win with the stock trading at
