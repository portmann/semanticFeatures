class='textDiv'>With Major Concentration Risk AVG Isnt Compelling At x EPS AVG Technologies NYSEAVG Seeking Alpha While many investors worry about the declining PC TAM I think thats a sideshow AVGs huge reliance on the Yahoo search deal is much more concerning If Yahoos new owners whoever they may be are smart they will squeeze AVG which looks to have no credible alternatives neither Google nor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>make a lot of sense If search revenue were to decline dramatically AVG would suddenly look pretty expensive for a business struggling to gain traction with new initiatives I do think theres a longterm story here but its not worth the risk until theres more certainty around the future of the search business I always try to be objective but Im only human Going into my due diligence I was prepared to like AVG NYSE AVG on account of its modest valuation and recurring revenues As a longtime user of its free security software on one of my laptops and a subscriber to Intels NASDAQ INTC McAfee on another I appreciate its product and believe the annuitylike revenue from desktop subscriptions is likely stickier than many give them credit for As a recent adoptee of its free mobile security suite and competitors apps to track the location of family members and so on I also see the potential for AVGs Zen platform to be a unified securityprivacy hub across devices The challenge unfortunately is that AVG looks like a binary bet at this point If the subscription businesses were blowing it out of the water and new products like mobile and the HMA VPN were likely to drive significant growth and margin over time AVG would look quite cheap if the company could stabilize and sustain its absurdly lucrative searchtoolbar revenues Unfortunately Im not sure thats the case and in the meanwhile search is a big risk Not only is the installed search toolbar base likely to continue to decline over time but I believe the ongoing auction of the Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO assets adds significant event risk to the story The decision to exit thirdparty search was good and necessary but contrary to assertions by management and some analysts that this is an issue in the rearview mirror I still view the remaining search business under its current terms as a major overhang on which investors need to focus With the caveat that Ive been involved in a few situations where businesses lost that one key contract you never thought theyd lose and it decimated the business I must say that Im incredibly surprised there isnt more focus on the sustainability or potential lack thereof of AVGs search business which is still a material component of revenues and a major profit driver A lot of the declines in the search business over the past few years have been related to the planned exit from the thirdparty search business which is basically wrapped up this year That was absolutely the right call but while management seems to believe the rest of the search business is pretty okay I think its still a big risk factor for shareholders Heres why On one level consumers ongoing transition from browsing on PCs to mobile devices obviates a lot of potential revenue for the search business above and beyond the inherent rate of decline in the PC installed base That may not sound like a big deal but the remaining downloaddriven search toolbar business is an extremely material contributor to AVGs financial results and Im not sure the average market participant understands exactly to what degree this is true While search represented less than of revenue in Q and the full year it punches way above its weight in gross margin Given that theres essentially no direct cost associated with this business users install a toolbar and AVG gets a cut of search revenues from Yahoo and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL mostly Yahoo its extremely high margin Indeed in Q the search and other business generated nearly million of gross profit or over of the quarters nonGAAP operating income and in the full year it represented over million of gross profit again over of operating income Why is this a big deal Well management doesnt talk about it much instead prefer to go on about Zen and SMB and other growth areas but there is a biggerthanzero chance that the entire search business could go away or at the very least be materially reduced in size An excerpt from the risk factor on page of AVGs F filing bears close reading The majority of platformderived revenue is generated from agreements with search providers including nonexclusive agreements with Yahoo and Google which generated and of our total revenue in We anticipate that this revenue concentration risk will persist as we expect that Yahoo and Google will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue going forward The agreement with Yahoo expires on June Neither Yahoo nor Google is under any obligation to renew its agreement If upon the termination or expiration of our agreements we fail to enter into new agreements with Yahoo or Google or a similar search provider on substantially the same or more favorable terms our revenue would significantly decrease Other search engine providers or market participants could require certain permissions that were not included in our initial contracts with them and if these permissions are not granted we could be prevented from offering the toolbar or search solutions as we otherwise would These changes could have a significant negative impact on our ability to monetize our users through our dynamic search solution If there are further guideline or commercial changes from any or all of our search providers which we are unable to mitigate or if additional search providers decide to adopt an opt in policy we may not be able to sustain our search revenue While the profitability of this search revenue stream has varied over time by the end of it was among our most profitable revenue streams and therefore ongoing declines are expected to further impact margins and profitability We may also be unsuccessful in diversifying our search revenue and Yahoo and Google will likely remain responsible in the near term for the majority of our platformderived revenue so we will likely continue to have significant revenue concentration risk Such contract renewals are always a source of risk but with the high likelihood that Yahoo will be under new management when this contract expires its an even bigger risk than usual It is wellestablished at this point that Yahoo has been severely mismanaged over the past few years the companys efforts to become hip via the illfated purchase of Tumblr among other things have largely failed and the core business is not turning around Within this context the first order of business for a financiallyoriented buyer ie much of the rumored bidder group is probably to eke as much cash flow out of the declining assets as possible while figuring out what to do with the rest of the business from a strategic standpoint As bad as things may be for Yahoo it seems pretty clear if only on the basis of relative revenues and gross profits that AVG needs Yahoo much more than Yahoo needs AVG Worse yet AVG doesnt have any easy alternatives Ask yourself this if Yahoo plays hardball come negotiation time where exactly is AVG going to go Back to Google where AVG has not done itself any favors recently thanks to egregiously bad security vulnerabilities in its Web TuneUp software that put Chrome users at risk To Bing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT which is trying to become more Applelike and whose new Edge browser in Windows isnt even compatible with AVG TuneUp per recent forum posts by AVG customer support So it seems like you have a negotiating situation that is pretty much in favor of Yahoo and while old management may not have cared about such pedantic things as maximizing cash flow from the declining businesses they have left new management very likely will It doesnt seem likely that AVGs search revenue will go away entirely but the most likely scenario is that they get pretty significantly squeezed which could result in a dramatic hit to operating margins and an even bigger hit to equity earnings given the debt I will admit that this discussion is a bit onesided to some extent AVG could probably replace some though not all of foregone search revenuesprofits by monetizing the free product in another way It could integrate advertising into the app bundle or push downloads of another product etc but all of the alternatives would seem to be materially less profitable and significantly more branddilutive than the current arrangement I could understand the case for accepting the binary Yahoo renewal risk if the rest of AVGs business was compelling but frankly its not Vince Martin has already done a good job of highlighting some of the issues with SMB and other segments but early doesnt suggest that AVG has made all that much progress First of all total users declined sequentially by desktop mobile and even more significantly yy from million at the end of Q to million at the end of Q Some of this is related to weak PCsmartphone sales as well as managements intentional moves to optimize marketing spend From a broader perspective though slowing mobile user growth this early in the game clearly isnt a good sign Management is doing a much better job of monetizing mobile with million of organic revenue growth but these gains are for now still going to be offset by weakness in desktop and legacy search So too with the SMB segment which is projected to reach breakeven this year after allocation of corporate costs In the first quarter revenue of million was flat year on year while management attributes this to a lower renewal pool a technology business either needs to be growing rapidly or making a lot of money Revenues were supposed to be flat to modestly up but the anticipated bookings growth is not yet materializing with firstquarter bookings of million actually down vs million last year thanks to both lower SMB and consumer desktop renewal While management may be projecting adjusted net income of per share at the midpoint if you treat stockbased compensation as a real expense you get somewhere in the s implying a current PE multiple of x With some leverage on the balance sheet and the likelihood that lucrative search revenues will continue to decline possibly dramatically that doesnt look like a cheap multiple to me If AVG gets mobileSMB to drive more profitability taking pressure off search and the Yahoo deal is renewed next year on favorable terms then the stock will likely start to look more interesting For now though despite a tempting valuation the risk is just too high Disclaimer Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions Any investment involves
