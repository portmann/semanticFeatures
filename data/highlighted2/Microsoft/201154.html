sales for Apples NASDAQ AAPL Mac computers this past quarter These have been centered around estimates by analysis firms IDC and Gartner IDC estimates that Apple sold only million Macs in the September quarter for a year over year decrease Gartner is less pessimistic predicting sales at million units but the growth would be the slowest since In reply Chuck Jones at Forbes posted his analysis as to why IDCs Estimates For Apples Mac Sales Look Too Low PC sales as a whole are shrinking down this quarter and Gartners numbers give Apple a market share a growth of over a year ago The IDC data is a bit different but still shows growth in Apple market share Its likely that part of this growth has come from increased adoption of Macs in the business sector in both smallmedium businesses and in the enterprise These inroads have been led by Apples mobile iOS devices which lead in the enterprise ComputerWorld writes With iPad Pro Apple pushes further into the enterprise This opens still more opportunities for the Mac Difficulty in integrating Macs into an existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT environment Higher initial cost for Mac purchases Each of these is a complex discussion by itself and I do not intend to offer arguments for and against here But I believe the last is up for a disruption While many believe that real lower total cost of ownership of Macs justifies buying the higher priced hardware a lot of businesses look solely at the initial cost Apple currently provides no offering at a lower price point Currently the lowest priced MacBook Air is at and the Mac Mini a fine starter desktop begins at just but this is with no keyboard mouse or display I hypothesize it will be the MacBook Ether Like Chromebooks it will be basically designed to be an internet appliance running lowkey apps locally and productivity applications in the cloud And last year I suggested that a new Mac would come aimed at the enterprise It would be a fullfledged Mac OS X running on an Apple Aseries processor In that post I hypothesized that it would be a beefed up A This still has not happened but perhaps there is a new hint from Apple that this might change this year In another post I explained how Apples modus operandi includes the ability to wait until technology reaches a level that allows a leap Certainly now that time has arrived for ARM NASDAQ ARMH based processors The hint comes directly from Apple itself during the iPad Pro announcement in comments by Apples VP of marketing Phil Schiller who spent quite a bit of time extolling the speed of the new device In point after point he noted x the speed of the previous iPad Air that graphics processing has increased times from the original iPad and so on For a description of what the various parts of a computer are and how they function see my tech blog The telling point however were his comparisons to desktop computers This is desktopclass performance Its faster than percent of the portable PCs that shipped in the last months thats at CPU tasks At graphics tasks its faster than percent of them In a forum post on ArsTechnica member Keylimesoda notes that he has made some preliminary estimates for speed of the new Ax processor He writes I predict an iPad Pro Geekbench score of Single Multi This is increase over the iU common in most ultrabooks last year The Geekbench test is a general CPU test and does not include graphics processing an area in which Apple excels in its chip designs Here we can expect even better performance One thing we do know for graphics is that the iPad Pro is driving a huge screen in terms of pixels The screen has a resolution of x pixels per inch for a total of almost million pixels This is greater than the MacBook Pro with a inch Retina Display that has by or million pixels To keep up with this number of pixels requires enormous horsepower If it can do this it can certainly drive a standard computer display Basically all you need to do is create a small box holding the innards of the iPad Pro You can dispense with the display and the battery and add in controllers and connectors for USB Thunderbolt and HDMI and you have a small standalone like the Mac Mini but with a processor that costs in the range of instead of something over This can bring a cost reduction of to or a price reduction of This would bring the new desktop down from the lowest Mac Mini down to the range and would open a whole new category of users Apple is gaining market share and this in spite of being in a higher price range The explanation for this is that Macs are highly desired There must be a reason for this But whatever it is it should lead to a very significant increase in sales should the new device become available as this is the largest market for PCs overall My guess is that this new Mac would garner an additional market share or close to another million units This would bring in an additional billion annually or about per share This is not enormous compared to the EPS of but no mean feat for a single product Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not
