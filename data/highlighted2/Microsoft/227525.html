class='textDiv'>Even With Higher Margins Amazon Wouldnt Be Cheap Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Alhambra Investment Partners Alhambra Partners click Raising profit margins at Amazon isnt that easy Amazons rate of capital spending isnt that extraordinary I was watching an interview with Stanley Druckenmiller the other day when the subject of Amazon NASDAQ AMZN arose Druckenmiller owns the stock and raved about the company saying that unlike a lot of others Amazon was investing in their future He was particularly excited about their cloud business and said that Amazon could ramp up margins and profits whenever they want Thats a sentiment Ive heard from a lot of people over the years when it comes to Amazons serial lack of profits Since we are primarily value investors Amazon rarely comes up for discussion and has never made it through any of our stock screens to be included in any of our model portfolios The stock is just too expensive and the return on invested capital too low for us to consider But this sentiment that Amazon can ramp up profits whenever they want intrigues me Is it possible that Amazon stock is actually cheap enough to consider Could they really just ramp up margins from the current fraction of a percent to something more normal for a retailer Certainly Amazon has in a relatively short period of time become a major player in US retail so they must be doing something right As an avid reader Ive been a fan and customer for a long time And when I buy anything these days like most people I check prices on Amazon before I buy anywhere else because chances are theyre selling it cheaper Amazon has now become part of our culture the go to place for just about anything one needs and plenty one doesnt But the stock price Thats one thing they havent figured out how to discount The stock has always traded for a premium multiple and that is certainly true today at over times next years earnings estimate But if margins could really be expanded at will then maybe the price can be justified Lets forget for a moment that doing that probably isnt as easy as Amazon fans imagine and just make some assumptions to see if there is any way to justify the current price WMT Profit Margin TTM data by YCharts The range for retailers is roughly to For the purposes of our Amazon investigation lets assume they achieve the upper level and raise margins to Thats up from the current by the way a heroic leap but apparently one thats achievable for exceptional retailers For the last months Amazon generated billion in revenue At a profit margin that would generate over billion in earnings or about per share of earnings using the latest diluted share count If we assume that the current growth rate of about persists for the next couple of years earnings would grow to per share At the current price that means an investor is paying almost times earnings two years hence for a company growing at That still seems a bit rich but not nearly as onerous as the multiple based on the current margins Of course it isnt Amazons retail business that really has people excited That honor belongs to Amazon Web Services the cloud business That business is growing rapidly on pace for about billion in sales this year at a margin of about Deutsche Bank recently estimated that the business would grow to billion by and put a X multiple on that revenue and arrived at a value of billion I wouldnt buy it at that price but maybe someone would So if we assume that AWS grows to billion by and Amazons current overall growth rate of continues then AWS will represent roughly of Amazons revenue by that time Even if AWS maintains those margins the impact on Amazons bottom line is not that great If you assume a margin for the AWS business and a margin for everything else the total profit margin only rises to Making all those heroic assumptions gets the two year forward PE down to times All of this assumes too that Amazon can indeed ramp up profits at will something Ive heard a lot of very smart people say There seems to be several schools of thought on this One is that the cloud business will grow so rapidly that it will raise the overall profit margin But as I just showed above while that could certainly raise margins it isnt enough to make the stock cheap I suppose if one looks out over a much longer time period it might be true Jeff Bezos himself has said that the cloud business will eventually surpass the retail business something I find hard to believe but hes Jeff Bezos and Im not Another idea is that Amazon can just raise prices to achieve those margins That was the predominant theme for the bulls before the cloud business came along to provide another justification for the stock price Im not sure if the people who believe this think raising prices wont affect growth the laws of supply and demand dont apply to Amazon or if they believe that Amazon has monopoly pricing power If it is the former I have to disagree If Amazon raises prices it will certainly affect their growth rate and therefore the multiple one can put on the stock If its the latter I also have to disagree If Amazon really has monopoly power someone in Washington DC is going to notice and do something about it Lastly Ive heard a number of people say that all Amazon has to do is cut back on their capital spending to ramp up earnings There are a number of problems with this line of thinking First is that capex only flows through the income statement via depreciation capex flows through the cash flow statement Reducing capex will not have an immediate and significant impact on the bottom line Second if Amazon can just turn this capex spending off at will doesnt that imply that theyve been spending on things they dont need If thats true shouldnt shareholders be upset about that right now If it isnt true wouldnt reducing capex be starving the business of necessary investment And lastly Amazons rate of investment really isnt that extraordinary even for a retailer AMZN CAPEX To Revenue TTM data by YCharts I am a big fan of Jeff Bezos and Amazon I admire Bezos willingness to invest for the long term and ignore the quarterly earnings game on Wall Street I admire his willingness to take risks that other more timid managers wont He isnt always right hes had his share of product flops but at least hes trying to innovate and compete But there is a big difference between a good company and a good stock At current prices Amazon stock doesnt appear all that attractive even when one makes some pretty generous assumptions about their profit margins In that last chart above I included <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT for a reason They also have a fast growing cloud business that sports pretty good margins In fact their profit margins are pretty good for the entire business not just the cloud part It certainly doesnt qualify for deep value status but its a lot cheaper than Amazon and you dont have to make heroic assumptions about the future to justify holding it They also happen to be investing in their future and at a higher percentage of revenue than Amazon Just sayin
