to return to its former leadership position across verticals While the email wasnt intended for the public Geekwire obtained the email in its entirety I recommend a full read as the email is interesting meaningful and if youre a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investor its impactful Three Bold Ambitions Reinvent productivity and business processes Build the intelligent cloud platform Create more personal computing Our strategy is to build bestinclass platforms and productivity services for a mobilefirst cloudfirst worldWe will realize our mission and strategy by investing in three interconnected and bold ambitions Reinvent productivity and business processes Build the intelligent cloud platform Create more personal computing So this is something that Ive been following for a while and Nadella summarized and made it a focus in his email I think its pretty obvious that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is business focused currently and feels like thats where its definitive competitive advantage lies I couldnt agree more with the company and with the strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been a hot topic in consulting circles and in the SMBenterprise solution space as of late as a direct result of the leaps and bounds forward that its solution products have taken Driving this attention and attraction has primarily been Power BI Power BI Designer the upcoming release of Surface Hub and the integrations the company has executed to build out its entire productivity suite including those with huge SMBenterprise solution names Box NYSE BOX MailChimp etc Lets not forget that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has other secondary products like OneDrive and the suite including Word Excel and PowerPoint helping further the valueprop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>becoming relevant to a new generation of users and centers of influence is huge and a highly productive longterm market cap driver Its users in and around the age group that are either going to adopt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>products or not and its these users that are going to decide the future of the company This age group the bottom at least grew up in an age of zero brand loyalty and a what have you done for me lately mentality and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has done nothing but impress them and make life easier If it can keep this up it becomes a fixture in the conversation of where to turn to when in a solution pinch If not well it stays where it is we will reinvent productivity services for digital work that span all devices We will also extend our experience footprint by building more business process experiences integrated into content authoring and consumption communication and collaboration tools We will drive scale and usage by appealing to dualuse customers providing productivity services that enable them to accomplish more at work and in the rest of their life activities with other people I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to have a unique and again clearly defined advantage over ancillary umbrella product competitors Apple NASDAQ AAPL recently takenprivate Dell etc in that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can dominate the workplace to a greater degree than any of its major competitors I really believe that I believe that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is to grow adoption of its total product portfolio take for example its mobile devices that it should leverage its business capture ability Put simply if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can familiarize users with its operating systems and platforms at work it stands a far greater chance of seeing crossover consumer adoption As the operating system translation is made less of a hurdle which I presume creates some of the adoption friction the company is experiencing currently I myself allowed this friction to cause me avoid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>products before Power BI introducing me back into the ecosystem adoption should increase Higher rates of adoption stand a better chance at creating network effects and adoption loops Of course this would be huge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>My big takeaway right out of the gate is that Nadella is focused on the right strategy That matters all these experiences will be powered by our cloud platform a cloud that provides our customers faster time to value improved agility and cost reduction and solutions that differentiate their business Well further provide a powerful extensibility model that is attractive to thirdparty developers and enterprises This in turn enables us to attract applications to our cloud platform and attach our differentiated capabilities such as identity management rich data management machine learning and advanced analytics This was interesting in that Ive commented recently that I thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wasnt going to be concerned about developing its own cloud going forward instead preferring to quasioutsource the platform and that the cloud space inclusive of anything to do with storage but also in regards to deriving value from simply havingfacilitating activities via the cloud has beenis in a race to zero and has been commoditized To hear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>intends to make this a point of focus although vaguely and Im still unsure what direction this will lead the companys efforts is a bit puzzling especially in light of how the letter to employees started Ill have to wait for specifics maybe at next earnings or in future interviews that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>management gives before I pass final judgment on this but right now Im left a bit stumped I just dont see how doing anything outside of simply hosting platforms on the cloud can work to drive value I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should continue to partner with companies like Box for cloud services and take its own expenditures and resource commitments down to minimum levels I think there are a few other ways for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to cut fat as well but those are subjects for future articles The good news about this letter is that it shows a much more streamlined much more focused leadership under Nadella than Ballmer The Ballmer regime will be forever remembered for horrible acquisitions impairments little productivity and helterskelter To see Nadella has a vision and more importantly one that makes sense is big for building confidence in the early going Its also encouraging to see Nadella willing to make tough decisions restructuring divisions and management was brave Overall Im left with a positive outlook post the letter and Im excited to see what the next few quarters hold Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>My Reaction To Satya Nadellas Employee Email Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it
