PM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation MSFT Includes AAPL SSNLF by Adam Hartung Phablets are a very hot growing market Phablets are those huge phones greater than screen size that some people carry around From almost nothing in over the last years the market has exploded The original creator of this market data Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse thinks this demonstrates cannibalization of tablet sales by phablets And this is supposedly a bad thing for Apple NASDAQ AAPL But there is another way to look at this By introducing and promoting a phablet iPhone and Galaxy S Apple and Samsung OTCSSNLF are growing users of mobile media and mobile apps As the chart shows growth in tablet sales was nothing compared to what happened when phablets came along So people who didnt buy a tablet and maybe likely wouldnt are buying phablets The market is growing faster with phablets than had they not been introduced and even if tablet sales shrink Apple and Samsung will see revenues continue growing Who wins as phablet sales grow Those who have phablet products in the market and newer versions in the works Source Kantar WorldPanel and Seeking Alpha As this chart shows the companies who dominate smartphone sales are those who make Androidbased products is Samsung and Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT missed the mobilesmartphone trend and even though it purchased Nokia NYSE NOK it has never obtained anything close to a double digit share in any market Unfortunately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>enthusiasts and investors Microsofts Windows product is focused first on laptop PC users second on hybrid products used as both a laptop and tablet third on tablets primarily the slowselling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface and in a far far trailing position smartphones As data from IDC shows Surface sales are inconsequential So the big loser from phablet cannibalization of tablets will be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Given its very small user base and the heavy losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has taken on Surface there is little revenue or cash flow to support an intense competitive effort in a shrinking market Apple and Samsung will market hard to grow as many sales as possible and likely will make the tablet products more affordable Thus one should anticipate Microsofts very small tablet share would decline as tablet sales shrink <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>missed the trend to mobile It didnt prepare for it in any of its major products and it let new products like music player Zune and Lumia phones languish and mostly die By the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reacted Apple and Samsung had enormous leads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still trying to play catchup with its core Windows product But worse because it is so far behind Microsofts leaders are unable to forecast where the market will be in years Consequently it develops products for todays market like tablets and their hybrid products which we now see will be obsolete as the market shifts to new products like phablets Because Apple and Samsung already have the new products phablets they are prepared to cannibalize the old product sales tablets in order to overall grow the marketplace But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has no phablet product really no smartphone product and will find itself most likely writing off more future Surface products as its tiny market share erodes to nothing So this trend to phablets continues to make a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>comeback as a major personal technology competitor problematic Windows may be coming but its relevance looks increasingly like that of new BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY models There is little reason to care because the products are years late and poorly positioned for leading edge customers Further developers will already be onto new competitive platforms long before the outdated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>products make it to market Without share you dont capture developers without developers you dont have a robust app market without apps you dont capture customers without customers you cant build share and thats a terrible whirlpool <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is captured within Be sure your business keeps its eyes on trends and does not wait to react Waiting can turn out to be deadly Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade
