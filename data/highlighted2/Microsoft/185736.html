#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to release the final version of Windows Mobile OS The Elephone Voyney has a quadcore Intel processor that lets it dualboot Windows Mobile and Android operating systems I wrote about Elephones dualOS smartphone last May I said it was going to have an Intel NASDAQ INTC processor WM Power User supported this assertion two weeks ago The upcoming Elephone Voyney will allegedly have a quadcore Intel processor GB of RAM Sony NYSE SNE Exmor IMX camera sensor and a K x resolution inch screen display I will repeat it again only an x processor could take full advantage of Windows s Continuum for Phones feature No Snapdragon or MediaTek processor will be able to match the Intel x chip when it comes to universal compatibility with Windows legacy software I suspect Elephone is now only waiting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to release the final version of Windows Mobile so it could do the commercial launch of the Voyney in China As of now its likely Microsofts tardiness is delaying the launch of the Intelpowered dualOS handset from Elephone Elephones wise decision to trust the Intel x architecture will definitely inspire other Chinese OEMs to follow its example Whitebox tablet manufacturers are already selling dualOS WindowsAndroid tablets with calling feature since last year Intel is now cancelling its discounts on Bay Trail Atom tablet application processors Chinese OEMs might find it prudent to shift toward making dualOS smartphonesphablets to be able to sell their products at a higher retail prices As per Digitimes supply chain informers Intel will stop giving an discount on each Bay Trail processors Intel is now only willing to offer a discount on Cherry Trail Atom tablet application processors The official US price tag of the cheapest Cherry Trail Atom x xZ is tray but even if Intel sells it for in China the very low margins on Android tablets and phones will force Chinese OEMs to differentiate their products with a dualOS feature to make it more attractive than the competition Its unclear if Intel also is stopping the discount on Bay Trail Atom chips for Android smartphones If not then Elephone and hundreds of Chinese OEMs will shift more of their production toward Intelpowered largesized smartphones There is really no need for inch tablets when there are inch phablets The discount on Bay Trail Atoms for phones is a nice incentive for Elephone and others to simply reclassify their callingenabled tablets to the smartphone category With or without the discount from Intel the Windows Mobile OS is now free from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Unlike Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now an enthusiastic supporter and it also offers subsidies for dualOS devices Making dualboot Windows Android handsets and selling them or higher than their equivalent Androidonly phones is a winwin deal for Chinese OEMs like Elephone Intels decision to cancelreduce its subsidy on tablet application processors also is one more reason for all of us to remain long on INTC Its high time that Intel lets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>do most of the contra revenue on Intelpowered dualOS phones and tablets That company has far more cash reserves than Intel has now A significant reduction on subsidy for mobile application processors might make more investors fall in love again with INTC If not for the huge operating losses on mobile chips Intel would have delivered better net income and gross revenue for the last three years I again reiterate my position that INTC is a buy for longterm valueDCFminded investors As per the chart above from Simply Wall Street Intel remains a highly profitable company with an almostmonopolistic wide moat on serverdesktop PC processors XFins year projection for the intrinsic value of INTC also is very positive in
