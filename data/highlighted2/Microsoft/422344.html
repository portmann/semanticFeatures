th Polaris based RX will be retail less than half the price of competitive products On May st AMD NASDAQ AMD made a presentation at Computex in Taipei During that presentation AMD demonstrated both of their new NM products Polaris for GPUs and Zen for CPUs These latest products place AMD right at the forefront of new lower priced VR virtual reality and desktop products This is another goodnews event following others such as the closing of the NantongFujitsu deal for million AMD Closes Nantong Fujitsu Joint Venture Now Is The Time To Buy the signing of a Chinese Joint Venture AMD The Good News Continues and two potential new game console contracts AMD New PlayStation And Xbox Consoles Should Boost Results Significantly In this article I will explain why this continuing good news is a trend and not an aberration as some would lead you to think Raja Koduri SVP and Chief Architect at Radeon Technologies Group hes pictured above explained how the new Polaris product the RX would be available on June th at a bargain price of He then went on to explain the market for Polaris products going forward As part of the presentation he brought in via video software developers from Doom They were very upbeat about Polaris potential as seen by these comments Want to play Doom on your laptop on the train home Polaris plus Vulkan is going to make that possible That was followed by Jim Anderson SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics at AMD Anderson explained the latest iterations of AMDs APU line not Zen for desktops and laptops And he brought out three representatives from large customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>HP and Dell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is interesting because they buy CPUs from both Intel NASDAQ INTC for their Surface line of laptops and from AMD for their Xbox game consoles One has to wonder will the combination of Polaris and Zen lead to some AMD sales for Surface products in the future Stay tuned HP and Dell are interesting because they already use AMD APUs and combined represent billion worth of Intels sales in per Intel K Compared to AMDs sales of less than billion that represents a significant market opportunity for AMDs Polaris and Zen products And that does not include Lenovo another AMD customer that bought billion in products from Intel It would only make sense that AMD customers using the current product line successfully would be interested in buying even more technologically superior products in the future Five percent of that billion would be a game changer for AMD Another common complaint of AMD critics is it has not announced a ship date for Zen yet They imply this means a time frame AMD actually ran a Zen desktop at Computex although admittedly it was portably cobbled together for the show However the ever conservative CEO Lisa Su made this statement We expect to sample Zen to our priority customers in a few weeks and more widely available sampling in the third quarter I am certain priority customers include the above mentioned HP Dell and Lenovo And sampling in June almost certainly means something shipping thus year Yes the volumes will probably be small but the positive PR will be very large No AMD will never have the gross margins of Intel and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA In AMDs GM was about vs Intels and Nvidias However in AMDs GM was and they made per share I think their margin will expand to the midforties range with the new products It will never be as high as the others because of their large and expanding semicustom business including game consoles But with their much lower CAPEX and OPEX AMDs margins will be able to climb back into the midforties going forward And at that rate earnings should be at least AMD continues to deliver on its promises while its critics continue to look in the rearview mirror In the past the company was often times pathetic lacking direction and incapable of delivering quality products But Lisa Su and her executive crew are now delivering on their promises and with a relentless focus are making headway in every department The latest is Radeon RX on shelf June th With predictions of being cash flow positive in the nd half billion in semicustom contracts beginning to ship next quarter new game console contracts coming and now Polaris shipping superior lowcost graphic products AMD
