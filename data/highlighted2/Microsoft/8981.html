deal However it proves the company is determined to follow its current strategy It also highlights the trouble Western companies have to go through in China According to Wall Street Journal information Yahoo is shutting down its research center in Beijing and will lay off between and employees The move wraps up its Chinese adventure which on the one hand has been widely successful and on the other hand a dismal failure Yes Yahoo proved to be an astute investor by buying percent of Alibaba NYSE BABA for billion in and realizing windfall profits later on The percent stake it still owns is now valued at billion On the other hand the deal also meant the companys China operations were taken over by Alibaba Yahoo would never regain any type of significance in China and the move to close its last office on the ground makes sense for several reasons First it fits within Yahoos strategy to focus on essentials and cut costs Yahoos CFO Ken Goldman told investors at a conference in March that the company was dedicated to saving costs The company is working very hard internally to grow revenues as well as managing expenses he said So closing an expensive and practically useless office in China and laying off a maximum of people costing at least per year on average should save the company tens of millions By moving out of China completely Yahoo also avoids getting in trouble with the Chinese regime For employees around the globe at Yahoo this is nothing new The company has been firing people a few hundreds at a time every week starting in February with the countries most affected being India and Canada As for noncore operations Yahoo will spin off the remaining percent it owns in Alibaba into a separate company at the end of the year to avoid paying taxes Analysts at Nomura believe it could also spin off its remaining stake in Yahoo Japan another noncore operation Going forward the company will focus on improving search deals with Mozilla and <span

regime which recently rolled out new stringent regulations coming into effect in March that require foreign tech companies to give up source codes and build backdoors into its products After having to settle a lawsuit with two journalists in who sued the company for handing over data to the regime resulting in the journalists serving year jail terms in China Yahoo just doesnt want to take the risk In February gamemaker Zynga Inc NASDAQ ZNGA announced the closure of its Beijing office and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is also moving manufacturing of its smartphones to Vietnam Because of dubious regulations a lack of market knowledge and monopoly protection for companies like Sina Weibo NASDAQ WB and Baidu NASDAQ BIDU most big Western tech companies havent succeeded in China although Facebook NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR are very popular with people who successfully cracked the regimes firewall Google for example pulled out of China in after the regime forced it to selfcensor and allegedly launched numerous cyberattacks against the company Other Western tech companies are increasingly becoming entangled in the CCPs factional war between current regime leader Xi Jinping and former head Jiang Zemin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a good example In the summer of Chinas antimonopoly agency raided several <span

fine for tax evasion later in Since coming to power in Xi has launched a campaign to rein in corruption but has specifically targeted allies of former party head Jiang Zemin both inside and outside China Jiang Zemin whose son Jiang Mianheng owns percent of Microsofts China business had met Bill Gates numerous times Despite the fact that percent of windows copies in China are estimated to be pirated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a foothold in the Chinese market both with software and with content However this foothold came at the price of wooing Jiang Zemin
