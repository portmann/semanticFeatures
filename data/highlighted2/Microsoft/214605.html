Apple Inc AAPL By Jason Aycock SA News Editor Apple AAPL is nearing the release of its Android app for Apple Music judging from a German mobile site that has gotten hold of screenshots and says some users are in private beta It would mark just the second time the company officially released an Android app and the other one was a tool to migrate data to iOS devices from Android devices The company had said in its June launch that an Android app for Apple Music would be coming at some point this fall On Tuesday Apple chief Tim Cook said Apple Music had M users M of which were paying subscribers billion in revenues at APRU means they have to get million subscribers They have to get million more subscribers Good luck Apples moves into recurrent revenue streams should not be overlooked Apple Music AppleCare the iPhone upgrade program and the new AppleTV AppStore are but a few ways Apple management is clearly moving to a more consistent less volatile revenue cycle IMHO this bodes well for stockholders If this is true and I hope it is its analogous to Apple crossing the line more than a decade ago with iTunes for Windows a Trojan horse dragged deep into the oppositions home base Suddenly the variouslyinterpreted solid or lacklustre Apple Music launch gets a new set of numbers I am willing to pay for a subscription based adfree streaming music service with a decent deep libraryApple music does not enchant I am audioning Tidal and will likely sign up My wife dropped on me two days ago that shes decided to subscribe to Apple Music now that her trial period is up Shes switching over from Pandora and the hook for her was the music discovery service She said the UI was kind of confusing at first but she was fine after she got used to it Gregg Im not stalking you I just happened to have finally gotten around to reading your excellent blog post and made a couple comments there But now you have me thinking about how Apple Music connects or doesnt to what you have said about the company I subscribe to Apple Music I use it I enjoy it Having said that I cant for the life of me figure out what Apple is thinking with its design of iTunes to begin with and with the new iTunes and Apple Music monster they have created currently Design at this level is not arbitrary They had some philosophy or goals in mind when they made the decisions they did But I cant for the life of me figure out what they were I once read a book that suggested the problem with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office specifically Excel was that the toolbar was developed by the marketing department and not by the users The thinking goes the toolbar and later ribbon which was even worse was designed to show off all of Offices gee whiz features and not for the person who would actually have to select among them in the course of daily productivity That made some sense to me and got me to be a lot less hostile toward the product I just gritted my teeth and invested the time to customize the thing for my workflow After that I had a lot fewer problems and was less puzzled by the whole sloppiness of the original design But I cant bring even that explanation to Apple Music and come away with any satisfaction Because I cant figure out even what gee whiz features they might be trying to show case if that were the point of the design How does this tie in with your excellent description of Apple I dont see much of the addictive reinforcement taking place because Ive been too often reduced to poking at things in blind frustration I was a hobbyist programmer for many years and I know enough about toolbar design as a developer and as user to really admire when something is where it ought to be Save me clicks or save me thinking or grab the brass ring and do both at once I love a well designed program Like we all do of course But what was iTunes and why did they go ahead an lay another blanket of fog on top of it with Apple Music I have poked around enough to learn how to get it to perform some basic functions that are the ones I need But I have no idea why I must choose the items I do and there are still things Id like to do that I havent figured out You say that software shapes the brain Well they seem to want to assume I think of music in playlists and if I dont Im pretty well out of luck The way I actually think of music is the way I was trained in my youth Select a song or album listen to it and then think of what I want to listen to next Listen to that I do like the singersongwriter channel and have discovered new music with that And that music discovery experience was what made me conclude it was worth paying for So maybe that particular experience fits with your description of Apple as selling experience But the rest of the software is to brain training as The Rack is to Yoga Hi DM Ive used iTunes and it is a monstrosity I think even Apple lovers hate it I definitely think Apples application level software is often not up to snuff in terms of experiences unlike the OSs I dont know why exactly I have led software teams and know software UI design is extremely difficult and tricky and time consuming One WAG I have is that the OS level is so important to Apple that it takes the air out of the room in terms of using all the attention of their Ateam of UX people and designers leaving the application software to be designed by the B and C teams An enlightening question about this recent product cycle Which team do you think got the best talent the iOS team the Mac OS team the Apple TV OS team the Watch OS team or the Apple Music team Companies arent monolithic and theres only so much talent and executive attention to go around in even the best company My guess is Apple Music was at the bottom of the pecking order Theres no defending several of the application level UX designs IMO This is not a new thing and goes way back I think I can guess it is probably because Jobs personally invested his time in the OS and infrastructure of the computing and didnt personally immerse himself in many of the applications being created by Apple kind of sending a message to the organization about where it was important to focus their best efforts Apple Music is independent of ecosystem and Siri The appeal is tremendous library ease of search human curation live radio and on and on At David personal taste perhaps There isnt a great deal of difference between the two in terms of function or content Its a threat to Spotify anyway you slice it I am a user of both AM and Spotify I have noticed lately that Spotify is missing a lot of the artists that I like to listen to while AM has them Theres also a segment of true music buffs who really like Beats radio which does a lot of artist interviews and music history type stuff I think part of Apples strategy is to lead with this segment with the hope that they are influencers ETF Screener Search and filter by asset class strategy
