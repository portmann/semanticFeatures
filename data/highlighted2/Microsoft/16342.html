Transformer n Windows laptop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT made the right decision to pick Cherry Mobile as its partner last year Cherry Mobile has market share in smartphone sales in the Philippines Samsung OTCSSNLF who has refused to release a new Windows phone is second with market share Cherry Mobile is now expanding its Windows initiative beyond smartphones by selling affordable gamesfriendly tablets and hybrid n notebooks March and April are the graduation season among schools colleges here in the Philippines Cherry Mobile is taking advantage of the graduation season to help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>sell more Windows tablets and hybrid n notebooks Pricing is always important when selling a product and Cherry Mobile is as good as Xiaomi when it comes to undercutting the prices of rivals The Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph is a much cheaper version of the revamped Asus OTC ASUUY Transformer T which sells for P Cherry Mobile is urging parents and relatives to gift their newly graduated kids a touchscreen Windows Alpha Morph n notebook The Alpha Morphs new promo price is just P a big discount from its original P The Asus Transformer has a much bigger storage USB and HDMI ports and higher resolution display However the cheaper Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph is always guaranteed to sell well in a pricesensitive like the Philippines This deal with Cherry Mobile is a great template that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should use in other countries Winning the support of popular local brands not OEMs like Samsung is a very effective way to propagate Windows phones tablets and computers Highschool and college students found the Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph attractive because it is capable of running DoTA and CounterStrike In spite of the low price of the Alpha Morph it is a decent portable gaming machine that plays all popular PC games on lowergraphic quality settings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been losing ground to Googles NASDAQ GOOGL Chromebooks in the US particularly in the education system However I am confident that Chromebooks will have little appeal to students in the Philippines Students and home users will likely still prefer a Windows notebook that could run <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office DoTA or League of Legends My point is that Windows PC sales to students might greatly benefit if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>starts selling a rebranded use Lumia branding Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph in the US I am sure that millions of high school and college kids in America are also addicted to DoTA and League of Legends The Alpha Morph is as cheap as Chromebooks but students cannot use their Chromebooks for League of Legends after they are done with schoolhomework Letting kids play video games is good for them Parents can save more money when they buy a cheap Windows hybrid that can also run Android apps and games The Alpha Morph can be used as an Android machine using BlueStacks This is the beauty of Windows machines they can run Android OS apps Furthermore the GB of RAM inside the cheap Alpha Morph means it can also use VirtualBox to run Chrome OS But the most important thing really is that cheap gamescapable Windows tablet hybrid products are great equalizers to the rising threat of Chromebooks and Android tablets I reiterate my position that Microsofts focus on cheap tablets smartphones and hybrid ns is an excellent way to gain advertising eyeballs The new freemium strategy of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could only be implemented by recruiting more people to use Windows computers and mobile devices Freemium made Google supersuccessful in mobile Likewise Nadella might just be able to replicate Googles success by giving away free software and selling cheap mobile gadgets Recruiting the help of successful local vendors is also a great way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to penetrate the Androidsaturated emerging markets like the Philippines The success of Cherry Mobiles Windows hybrid ns has also inspired other Filipino mobile brands to sell their own Windows PCs StarMobile has released the Engage PRO last month for P and CloudFone has also released its Epic hybrid tabletnotebook Cherry Mobile StarMobile and CloudFone had their beginnings selling Android smartphones They are now helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>realize Nadellas freemium strategy Local brands like Xiaomi and Cherry Mobile have beaten Samsung in their respective markets I say Windows s future is bright even if Samsung never releases a Windows smartphone or tablet MSFT is a Buy Like the Alpha Morph MSFT is cheaper than the competition Compared to its industry and sector peers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft
