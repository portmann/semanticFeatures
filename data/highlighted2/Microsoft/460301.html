class='textDiv'>Pokmon Go How Nintendo Beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>And Sony With An End Run Nintendo Co Ltd ADR OTCMKTSNTDOY Seeking Alpha Pokmon Go is a new sensation Just launched on July the app is already the app in the world and it isnt even available in most countries In less than weeks from a standing start Nintendos OTCPKNTDOY OTCPKNTDOF new app is more popular than both Facebook and Snapchat Based on this success Nintendos equity valuation has jumped in this same short time period Some think this is just a fad after all it is just weeks old Candy Crush came along and it seemed really popular But after initial growth its user base stalled and the valuation fell by about as growth in users time on app and income all fell short of expectations And isnt the world of gaming dominated by the likes of Sony NYSE SNE and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Nintendo launched the Wii in and it was a sensation Gamers could do things not previously possible Unit sales exceeded m unitsyear for through But Sony PS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Xbox both powered up their game consoles and started taking share from Nintendo By Nintendo sales were down to m units and in sales were off another The Wii console was losing relevance as competitors thrived Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>both invested heavily in their competition Even though both were unprofitable at the business neither was ready to concede the market In fall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>raised the competitive ante spending B to buy the maker of popular game Minecraft Nintendo was becoming a market afterthought Meanwhile back in Nintendo had of the handheld gaming market with its DS product But people started carrying the more versatile smartphones that could talk text email execute endless apps and even had a lot of games like Tetrus The market for handheld games pretty much disappeared dealing Nintendo another blow Fortunately the bitter fight to the death war between Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>kept both focused on their historical game console business Both kept investing in making the consoles more powerful with more features supporting more intense lifelike games <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>went so far as to implement in Windows the capability for games to be played on Xbox and PCs even though the PC gaming market had not grown in years These massive investments were intended to defend their installed base of users and extend the platform to attract new growth to the traditional nearly decade old market of game consoles that extends all the way back to Atari Both companies did little to address the growing market for mobile gaming The limited power of mobile devices and the small screens and poor sound systems made mobile seem like a poor platform for serious gaming While game apps did come out these were seen as extremely limited and poor quality not at all competitive to the Sony or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>products Yes theoretically Windows would make gaming possible on a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>phone But the company was not putting investment there Mobile gaming was simply not serious and not of interest to the two Goliaths slugging it out for market share Back in I recognized that the console gladiator war was not good for either big companies and recommended <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>exit the market Possibly seeing if Nintendo would take the business in order to remove the cash drain and distraction from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Fortunately for Nintendo that did not happen Nintendo observed the ongoing growth in mobile gaming While Candy Crush may have been a game ignored by serious gamers it nonetheless developed a big market of users who loved the product Clearly this demonstrated there was an underserved market for mobile gaming The mobile trend was real and its gaming needs were unmet Simultaneously Nintendo recognized the trend to social People wanted to play games with other people And if possible the game could bring people together Even people who dont know each other Rather than playing with unseen people located anywhere on the globe in a preorganized competition as console games provided why not combine the social media elements of connecting with those around you to play a game Make it both mobile and social And the basics of Pokmon Go were born Then build out the financial model Dont charge to play the game But once people are in the game charge for ingame elements to help them be more successful Just as Facebook NASDAQ FB did in its wildly successful social media game Farmville The more people enjoyed meeting other people through the game and the more they played the more they would buy inapp or ingame elements The social media aspect would keep them wanting to stay connected and the game is the tool for remaining connected So you use mobile to connect with vastly more people and draw them together then social to keep them playing and spending money Nintendo recognized that the underserved mobile gaming market is vastly larger than the overserved console market Those console gamers have ever more powerful machines but they are in some ways overserved by all that power Games do so much that many people simply dont want to take the time to learn the games or invest in playing them sitting in a home or office For many people who never became serious gaming hobbyists the learning and intensity of serious gaming simply left them with little interest But almost everyone has a mobile phone And almost everyone does some form of social media And almost everyone enjoys a good game Give them the right game built on trends to catch their attention and the number of potential customers is literally in the billions And all they have to do is download the app No expensive upfront cost not much learning and lots of fun And thus in two weeks you have millions of new users Some are traditional gamers But many are people who would never be a serious gamer they dont want a new console or new complicated game People of all ages and backgrounds could become immediate customers David can beat Goliath if you use trends In the Biblical story smallish David beat the giant Goliath by using a sling His new technology allowed him to compete from far enough away that Goliath couldnt reach David And Davids tool allowed for delivering a fatal blow without ever touching the giant The trend toward using tools for hunting and fighting allowed the younger smaller competitor to beat the incumbent giant In business trends are just as important Any competitor can study trends see what people want and then expand their thinking to discover a new way to compete Nintendo lost the console war and there was little value in spending vast sums to compete with Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>toetotoe Nintendo saw the mobile game market disintegrate as smartphones emerged It could have become a footnote in history But instead Nintendos leaders built on trends to deliver a product that filled an unmet need a game that was mobile and social By meeting that need Nintendo has avoided direct competition and found a way to dramatically grow its revenues This is a story about how any competitor can succeed if they learn how to leverage trends to bring out new products for underserved customers and avoid costly gladiator competition
