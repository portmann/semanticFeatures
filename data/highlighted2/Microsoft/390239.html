more Chinese citizens connect to the Internet and ecommerce continues its rise Beijing is reacting to reassert control Last week China shut down iTunes Movies and iBooks shocking many investors While Apple NASDAQ AAPL has in the past managed to avoid the Beijings caprice this latest development shows that Apple is not immune to the hazards of doing business in China While CEO Tim Cook has pledged to increase investment in China recent events along with slowing growth in China come at a bad time for Apple The company is already facing slower iPhone sales for example To add to Apples woes the service shutdown came just a few days before the company released its Q earnings Last week Apple stock was heading towards until news from China saw it hit a low of before closing the week at This was a largest share price drop since January As more and more Chinese citizens connect to the Internet and ecommerce continues its rise Beijing is reacting to reassert control China has created the worlds largest and most sophisticated digital censorship system colloquially named the Great Firewall of China While this system does an effective job of preventing blacklisted content entering China Beijing has come to realize that it also needs a firm hand on the hardware which enables access in the first place In Edward Snowden scared Beijing into further insulating its netizens and digital sphere from the larger world internet By the following year Chinas top leadership notably Xi Jinping began pushing the term internet sovereignty an idea that encompasses a selfcontained digital landscape for China Specifically this means the promotion of Chinese alternatives to globalized services such as Facebook NASDAQ FB and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL as well as housing Chinese data on Chinese servers Since the Snowden revelations China has identified eight American companies which it considers too deeply entrenched in the militaryindustrialsecurity complex to operate freely These companies which include the likes of IBM NYSE IBM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO have seen investigations fines and raids on their Chinese operations Moreover Beijing has forced them to sell off holdings and work with local partners in order to expand their businesses in China Apple has been able to survive and grow in China because it has met Chinese requirements including partnering with China Mobile the countrys largest service provider in to sell its iPhones Similarly Apple partnered with Union Pay Chinas statebacked bank card provider to launch Apple Pay Partnering with Apple allowed greater state influence in a sector that was being dominated by Alibaba and other homegrown companies Interestingly in Beijing asked Apple for its source codes in order to improve security Apple refused and was allowed to continue operating In the last months Chinas leadership has increasingly promoted internet sovereignty with Xi Jinping leading a committee streamlining Chinas technology and internet policy One element of this effort is the promotion of Chinese firms over foreign rivals Beijing is aware that while ecommerce and tech spending is shifting the country in the desired direction ie towards a consumption based model the government cannot tolerate a situation in which it is vulnerable to backdoors in foreign tech Apple is currently the third largest phone manufacturer in China controlling some of the market China is seeking to promote domestic firms such as Huawei and Xiaomi each with around of the market One can see the tide turning when in Qualcomm the worlds largest semiconductor manufacturer paid a million fine in an antitrust lawsuit which also saw the company pledge to sell goods to Chinese companies at lower prices Using the spectre of security Beijing is bolstering domestic firms in order to retain control In the case of Apple one can see parallels with the problems faced by Uber Private UBER in when its offices in China were raided Uber had incited mass taxi protests thus unwittingly brushing up against Chinas national stability framework Ubers disruptive power outweighed its economic benefits especially as it would directly compete against state regulated transport firms enjoying massive market share Apple has also run afoul of Chinas domestic security apparatus as the company did not adequately prepare for new regulations released in March These rules forbid foreign ownership of online publishing services and mandate that all content shown to Chinese netizens be hosted on Chinese servers Apple is the victim of bad timing not a crackdown Six months ago Apple was in the clear having received permission to launch iTunes Movies and iBooks yet given that China is not overly forthcoming regarding policy changes Apple has since paid the price Gartner analyst Brian Blau explains that there is a bit of a catandmouse game between the tech and content providers and whats acceptable and not acceptable in China The regulations came into effect in March yet Apple services were only interrupted a month later ample time in Beijings eyes for Apple to have adjusted to the new rules By disabling Apples services Beijing can demonstrate that it is serious about the direction it is taking the country in Furthermore Apples image as an untouchable poster child makes the message Beijing is sending even clearer while not overly affecting Apples operations which can rely on its brand hardware and iOS ecosystem to continue to attract customers in the shortterm Lastly Beijing is able to deflect any fallout towards Apple as annoyed customers choke customer service lines Plus if angry customers switch to Chinese companies it is no skin off Beijings back indeed iTunes Movies and iBooks compete with similar Chinese services The aforementioned months interlude portrays the government as merely implementing the law acting as defender of Chinese law against noncompliant Westerners Apple has also been hit by the fallout of international events Firstly the Panama Papers have brought highranking Chinese leaders and their families into the spotlight thus highlighting the dangers of storing Chinese data overseas This likely further galvanized the government to push forward with its new internet regulations Secondly China is keenly aware of the recent efforts by the FBI to hack iPhones belonging to the San Bernardino attackers The eventual success of this effort unfortunately puts the spotlight on smart phones and Apple in particular Recall Apples refusal to share code with China after San Bernardino and Apples service shutdown the company is less able to refuse Beijing This is especially true given that Chinese lawyers are pointing out that Chinese law requires companies to help with decryption when police or state security agents demand it for investigating or preventing terrorist acts Given that espousing a range of views counter to Beijings talking points from religion territorial integrity and governance constitutes terrorism in the eyes of the CCP Apple faces a difficult situation If Beijing can domesticate Chinas entire digital ecosystem from hardware to software to services it will wield immense control Ruffling the feathers of the likes of Apple is a small price to pay as China can leverage its economic clout to ensure it does not lose investor confidence Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Personal Computers </div></body></html>
