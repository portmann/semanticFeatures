prosper over the longhaul Steve Jobs said of the first generation iPad in iPad is our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price Two years later Apple NASDAQ AAPL posted blowout earnings in part because it sold million iPads during the quarter Unfortunately this magical device has apparently lost its touch Just last quarter Apple reported selling million iPads up less than versus three years ago Apples next big thing from is on the verge of going the way of the iPod That being said there are several changes Apple can make to reinvigorate its tablet lineup but time is running short According to research firm Gartner the collapse of the tablet market in was alarming After doubledigit growth from to Gartner is predicting the tablet market will only grow by in Unfortunately Apples iPad sales arent growing they are shrinking fast In the last quarter Apple reported unit sales declined and average revenue per unit fell by more than Apples first mover advantage helped the company tremendously but that advantage seems to have come to an end Based on operating systems Gartner expects worldwide devices running Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android OS to grow by nearly in By comparison iOSMac and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Windows are expected to post growth of less than That being said appears to be a year of separation Android is still expected to run ahead of the pack but Windows is slated to grow devices by compared to a growth rate from iOSMac The idea that Windows could overtake iOSMac when it comes to growth is a clear sign that the iPad lineup needs significant changes Before revamping the iPad Apple must address a bigger issue In the technology industry its difficult to thrive over the longhaul without a serious commitment to research and development According to research by the Bureau of Economic Analysis In years of increasing economic growth RD investment usually contributes to that acceleration Similarly when economic growth slows RD often contributes to the slowdown In short companies that spend an increased amount on RD contribute to economic growth and thus earnings growth With that in mind over the last few years Apples RD budget as a percentage of its revenue has lagged it competition significantly In the current quarter Apple spent just of its revenue on RD By comparison Google spent and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>spent nearly The fact that a product introduced almost eight years ago iPhone generates the majority of Apples revenue and profits suggests finding the next big thing is harder than the company wants to admit There are at least three distinct changes Apple can make to revive iPad sales To be fair iOS is a step in the right direction but only a half a step If we look at some of the most popular tablets they have one thing in commonmultitasking The Google Nexus is priced at less than the iPad Air and has fast multitasking The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface is priced the same as the iPad Air and can multitask sidebyside In iOS you can sidebyside multitask but only on the iPad Air Making true sidebyside multitasking only available on the companys newest and most expensive tablet is a missed opportunity The issue is true multitasking across at least the last two models of iPad Air and iPad Mini would give users of older iPads a reason to upgrade at a more reasonable cost The second issue is iCloud related Five gigabytes of free storage to sync all devices is simply not enough Google gives users GB of Google Drive storage for free The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface includes a years worth of Office and its TB of OneDrive storage Last but not least Apple needs to push the design envelope While newer iPad models have gotten thinner and lighter than prior versions this is no longer enough Apple should have learned this lesson from the iPhone By releasing the iPhone and the company unleashed pentup demand for larger screen phones The iPad Air s screen seems a hair too small to become a laptop replacement The fact that the Macbook Air goes down to suggests this is the smallest comfortable screen for a fullfledged laptop The Surface s screen of reaffirms this is the laptop replacement size Apple needs to take the bold step of allowing a larger screen iPad iPad Pro to cannibalize the Macbook Airs sales The company has consistently priced its wares at a premium so a iPad Pro would seem to be the sweet spot for this inbetween device Googles Nexus and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface both have keyboard options If Apple wants to take full advantage of the iOS multitasking capabilities a slightly bigger screen and an Apple designed keyboard would be a natural fit The bottom line is Apple seems focused on the iPhone and the Apple Watch but the iPad still represents almost of the companys sales Its time for Apple to reimagine the magical iPad experience once again If the company keeps pumping out thinner and lighter Android and Windows will continue to take market share and thats something Steve Jobs would never have tolerated Source Apples iPad Problem And How To Solve It Disclosure The author is long AAPL MSFT MoreThe
