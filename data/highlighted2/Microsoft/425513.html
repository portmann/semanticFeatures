in the field official What are the companys goals with the stake Does the transaction point to the rumored Apple car Transportation is the next big thing in technology A week almost doesnt go by without a major announcement regarding a new electric vehicle selfdriving technology or ridesharing investment The industry is on the cusp of a massive change driven by technology and no one wants to be left behind whether you are a traditional auto maker from Detroit Silicon Valley blue chip or ecommerce giant from China Apple NASDAQ AAPL is not an exception with its rumored Project Titan electric vehicle being widely considered the worstkept secret in Silicon Valley The companys involvement in the auto business would make much sense Apple looks at entering new industries to innovate and remain relevant the ultimate success for a technology company while its unparalleled balance sheet core competency in designing innovative products and decades of experience building physical objects at a massive scale would put the company in a strong strategic position to redefine the car After many Apple car rumors leaks and clues the companys recent billion investment in Didi Chuxing Private DIDI a Chinese ridesharing company makes Apples interest in the rapidly changing transportation industry official This is a big deal for the former Apple Computer Inc and todays iPhone company But what are Apples goals with the stake in Didi Does the transaction point to the rumored car Or is this simply a metoo investment following other technology companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and its stake in Uber Private UBER to take part in the growing ridesharing market We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market Some analysts suggest that Apples primary motive for the investment is to strengthen its services narrative andor improve its relationship with the Chinese government after the forced shutdown of Apples iBooks and iTunes Movies stores I disagree I think billion would hardly move a needle in both areas Instead the best way to look at the transaction is in the context of Apples traditional product focus The companys MA history shows that Apple doesnt buy companies just for the sake of additional revenue or to play politics Each of its acquisitions has a clear goal in strengthening a current or upcoming Apple product or service Lets explore the options that the company has in this respect Current service Didis ridesharing service uses machine learning as its critical component to predict and match demand for rides with a supply of cars Apples Siri voice assistant could benefit from improved machine learning However it could be argued that Apple has more experience in the field and while buying a stake in a company might grant Apple access to its technology it would not give it control and ownership Apples preferred way to deal with core technology for its products Upcoming service Apple wants to launch its own ridesharing service and wants to learn about the business first While this would be theoretically possible in reality it would be extremely costly and difficult to build scale this late in the game Apple would have to heavily incentivize drivers and customers to use a new service with very few cars long waiting times and very few users limited income for drivers For a perspective Uber currently loses B per year in China to take market share from Didi controls of the market Upcoming product Apple as a primarily product company and Didi as a service company want to complement each other in the transportation business This is a partnership similar to those between Apple and IBM NYSE IBM Cisco NASDAQ CSCO where Apple complements its hardware with partners software and services I think this is the most likely scenario Lets discuss it in more detail Didi and its ridesharing partners Ola India Grab Southeast Asia and Lyft US are involved in a fierce market battle with Uber The best technology and product will go a long way to achieve and maintain market dominance What Didi precisely needs Better Machine learning Machine learning is crucial to the companys success Didi collects over TB of data per day As per Ubers Travis Kalanick If you can predict where demand is going to be and you can get the supply to match to that thats a big freaking deal Selfdriving cars Uber has recently started testing its own selfdriving cars and Didi needs to respond The selfdriving technology is crucial for the future of the ridesharing business as it will help expand the market by lowering fares and increasing the number of cars in the network With full level autonomy it will no longer be needed to search for and incentivize new drivers Apple can provide Didi with all of that having billions of cash in China no need to repatriate it with a hefty tax experience with machine learning for Siri and offering Apple Maps and Apple Pay services Most importantly a uniquely designed Applebranded electric vehicle would provide added value for Didis global ridesharing network and differentiate it from Uber Didi and its partners are present in some of the most important markets covering almost a half of the worlds population Consider that Didi Chuxing now records million rides per day in China but this is still just a drop in the bucket given the potential of the densely populated urban areas in Asia Didis global ridesharing network could present a unique sales channel compensating for Apples lack of car dealerships Neil Cybart a top Apple analyst from Above Avalon sees Apples investment in Didi similar to the companys initial partnership with ATT NYSE T for the launch of the first iPhone At that time ATT was looking for differentiation and new revenue streams while Apple needed to learn about the telecommunications industry and looked for a distribution partner Apples investment with Didi likely marks the early stages of Apples entry into the automotive business Apple however needs to hurry up Competition will be very intense in when the company is rumored to launch its EV Tesla NASDAQ TSLA plans to launch its Model way before then in just about months and hints at selfdriving capabilities This might worry Apple as similar to ridesharing those who get to the selfdriving market early and build scale will benefit The more selfdriving cars you can get on the road the more data you collect and the better their autonomous capability On the other hand some of the core technologies for electric vehicles like batteries still need to mature to allow for a massmarket driving range while legislation needs to catch up with the rapidly evolving technology At the end of the day Apple will likely rely on what it has always worked so well for the company its not important to be the first but the best and not too late Apples partnership with Didi Chuxing marks the companys official entry into the transportation business Given Apples historic product focus the dynamics of the ridesharing industry and the ways Apple can complement Didis services with a physical product I think the investment may actually mean the beginning of the companys automotive era Apples involvement in new industries shows that the company doesnt want to rely on its iPhone business and wants to innovate and remain relevant This makes me confident that Apple has a bright future and shareholders with a longterm horizon will be rewarded
