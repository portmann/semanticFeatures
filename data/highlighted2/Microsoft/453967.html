style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has had a strong but up and down investment history This article asks the question how much should you pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The history of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is what I like to refer to as an extreme ebb and flow example Investor returns have been quite impressive over the years but this hasnt always developed in a nice linear fashion Here Ill show you what I mean Share price appreciation tends to more or less follow business performance over the longterm but there can be long spurts where a true disconnect occurs Leading up to the tech bubble <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the business was growing exceptionally fast and yet the share price grew at an even quicker annual rate This set up a couple of periods of underperformance to come It wasnt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the business was now doing poorly or making less money it was just that the previous valuation had gotten so high From through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grew per share earnings by nearly per annum and yet investors saw a significant reduction in the price that others were willing to pay for this stake during this time This sort of thing carried on for years From through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grew exceptionally well for such a large company and yet the net result on the shareholder front was basically keeping par with inflation In turn this lead to the opposite effect more recently sort of a reverse tech bubble situation Shares went from a sky high valuation to start the century all the way back down to reasonable and then further fell to near times earnings a decade later In the last few years profits have begun to stagnant and yet investor returns have been very solid as a result of the snap back in valuation From through companywide earnings grew by about annually and earningspershare increased by over per year And investors saw total returns on the magnitude of annually This is more or less what you might expect investment results tracking business gains Yet in viewing the periods above its clear that this was not a yeain yearout constant process Instead years of stagnation were followed by exceptional returns and the relationship between business results and share price bids was not always a close one So when youre thinking about valuing a business I think this sort of thing is important to keep in mind You might be right about the business performance but that in no way guarantees the investment will cooperate as you believe it should Over the longterm things generally work out but in shorter time periods even years theres no set mechanism that forces XYZ to trade exactly at times earnings or something of the sort With that in mind lets try to think about how much you might be willing to pay for shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Ideally Id prefer to think in decades but for this demonstration a fiveyear span will suffice Last fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>earned per share and the company is in the process of paying out its fourth straight quarterly dividend Depending on where you look Ive seen intermediateterm growth rate estimates ranging from to Lets use as our guide to stay a bit conservative If earningspershare were to grow by per year you might anticipate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will be generating or so during the next half decade Over the past decade Microsofts average historical earnings multiple has been in the midteens which seems reasonable given that growth expectation and a very large firm generating billions in profits If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>earned per share and traded at say times earnings this would equate to a future share price of about In addition should the dividend increase in line with earnings you would also anticipate collecting or so in cash payments Your total anticipated value for one share of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be around or thereabouts Of course this value would be in the future Next you would have to discount that value back to today depending on your required return in comparison to your applicable alternatives Naturally youd like for your potential return to be as high as possible but being realistic is also part of the process With an annual discount rate you come to a price today of roughly As were about to see this is merely a baseline but thats how you could begin to think about how much to pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>This is a crucial first step in my view Im going to let you in on interesting tidbit Ive written half an article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>leading up to this very point and I have no idea what the current share price is I did this intentionally To look up some of the information I detailed finance websites will obviously display the current share price quotation Knowing this I physically put my hand over that portion and only looked at the numbers I needed to in order to illustrate the above information to you Other than having a rough idea of hundreds of businesses and a historical reference I still dont know the share price So why did I purposely do that Thats easy I didnt want to become anchored to the going rate as I tried to come up with a reasonable price to pay The share price is the first thing that most people see And once you see it you cant forget it It becomes anchored to your mind and everything that you do thereafter will be influenced by where shares are currently trading hands at this very moment If the share price were much higher than your estimation its reconsider well the company is incredibly profitable and growing perhaps the market is right shares ought to trade at or times earnings Conversely should the going rate be much lower than your estimate you might talk yourself into a lower multiple or more dismal expectations To be sure there is a whole lot more to valuation then what I demonstrated above but the psychological aspect is very real Anchoring yourself to current or past share prices can have lingering effects on how you go about the investing world Considering the current share price first is a surefire way to follow the crowd but not necessarily an easy path to finding investment success So lets continue with this example The share price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as I write this wait for me to go check is This single observation after first contemplating the investment without bias allows us to think about the investment in a variety of different ways First we can make the easy comparison the above baseline presumes a fair price near whereas the actual price is closer to A simple view would highlight that shares are trading above what you might consider reasonable Of course its paramount to remember that this is not an absolute When you starting working through a valuation process youre going to get a very specific number say Yet this is certainly not to suggest that is fair and that would be no good For that matter this does not indicate that or or cannot build wealth The idea is simply to first develop a baseline without bias The next step is to acknowledge just how finicky the process can be In the above demonstration I used a discount rate of When you put that into a spreadsheet it becomes absolute Yet really I just picked that number out of the air why not or or or Based on that information you could argue that a fair price to pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in keeping with the above assumptions is somewhere between and today Of course this situation also highlights a secondary consideration just like the discount rate is up for debate so too are your assumptions Once you model a growth rate or PE ratio it appears cemented but you have to be cognizant of the idea that what happens in practice can and likely will vary greatly While I created a wide range of fair values by changing the discount rate there are many more variants at play Instead of changing the discount rate well leave that at for the below illustration heres how you could think about varying earnings multiples and future growth rates This table uses future growth rates ranging from to per year on the top row along with future PE ratios ranging from to down the first column Obviously something beyond these bounds is possible but I would contend that the above table covers a good deal of what would presently be anticipated The values at each intersection represent the current price that would be required in order to generate a return of per annum including dividends So in keeping with our example if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>were to grow earnings by annually and trade at times earnings you would need a share price today of around to generate an yearly return This table gives a very wide range anywhere from to as a fair price to pay And remember this is only using one discount rate You could further break out the possibilities based on varying discount rates as well Yet the takeaway is a bit simpler than that The idea is that while you are going to come up with a very specific number as your baseline thats all it is a baseline You have to be aware of the moving variables at play In turn personally I view this information as a reinforcement as to why youd be inclined to bake in conservative rather than cheery estimates in your calculations You want to do alright even if things dont go swimmingly By the way this exact idea is highlighted when you see something like Morningstars fair value estimate The analyst there spends a great deal of time thinking about the business and security and comes up with a fair value I just checked for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and currently is listed But then theres an acknowledgement of just how finicky the process can be providing a range of consider buy and consider sell of between and People like specifics Theyre easy to understand You think XYZ is worth it trades at so it must be good Yet its equally important to acknowledge the limitations involved People dont like seeing that something might be worth between and using Morningstar or between and using the numbers depicted above Yet its a much better answer Youre dealing with unknowns and guesses about the future no need to be precisely wrong Incidentally this could be classified under the Ben Graham fat test whereby you dont need to know a mans exact weight to opine that he ought to lose or gain some pounds Its the same reason that I believe its ludicrous to make a buy or sell decision based on a slightly higher or lower price in comparison to your estimated value So how much should you pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>This wont be a satisfying conclusion but it depends greatly on your expectations about the business how strongly you feel about those estimates and the returns that could be had with your applicable alternatives And applicable is an important side note if something is out of your range of understanding that doesnt count as an alternative The above illustration is how Id start to think about what I might be willing to pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>First Id look at things on a high level without bias in this case specifically that meant coming up with a fair price and then looking at the share price not the other way around Next you want to look on a deeper level which was not depicted here but relates to whether or not an investment is even in your area of consideration Thereafter its important to acknowledge the wide range of potential outcomes and determine on a psychological level whether that is acceptable Luckily the investing world is filled with many more positive wealthcreating opportunities than negative ones so the process becomes more enjoyable as you move along
