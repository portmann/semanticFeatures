Intels presence in mobile recently Im dedicating this article to clear up these misconceptions because in reality Intel has done a lot of corporate and product maneuvering to get in the right product segments Furthermore I cant comprehend how Intel is actually losing money Cost segmentation of fabrelated costs are being distributed into a lowrevenue segment but those costs would have existed even without mobile Furthermore the ASPs from the highend of the tablet market are extremely compelling and with the recent form factor changes to inch and up it positions INTC where its strongest Theres also enough evidence to indicate that mobiletablets are starting to become accretive to consolidated margins and revenue Surface volumes are ramping whereas Apple is struggling so whos losing For the most part I believe the argument over Intels NASDAQ INTC nearterm mobile profitability to be misconstrued by other members of this website Its more the gimmicky nature of accounting as opposed to money loss from the segment that seems to be tripping everyone over the current fiscal year as opposed to next fiscal year Furthermore no one can offer enough compelling evidence to support the notion that theyre actually losing money on a consolidated operating basis from mobile Sure we could argue that Intels net income hasnt grown over the past couple years but that has more to do with desktop and laptop weakness This issue though becomes addressed as a result of their efforts in mobile and tablets next year as opposed to issues with their mobile PL When you work downwards into the consolidated impact the mobile group seems to be a contributor this year despite the carry over of ongoing RD pertaining to nextgeneration process nodes These costs pertaining to fabspecific operating costs would have existed whether they had actually participated in mobile or not However when you do the segmentbysegment reporting they have to distribute these ancillary costs into a segment that doesnt generate server or desktoplaptoplike revenues Also the incremental cost of developing mobilespecific designs is dropping and while those costs are a small component of the companys operating cost structure the incremental impact from reducing those costs generates meaningful operating profit improvements for the upcoming fiscal year The topic of MCG profitability was a bigger theme in last years investor conference because the company was losing money just by spreading the cost of foundational foundry investments on a segmentbysegment basis but in terms of actual economic profit or in terms of accounting consolidated profit the MCG is starting to pull more of its own weight This is partially because of RD reductions in the lowpower envelopes but more specifically improvements to the gross margin per wafer on the mobilespecific SKUs Furthermore while Intel wont generate a substantial improvement to their market share growth seems feasible based on their ability to release new mobile parts on an annual cadence and the offsetting of direct RD by moving over SoC design at the lowend to thirdparties like Rockchip and Spreadtrum Of course this doesnt completely mitigate direct RD expenditure into the lower power envelopes because Intel continues to invest into the development of mobile modems and Atomclass CPUs So theyve kept the good stuff and still participate in the not so good stuff Intel has done some pretty good corporate level maneuvering to avoid the lowmargin categories of the mobile segment by simply moving the costs of developing these chips over to Chinese semiconductor houses They then go on to provide the foundational architecture so companies can develop some compelling designs using Intelbased architecture Over the past couple years weve seen a consistent trend in Intel gaining market share And while the tablet segment has been an area of concern I think investors forget they actually have a meaningful presence in the tablet market via the Surface Pro lineup which is generally recognized interms of Useries sales which doesnt fall under MCG but rather the broader revenue pool of CCG After consolidating MCG and PCCG its all synonymous anyway In other words its not that Intel hasnt generated progress in tablets its just that in the lowend theyre not doing so hot due to tabletmarket decline even as theyre generating meaningful momentum in highend tablet sockets In a sense thats where they exhibit the most strength and its where OEMs feel comfortable in terms of tablet differentiation away from ARMcores After all Intels process and design advantage is best exemplified once we move into the W TDP variants of its processor family and as such these tablets are worth taking a closer look into because the Core i and i lineup for Surface Pro and Surface book typically carry ASPs in excess of at the entry level As such Intel can technically occupy a meaningful fragment of the ultra highend of the tablet market and come much further ahead than attempting to compete with Qualcomm in mainstream tablets where app processors are sold for less than per unit Furthermore Intels tablet strategy seems to be working where it matters most in the highend as evidenced by Microsofts sales growth in the segment between FY and FY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grew the Surface segment by in FY and reviews for the Surface Pro were all around solid despite the difficulty of repairing the product Intel has a much bigger advantage in terms of performance and power consumption at W TDPs This runs contrary to logic but because tablets have followed a similar trend to smartphones were seeing a blurring of the lines between tablets and laptops In a sense a tablet replacement of laptops creates cannibalization and its this strategic shift that has been creating some friction in Intels SkylakeH lineup which has TDPs in excess of W but is targeted at performanceoriented notebooks like the MacBook Pro inch or the XPS lineup from Dell This market is sort of in transition but it seems overall accretive to Intel because they can still participate in tablets without completely alienating its core laptop business Theyre just moving up the power stack where they and the OEMs feel most comfortable In other words the bigger tablet variants play straight into Intels hands because thats where Intel knows it can compete with Apples NASDAQ AAPL custom designs and still come ahead with very healthy margins Big tablets have a form factor similar to laptops so battery life becomes less of an issue because you can simply package a larger battery to overcome the powerperformance dynamics Hence this is an area where not even Samsung OTCSSNLF or Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM can realistically compete as such it would be a stretch to label Intel a mobile disaster Theres still power behind the Wintel ecosystem and while things have been shaken up in the past its common knowledge that Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are well capitalized and know how to adapt to a heightened competitive environment Dont forget that it was Wintel the alliance that subjugated the PC market away from IBM NYSE IBM and Apple in the s While Apple does have a functional tablet at the highend so does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel It also comes with better performance parameters Apple is trying to maintain sales growth off a high revenue base whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel are creating marginal revenue from thin air The organic growth argument seems far more compelling in the case of Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>than in the case of Apple As such I dont view Intels mobile business the way others have painted it Theyre not actually losing money from mobile and theyre making headway into the highest margin segment Explain to me how do you lose money from a segment thats generating higher operational profits in an environment where they anticipate a midsingle digit PC shipment decline Its all because of their highend tablet strategy costsynergies through partnerships in lowend mobile and incremental loss aversion from mainstream tabletssmartphones Quite frankly the strategy is so good its going to generate sales growth in a year where conventional laptoptower shipments may either decline or remain flat I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy recommendation and price target Editors Note This article discusses
