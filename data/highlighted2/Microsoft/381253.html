TWTR YAHOY This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at reports indicating Yahoo has far fewer serious bidders than past reports have suggested A silver lining Both reports still indicate Verizons interest in buying Yahoo is quite legitimate Tim Armstrong the head of Verizons AOL unit wants to build an online ad giant And Verizon is increasingly turning to online media to offset telecom revenue pressures Though media reports have indicated there could be up to firms looking to buy Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO core business Fortune reports there will be less than ten firstround offers as of Mondays deadline and that most of those will be viewed by Yahoos board as wildly insufficient particularly if Yahoo is actually looking for a B sale price as has been reported Fortune adds in spite of reports of SoftBanks OTCPKSFTBF interest and the logic of SoftBank wanting to buy Yahoos Alibaba NYSE BABA and Yahoo Japan OTCPKYAHOY stakes to add to its existing stakes in the companies SoftBank hasnt signed an NDA and doesnt plan to make an offer It also states <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT reportedly willing to provide financing to a Yahoo bidder hasnt signed an NDA either and is instead waiting to see how things unfold On top of all that Fortune reports those actually interested in Yahoo are often quite unhappy with the sale process with one PE exec calling it a f joke Few suitors have been given a chance to talk to management Verizon NYSE VZ InterActiveCorp NASDAQ IAC and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA are among the exceptions and those that have struggled to obtain info One bidder offers a cynical take Management is dragging it out to make it as difficult as possible for activist Starboard Value Yahoo will have made an effort and talked to all these buyers Theyll say they ran this process for four months and no one was interested The NYT is providing its own dose of cold water It joins Fortune in reporting Yahoo is reluctant to share business details including projections and states SoftBank and several other firms linked at some point to Yahoo including ATT NYSE T CBS Silver Lake and KKR are unlikely to bid Neither unsurprisingly is Google GOOG GOOGL which in spite of a WSJ report mentioning buyout interest is said to be worried about antitrust scrutiny Recode previously reported Google Facebook NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR had each taken a look at Yahoo perhaps with the hopes of getting a peek at a rivals books but werent likely to bid Theres one big silver lining in the midst of all this Both Fortune and the NYT state Verizons interest in Yahoo is quite real Fortune reports everyone agrees Verizon is a very interested frontrunner to acquire Yahoo The NYT says Big Red plans to press forward with a bid in spite of Yahoo managements behavior during the sale process If youre wondering why Verizon seems intent on bidding for a company whose top and bottom lines have been steadily declining revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs is expected to total BB down from B in and B in a recent WSJ column on Verizons recentlyacquired AOL unit helps explain it AOL chief Tim Armstrong is with the help of Verizons resources and consumer data bent on significantly growing AOLs scale and thus making it a credible rival to online ad giants Google and Facebook Armstrong reportedly told advertisers he wants AOL to be the worlds top mobile media company by one that reaches B users up from a current M and produces BB in sales For comparison AOL was estimated by New Street Research to produce revenue of B Buying Yahoo expected GAAP revenue of BB would go a long way towards helping Armstrong reach his goal Since its sale to Verizon AOL has bought struggling mobile ad network owner Millennial Media for M As for why Verizon suddenly wants to be an online media giant the companys Q report provides some insight In spite of the AOL deal Verizons total service and other revenue everything besides wireless equipment which is sold at a loss fell YY in to B Wireless service revenue fell it was up a modest if one factors hardware installment plan billings thanks to high US mobile penetration rates and tough lowend price competition from TMobile NASDAQ TMUS Wireline revenue fell as landline disconnections and business service weakness offset FiOS growth Clearly Verizon needs a new growth engine Beyond all of that theres a clear opportunity for a company that already has substantial online mediaadvertising operations such as VerizonAOL to improve Yahoos bottom line via cost cuts SunTrust recently estimated Verizon could cut of Yahoos staff by eliminating Yahoos GA spend and eliminating duplicate salesmarketing and RD functions The firm thinks such a move would boost Yahoos value to Verizon by B Of course even then SunTrust only values Yahoos core operations at B which is B less than what management is reportedly asking for in a sale at least as an opening offer It takes two to tango and theres no guarantee Yahoo will agree to a sale price that satisfies Verizons brass But all signs point to Verizon unlike many of the other names thrown around during Yahoos MA soap opera
