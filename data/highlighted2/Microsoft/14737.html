</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts upcoming Windows mobile initiative could get a significant boost from Lenovos support China Mobile will offer the Lenovo Windows smartphone to its subscribers Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT deal with Xiaomi is already very impressive However another very important development is that the worlds top vendor of computers Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY has committed itself to deliver a Windows smartphone in China this coming summer Carrier support is very important to the success of any new phone and the first Lenovo Windows will also come with the backing of China Mobile NYSE CHL A Xiaomibranded Windows smartphone is great but the backing of Chinas biggest carrier in China could also improve Windows phones insignificant share in that country China is the worlds largest market for smartphones The Windows mobile initiative will not be complete without a serious improvement in sales of Windows phones in the Middle Kingdom If we use China Internet Watchs million estimate of Q smartphones sales in China there were only around k units of Windows phones that got sold in China This weak sales performance in China might be the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now aggressively focusing on rockbottom Windows phone models like the Lumia China like other emerging markets is dominated by sub Android phones Engaging in a price war is an easy way to attract the attention of pricesensitive customers However while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can match the pricing war of any Android OEMs dropping the Nokia branding makes it more difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to win the attention of Chinese smartphone buyers The Nokia brand still has lingering appeal in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a brand never known for making bestselling phones therefore needs the Xiaomi and Lenovo brands to improve its business in China Windows phone is the sick man of Chinas smartphone industry Xiaomi and Lenovo are the No and No smartphone brands in China These two Samaritans could save and help Microsofts Windows get immediate connection with Chinas million smartphone users The no vendor in China Huawei has made it clear that it is not going to come out with any new Windows phones However the chart above shows that Xiaomi and Lenovo have enough clout between them to possibly sell tens of millions of sub Windows smartphones Microsofts eagerness to sell Lumia phones is similar to what made Lenovo successful Lenovo is also an enthusiastic vendor of sub smartphones Likewise Xiaomi is allegedly planning to release a entrylevel smartphone to cater to the stingiest of customers Xiaomis original budget phone was the RedMi which currently sells for around in China and India Outside of Asia the Lenovo brand is not as famous as Samsung OTC SSNLF when it comes to smartphones However Lenovo has been the worlds no vendor of smartphones since Now that Lenovo owns the Motorola smartphone brand there is a chance that a Motorola Windows will also be released for the AmericanEuropean markets Lenovos smartphone revenue is now derived from outside China The Motorola brand is also still strong with million smartphones shipped out during Q Motorola is another brand that could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>increase the global penetration of Windows phones Winning the support of Chinas two most prolific smartphone vendors further affirms my longterm buy recommendation for MSFT The combined might of Lenovo and Xiaomi could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gain more market share in Chinas massive smartphone industry China Mobiles support for the upcoming Lenovo Windows handset is also very important Microsofts search and mobile advertising services requires Windows mobile devices to be always online Postpaid subscribers are highly desirable because they get free or cheap data allocation with their China Mobile Lenovo Windows smartphones Furthermore I again reiterate my position that the smartphonetablet industry is no longer just about profits over hardware sales I understand that Microsofts strategy of selling cheap smartphones is a necessary evil toward rapidly increasing the number of Windows mobile users Contra revenue is a very sweet incentive to inspire more OEMs to make Windows smartphones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>makes billions in easy money from licensing its patents to Android device makers so it can afford the contra revenue on mobile devices Furthermore making Windows phones might be more cost efficient for Lenovo and other OEMs because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will not charge them any patent or licensing fees MSFT has consistently delivered excellent Cash Return on Invested Capital It has produced an average of for every invested for the fast five years Eleven other analysts at TipRanks also supports my Buy rating for MSFT Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not
