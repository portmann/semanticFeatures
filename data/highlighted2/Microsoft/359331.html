NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced many things at its recent Build conference none were closet to home for me than the announcement of Embedded for Power BI Embedded is Microsofts most recent attempt to control the pace of development in the BI space an effort its currently having great success with But why does Power BI spatial dominance matter Along with AI and VR I think BI is part of the next big valuation driver set at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Pay close attention to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is doing with Power BI the roadmap its following is that of its battle tested productivity suite With Embedded Power BI now threatens areas of BI that it isnt currently a best of breed namely the Marketing vertical this is big One week ago postMicrosoft NASDAQ MSFT Data Insights Summit attendance I wrote in an update note on Microsofts Power BI that its data and analytics engine had taken the Coronation Oath and that its engine had definitively placed itself ahead of the BI pack inclusive of names led by competitors SAP NYSE SAP Oracle NYSE ORCL IBM NYSE IBM privatelyheld Dell Qlik NASDAQ QLIK and Tableau NYSE DATA I also detailed how newly released updates to Power BI debuted andor alluded to if the updates are to come in the coming months at the Data Insights Summit would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to accelerate an already highly effective gofortheBIkill movement at the company evidenced within the update note using equity pricing datavisuals This wasis important in the scheme of things in that as with Artificial Intelligence AI and VirtualAugmented Reality VRAR I think BI is the next big market cap addition to Microsofts equity pricing Viewing the alluded to equity pricing datavisuals from my prior note quantifies and I believe validates this assumption It appears now in light of what was recently announced at Build that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was still holding on to its BIriver card at the Data Insights Summit Just weeks after the conclusion of the Data Insights Summit at its next major product and technology announce conference Build <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced that its Power BI would allow for direct integration to applications apps via an SDK software development kit While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>already allowed for something of integration to apps via an API application programming interface via pushing the new SDK update will allow for true embedding a service capacity via Power BI aptly titled Embedded In my opinion Embedded is going to make all the difference in the eventual ability for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>BI competitors to fend off commoditization and an ultimate relegation to second class citizen status Ill explain First this is perfectly inline with what is now becoming a more visible BItakeover strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in all its diversification of revenues and all its size clearly wants to commoditize the BI space Why Again it can because its not a BI pure player like say a Tableau its not completely dependent on the monetization of the platform for survival and much like in more traditional commodity markets this allows it to set the pace of development That second point is going to be one that becomes more and more important with time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is primarily concerned right now with Power BI adoption and the creation of Power BI as a base platform becoming a base platform regardless of the software allows for the attachment of what are generally referred to as switching costs or switching deterrents built into the process of switching an already efficient process from an operations standpoint For examples of how this base platform creationswitching costs attachment can create huge recurring and hard to replace revenue streams look no further than Microsofts broader productivity suite Word Excel PowerPoint etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>following its battle tested productivity suite proliferation roadmap here is no surprise To do that and to do that most effectively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to be able to control the pace of development controlling the pace of development will allow its platform to constantly remain competitive in the very least remain a best of breed at the very best and most importantly continue leveraging the comprehensive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>producttechnology ecosystem Why are all three levers important to control Well they allow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to control adoption rates in this instance to make sure its Power BI is the most adopted and highest resonating platform in the space Again to reiterate adoption rates are generally directly associated with technology development the more developed the platform the higher the adoption rate Commoditizing BI via keeping the pricing lowerequal to competitors while also offering a better platformservice allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to do all of the above while limiting the economics behind competitors reaching for further platformservice development The lowest cost atleastbaseline service provider will set the pace of development even if that means a somewhat retarded pace of development at times The good thing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is that so far at least its not just a baseline service provider thanks to it being able to leverage its comprehensive producttech ecosystem and superb engineers SEE above its a best of breed It should also be noted that again at least so far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hasnt retarded growthdevelopment of platformservice at all its allowing for both at breakneck paces Ill end the microlesson in commodity economics here That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>leaning into its app development prowess is a natural move Embedded now not only does that while also conveniently pointing to the convenience of the scale that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can bring to the table in other verticals say with Azure but it also advances the adoption and expansion efforts of Power BI in that it improves the overall capacity and use case profile of the platform Now because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is allowing its datavisuals to literally be embedded into customer applications unbranded I should note and because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has an inecosystem app building platform developers have a much simpler choice of which BI platform to use for maximum app efficacy even if BI is not a primary selling point None of Microsofts pureplay BI competitors can offer such a service Microsofts early adopter names names like Milliman finance Solomo Technology marketing Highspot sales and Nintex workflow managementHCM offer a preview into exactly which key and huge and profitable verticals that Embedded will offer a competitive advantage inover Even better if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can prove out the valueprop of Embedded at scale it could put a huge dent into a market that IBMs Watson Analytics via its Watson Analytics for Social Media Edition currently targets and dominates the marketing vertical Currently the only BI platform that I would choose over Power BI and only if I was in the marketing department or had a specific marketing role at a company would be Watson Analytics via the Edition indicated above That would be a nice storming the beach moment for Power BI if it can continue to add customers in the vertical even if via a primary interest in something other than the BI platform itself direct Embedding integration with an app building platform etc In chatting with a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Power BI product engineer on Friday the company believes it can and will do just that All told the massuser familiarity that Power BI will take from potentially having widespread app integration will have marked spatial defining benefits to the platform Again if realized at scale Power BIs primary goal above all else is to capture base platform switching costs to be so important to daily productivity that the efficiency cost associated with switching platforms will deter this from taking place SEE the broader productivity suite I believe Embedded is a step forward for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in doing just that Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this
