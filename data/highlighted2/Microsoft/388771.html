Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT reported March quarter earnings this past Thursday The stock fell the following day This has been passed off as mere noise but could be the start of investors resetting expectations for the company Its becoming increasingly clear that Windows cannot be restored to the position of dominance it enjoyed years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will have to operate in a much more competitive world of Windows Android and iOS Microsofts valuation will suffer as a result This isnt a Death of Windows article I feel the need to issue that disclaimer since when I write negative things about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>all too often its passed off as the rantings of an Apple NASDAQ AAPL fan boy Everyone knows or can see from the disclaimer that Im long Apple In fact Apple is only part of the problem and not the biggest part In its excellent Surface Pro and Surface Book devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is doing some things right that Apple isnt But Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Google has usurped the commodity PC model and made it work for the mobile first cloud first world with Android As Ive pointed out there are now multiple indications that Google is working to make Android the next PC platform not the least of which is the new windowing capability present in the Android N preview Apple also seems to be positioning iOS as a PC replacement with higher performance iPad Pro tablets featuring split window multitasking Android and iOS are modern mobile platforms They already have vibrant app ecosystems and are present in the majority of smartphones used worldwide Googles advertising and search business model allows Android to be distributed for free iOS is included in Apple mobile device purchases and updates are free Microsofts free Windows upgrade is a response to the free OS model but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>lacks equivalent revenue streams to compensate Android is primarily based on processors using designs and architecture licensed from ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH iOS devices use ARM architecture processors exclusively Windows is primarily Intel NASDAQ INTC based This gives ARM based device makers a cost advantage compared to devices based on Intel if the Intel devices are not subsidized with contra revenue The disadvantages with respect to Android and iOS have been the key factors in the failure of Microsofts phone strategy The Lumia sales implosion continues with revenue declining yy by on sales of just million Lumias in the March quarter Until recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors have been inclined to overlook the fiasco that was the Nokia purchase This view is no longer tenable The lack of presence in smartphones has an impact in other key business areas such as Windows and cloud services With Windows CEO Nadella has set about trying to convert the Windows ecosystem into a modern platform along the lines of the mobile platforms of iOS and Android This was of course the right strategy but its hampered by the lack of smartphone presence Nadella was able to report some progress in the Win user base going from million in January to the current million Of that million delta about million were new PCs reported to have shipped in the quarter using IDCs numbers So most of the new Win users are coming from new PC sales rather than system upgrades and according to Netmarketshare over half of Windows users run Win I continue to question whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will reach its goal of billion Windows users before it is time for the next OS version <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is already almost a year into what is normally a year cycle for OS versions The pressure on Windows revenue is evident in the relatively flat yy revenue for the More Personal Computing segment Operating income was up on the strength of the cutbacks in the smartphone business Although the cutbacks look good on paper Im still left wondering what the new strategy on smartphones is Cloud services has been a bright spot for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but once again growth in cloud services is inextricably linked to mobile devices and here lack of smartphone presence also hurts While revenue was up yy operating income declined yy This was due to operating cost investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is making but these were necessitated by ongoing competitive pressure not only from Google but Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Lack of its own smartphone ecosystem has forced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to cast a wider net providing services for iOS and Android devices Being platform agnostic sounds good but it gives the owners of the competing platforms the opportunity to differentiate themselves Apple doesnt offer much in the way of commercial cloud services but has been expanding what it offered to iOS developers I expect that expansion to continue with WWDC in June Once again in cloud services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is faced with a tripartite competition with Google and Amazon which may even get worse if Apple enters the fray So cloud services offers little refuge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>going forward On a GAAP basis revenue was down yy to million and operating income was down to million Even if one accepts the logic of adding in deferred revenue the yy growth was only and operating income growth was only This relative stagnation reflects the tripartite competitive landscape for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>going forward This might have been different if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had succeeded in establishing Windows Phone as a competitive ecosystem but now that that battle has been lost its hard to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ever makes up the deficit Microsofts current TTM PE ratio of probably reflects an unrealistic expectation on the part of investors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will return to the glory days of Windows dominance The likelihood of that has become vanishingly small <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can compete and will compete effectively but it will do so in a tripartite world where it doesnt have the upper hand The realization of that is just beginning to set in so I expect the market to continually lower its expectations I now rate the stock a sell I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
