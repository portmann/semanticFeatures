July Reuters When US software giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bought Nokias struggling mobile phone business last year the inhabitants of Salo a town of in southern Finland thought the move would revive the local economy But their hopes were crushed last week when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced it would close Nokias former product development unit in the town putting all jobs at risk Last year the US company had said it could hire more staff in Salo The decline of Finlands electronics industry as Nokia lost competitiveness against peers Apple and Samsung along with falling global demand for paper products and EU sanctions on neighbouring Russia have entrenched the Scandinavian country in a threeyear recession Towns like Salo home to one of Nokias first factories set up in the s have been particularly hard hit Prime Minister Juha Sipila called Microsofts decision last week a big blow and visited Salo on Monday to hear from locals how the government could best help the town A former engineer and telecoms executive Sipila was elected in April on a promise to balance Finlands budget cut bureaucracy and lower taxes for small companies He has advocated the role of entrepreneurship in getting Finland back on track but that may be a tough transition for an economy that became so dependent on Nokia Ten years ago Nokias operations in Salo employed people and even in over a fifth of all jobs in the area were within information technology Today Salos unemployment rate stands at percent well above the national rate of percent following the closure of a Nokia factory in and previous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>layoffs Closing the product development unit could push it up to percent High unemployment and the angst among Finns about where their country is headed is reflected in the rising popularity of the eurosceptic Finns Party now a coalition partner and in Finlands recent tough stance in euro zone negotiations on bailout funds for Greece Finnish politicians expressed their solidarity with Salo on social media My staff and I have been closely following the death curve said Salos mayor Antti Rantakokko referring to the decline in recent years of Windows share of the global smart phone market to just percent He said some technology companies had been in contact with him about investing in Salo but would not elaborate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in an emailed statement to Reuters said that under its new strategy the company would cut the range of smart phones it sells and so would not need three development sites in Finland Two Finnish sites in Espoo and Tampere will remain open but of its employees in Finland only may survive after negotiations between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Finnish employees expected to start later this month We were of the impression that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would give its phone business a bit longer to see if it can grow said Aimo Leskela a trade union shop steward and year veteran at Nokia Mika Paukkeri another shop steward said he hoped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would cut its staff in Salo not shut it down altogether Sipila said Finland would apply for aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund which supports people who have lost their jobs following major structural changes Manufacturing of mobile phone handsets shifted from Salo to Asia in Shopping for fabrics in a local store this week Maria Gustafsson said of the years she has spent in Salo it has never felt so bad living here First Nokia closes the factory now this MarjoRiitta Maattanen and Heidi Kirjavainen have just opened a store in Salos main shopping street for fabrics and clothing they usually sell online How ironic that we opened the shop just this week Bad timing Maattanen said Finlands coalition government expects the economy to pick up this year but cut its growth forecast last month to just percent In contrast neighbouring Sweden is looking at percent growth The Finnish government is imposing tough austerity measures after rising public debt and budget deficits under the previous administration prompted a warning from the European Commission In Salo corporate income tax revenues have slumped from million euros in to just million last year hitting municipal services such as schools and healthcare centres Sipilas calls for the jobless to set up their own businesses are greeted with scepticism Not everybody can be an entrepreneur said Kirjavainen Instead locals hope bigger businesses will take advantage of IT knowhow in Salo Many are even still counting on Nokia which said this week that it may start designing and licensing mobile phone handsets under its brand name in Nokias return to Salo would be ideal shop steward
