revenue declined yy on unit declines of yy in laptops and in desktops Intels NASDAQ INTC Q earnings offered some hope for investors in the form of improved operating margin for the Client Computing Group CCG that is the combination of the PC group and the mobile devices group as of the beginning of the year Some of this margin improvement appears to have been due to a reduction in contra revenue subsidies for Intels tablet processors Tablet processor sales fell yy as a result If investors needed proof of my thesis that Intel cannot be cost competitive with ARM processors of equivalent capability Intels Q earnings report provides that proof The truth is out there but it still takes a little digging to find it As I did for my Q Intel earnings article Ive plotted revenue and earnings for the PC Client Group PCCG before it was merged with the Mobile and Communications Group MCG on a quarterly basis for and the combined Client Computing Group for As before the PCCG data is from historical SEC filings from not the restated results for CCG The basic takeaway here is that MCG effectively contributes zero revenue to the combined organization while at the same time markedly reducing operating income CCG operating margin also suffered drastically compared to the PCCG For Q operating income and margin both jumped for CCG a good sign that either mobile related costs were coming under control or that contra revenue was being curtailed However its difficult without additional data mining to determine which is more important Ive prepared a third chart that looks at operating cost for PCCG in once again based on historical not restated data and CCG in Intel doesnt provide a breakdown of operating costs by group so this is an estimate that assumes that group gross margins for a given quarter can be approximated by Intels reported corporate gross margin for the quarter This is probably not a bad approximation After estimating gross profit for the groups operating cost is calculated from subtracting the operating income from gross profit This yields the chart below showing the difference in operating costs for PCCG in and CCG in For an organization thats reasonably stable in composition operating costs should be relatively constant as they are for PCCG in Operating costs took a big jump for the combined CCG starting in Q but this was to be expected MCG had posted a billion operating loss on negative revenue of million in Q The Q jump of over billion in operating cost for CCG was to be expected Since then Intel has been paring the losses down saving a cumulative million in operating costs for CCG through restructuring Strictly speaking this shouldnt have anything to do with contra revenue During the conference call Intel management indicated that it was along on its goal to save million this year in mobile related costs or million worth This suggests that about million was saved in contra revenue Making the approximation that revenue from the million tablet processors that Intel sold in Q and Q was essentially zero due to contra revenue then this indicates that the million tablet processors that Intel reports it sold in Q garnered million or an additional million if the previous cost wasnt zero or about apiece This would still represent a significant discount from the tray price of a typical Atom X series processor of about But even that discount wasnt enough to keep INTC from suffering a yy decline in tablet unit shipments This is the final confirmation of my thesis that Intels x architecture is fundamentally disadvantaged in cost relative to ARM Only by means of the draconian contra revenue scheme was Intel able to meet its goal of selling millionplus tablet processors last year As the contra revenue subsidy has been reduced or perhaps eliminated sales have fallen dramatically Other factors have probably weighed on Intels tablet sales as well such as the release by Apple NASDAQ AAPL of the new iPhone s featuring Apples custom A system on chip SOC which appears to outperform any Atom processor including X and X Intel currently makes In addition other ARM processor vendors such as Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and MediaTex have come out with or have plans for processors that also may rival or exceed Intels best mobile processors Despite a few wins here and there Intel is well on its way to becoming irrelevant in smartphones the most important market in mobile devices Theres a reason that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT chose Qualcomm for its flagship Lumia and XL smartphones Intel had nothing that was even close to good enough even for free Intels decision to put off until nm production is another nail in the coffin of the companys mobile ambitions Funded by such wellheeled customers as Apple TSMC NYSE TSM is not waiting while Intel takes a breather As Ive pointed out previously TSMCs stated intention to start nm production by the end of should be taken very seriously I believe that Apple will be very motivated to team up with TSMC on nm in an attempt to get ahead of Samsung OTCSSNLF It may seem that I overemphasize mobile but the continuing declines in the PC industry overall as well as the declines in Intels PC unit shipments should be motivation for Intel to make itself relevant to the mobile space CCG revenue was down yy while desktop and laptop shipments were down and respectively Intels total revenue and earnings were only spared negative yy growth by continued strong growth in the Data Center Group Last quarter I called Intel the BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY of Semiconductors and declared the company a short opportunity on the basis of its clueless management and the unrealistic expectations of its shareholders There are signs that Intel investors are starting to wake up to what the current Intel management is doing to this great American company Following the earnings call Intel shares fell after hours The continuing declines in PCs despite or in my view because of the Windows roll out and the steep decline in tablet sales had to be a splash of cold water in the face of Intel investors I wish I could say the same about Intels management CEO Krzanich and his cohorts continue to maintain the facade that Intel has a viable mobile strategy And Intel is still on track to deliver SoFIA LTE on the nm process in the second half of as if it wouldnt be totally obsolete by then In this case staying on track is the last thing Intel should be doing Intel needs to stop propping up the antiquated x architecture and adopt ARM for mobile devices The irony of Intels current approach to mobile is that the combination of Intels process leadership and the ARM v architecture could make Intel the unquestioned leader in mobile devices As long as Intel is burdened by its current management I continue to regard Intel as a short opportunity We only use your contact details to reply to your request
