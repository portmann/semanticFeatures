tower and notebook PCs is going to weigh on yearoveryear comps Backhalf results may not improve by much as I anticipate market share loss in both laptops and towers due to inferior designs Theres limited flexibility to drive improvement in the cost structure which indicates that investors shouldnt anticipate fattening margins through better efficiency The console business is going to peak this year with expectations of declining shipments and ASPs from this year forward The launch of Skylake will negate whatever performance advantage AMD is expected to get from shifting preexisting designs to a more advanced process node Adding further examination to AMDs NASDAQ AMD earnings would be redundant so Im going to focus on the longterm oneyear outlook I have on the stock And for what its worth its not pretty It will be a while before we reach the multiyear refresh point thats indicative of replacement demand Management mentions that the second quarter isnt going to be as good as OEMs are likely to burn through inventory in anticipation of Windows which will come with coveted features and marketing hype by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT So timing is crucial on the part of OEMs because they want to market newer computers that have the latest in features Its easier to move product when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is throwing marketing dollars out from the rooftops of their Redmond headquarters Clearly AMDs second half may look a little better sequentially but Im hesitant to say it will be a good year for AMD The company doesnt really operate a fab so theres limited flexibility to drive operating improvements on the back of higher fab utilizations which drives average total cost lower The cost of components is low relative to the depreciation of the equipment and facilities Since operational improvement will be driven by higher sequential comps on the licensing side where AMD has really high margins the operating performance is going to improve based more on a mixshift in segment recognition of revenue versus structural changes in operations Also the licensing business faces considerable challenges going forward as consoles arent going to perform as well due to falling ASPs and shipments are expected to either decline or grow at an anemic pace in the upcoming fiscal year Heres a direct quote from the QA from SA Transcripts When looking at the above graph handhelds are expected to decline and consoles are expected to stagnate over the course of the next three years In fact this is normal because annualized shipment volume usually peaks within the first two to three years of launch which is modeled into JPRs research hence investors should be nervous when management tries to paint a brighter picture at their midyear analyst day event This puts pressure on AMD to come up with new ideas to generate revenue but how and where The semiconductor market is highly specialized and dominated by a small number of companies that specialize in mobile communication general purpose computing application specific integrated circuits fabrication facilities printed circuit board assembly micro electromechanical systems micro controller units and commodity parts for nonecutting edge use Either people are competing on economics or value in the space and in many cases the larger players are able to package an endtoend solution that provides both value and economics AMD doesnt have that many play options and using standard football logic it would be nice to have a flexible playbook In the case of AMD there are constraints because competition is going to prevent AMD from gaining design wins in many of the high volume high margin markets that do exist Either AMD doesnt have the necessary feature set or it doesnt have the necessary pricing mechanism in place to gain significant orders Sure AMDs embedded graphics business has found its way into iMacs but for the most part its not present in the high margin fast growing laptop market Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA gains the embedded graphics business from all of the major PC OEMs because power efficiency is extremely important in that form factor Sure Carrizo promises better performance but in comparison to Intels NASDAQ INTC product stack I dont anticipate significant design wins as Intel has targeted the lower pricing tiers with an endtoend system on chip solution through the Atom X and X series In cases where pricing on notebooks exceed BroadwellU and M will remain untested and unchallenged as the performance characteristics at the WW power envelop is hard to match which is why AMD is nonexistent in the highend of the laptop market as power efficiency is given higher priority due to battery life and size constraints Also AMD is going to get squeezed in the desktop PC business as the company is exposed to the upcoming launch of Skylake which is where Intel will showcase both a transistor density advantage through second generation FinFETs paired with a design overhaul driving significant improvement in performance Typically Intel CPUs have a lot of room for overclocking which is why enthusiasts tend to build their PC rigs with a lowend Core i and start cranking the voltage A typical PC enthusiast can spend less than for an aftermarket watercooling setup which allows the PC user to send the CPUs clock speed into the GHz range which is enough to drive significant performance improvements on various benchmarks Intels release cadence is vicious heres what VR World recently reported Instead the vendor will focus its efforts on the Skylake architecture the tock in Intels ticktock release cadence cycle Skylake will also be fabricated on a nm process but will usher in significant CPU and GPU improvements along with lesser power consumption To expedite the launch of Skylake Intel is rumored to move up its annual Intel Developers Forum to midAugust where it is officially set to unveil the new CPUs Skylake for the desktop will be offered as fully unlocked versions with TDPs of W and W with a W SKU also planned for lowpower devices The chip vendor is set to begin producing the hardware in June or July with retail availability set to commence from October Honestly AMD is in a lot of trouble On a performance per dollar basis AMD will fall further behind In a market thats highly sensitive to the performance per dollar aspect of a PC build AMD will lose its footing in the tower PC business which translate into further market share deterioration which may negate whatever back half uptick in volume that management anticipates as various OEMs will be making orders in Q FY for Skylake CPUs Its highly likely that the vast majority of the PC market volume will go to Intel as the company is improving all aspects of its PCclass CPU lineup from design process node to dimensional scaling of transistors My somber outlook is mostly driven by AMDs heralded history of overpromising on its designs and under delivering on performance Its always good to compare the relative performance of AMD to Intel because at the very end of the day PC OEMs are going to go with the better performing chip on a per dollar basis In that case Intels performance will continue to scale exponentially because it has made various foundational investments in both foundry and chip design over time This is why AMD is unable to bridge the gap with a reduction in pricing because the differential in performance is too vast between generations Also consumers want the best PC experience they can get And quite frankly OEMs arent going to risk the loss of customers to competing brands by jumping on the AMD bandwagon to save what could amount to a couple dollars Its better to go with a proven strategy than to rock the ship especially when a slight change in design could amount to a reduction in shipment volume When you operate at the scale of HP and Dell the loss of customers even if it amounts to only a couple hundred basis points is a huge deal Source AMD Versus Intel Heres Why David Wont Slay Goliath In Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks
