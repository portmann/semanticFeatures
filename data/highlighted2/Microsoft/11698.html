company to establish itself in the growing enterprise IoT field Amazon can then leverage a foothold in enterprise IoT to sell additional cloud services Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has a reputation for dabbling in a wide variety of industries outside of its ecommerce origins These side ventures include everything from AWS Amazon Web Services to Kindle tablets to streaming media devices Most recently the company acquired lemetry a company that develops InternetofThings IoT solutions for enterprises Some of the initial coverage of this acquisition has focused on Amazon jumping into yet another new category or on lemetrys retailfocused offerings However instead of viewing this as a new venture the acquisition is better seen as a play by Amazon to help cement AWS as the goto cloud service for enterprise Ive previously written about the potential of BBfocused IoT companies and the opportunity this market presents Many companies are just beginning to connect their machinery and create smart factories and the IoT market is estimated to grow to approximately trillion by Vendors that can get in on the ground floor of this transition can set themselves up for longterm success lemetrys ThingFabric platform operates in this enterprise IoT niche It essentially helps companies connect their machines together and then export the data to various enterprise apps lemetrys current client list includes a few major names such as Honeywell NYSE HON and Demeter Power Group The real potential for Amazon though isnt in just getting companies to connect their machines using Amazonpowered tech its in selling enterprise companies an entire integrated stack of connectivity storage and analytics products through AWS lemetry is a step in that direction Its been clear for a while that cloud storage alone isnt a fantastic business For the last few years Amazon Google GOOG GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT have been locked in a price war thats quickly driving storage costs to almost zero Googles Nearline service which offers GB of storage for is just the latest development in this spiral The money lies in the services and applications that companies can offer on top of these storage platforms Enterprise IoT is a particularly nice opportunity for Amazon and other cloud providers because it requires a large stack of platforms to work fully Enterprises need to connect their devices and machines together which is where lemetrys technology comes into play They need a way to store all of the resulting data which is where AWS storage is key this will likely one day be provided as a free valueadd Then enterprises need a way to sort and analyze all this data in order to help them make business decisions the original promise of IoT Amazon will now be able to directly offer two of these three services in an integrated offering And while it doesnt currently offer a true business intelligence product it does provide the infrastructure for some of the most popular ones When assessing the viability and market position of AWS investors should consider Amazons IoT services an integral component of that strategy lemetrys platform allows Amazon to establish a foothold in the growing enterprise IoT market which can be leveraged to later sell additional AWS services In this way the acquisition really isnt about expanding into a new vertical but rather strengthening the companys current offerings In next few weeks Ill be writing more about the opportunities that IoT both consumer and businessfacing presents for new and established companies This will include a larger overview of the general IoT landscape that assesses which established tech companies are leading the pack Source How lemetry Plays Into Amazons Cloud
