</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still negotiated a deal with Baidu to make it the default home pagesearch engine for Chinese users of Windows Nadella deserves another pat on the back for successfully persuading Baidu NASDAQ BIDU to be one of Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT partners in propagating the advertisingfriendly Windows operating system Bingcom is not blocked in China but I understand why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants the backing of Baidu Baidu is the biggest internet portal in China It has risen to fill the gap left when Google NASDAQ GOOGL abandoned its search engine business in China in Baidu has million users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to convert more people to Windows using Baidus Windows Express service China is emerging as a fastgrowing giant opportunity for digital advertising Googles continuing absence in China is something that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to exploit immediately by piggybacking on the success of Baidu Due to the emergence of China as a growing market for searchdigital advertising Baidu is now second only to Google when it comes to annual sales from global search advertising spending Baidus market of the billion search advertising industry is far higher than that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Bings share last year Getting more Chinese people to upgrade to Windows is perfect for Microsofts greatly enhanced personal data mining initiative Like I previously mentioned in my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>article Windows has several invasive personal data mining and activities settings turned on by default Only a savvy computer user will take time to turn off all the data gathering channels of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I suspect that making Baidu the default home page and search engine for China users of Windows Edge browser likely entailed a revenue sharing agreement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>found favorable China has a big internetusing population Baidu is the biggest gateway for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to instantly access those million pairs of advertising eyeballs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is trying to imitate Googles widespread intrusive personal data mining to improve its digital advertising business Google has been doing it for decades and helped it became the worlds biggest provider of personalized digital advertising services The shift toward a freemium strategy means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now more inclined to give away free software in exchange for peoples data and their computing habits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cannot hope to steal advertising clients away from Google if it doesnt have the same massive library of personal data The whole concept of hyperlocal hypertargeted ads means paying advertisers want as much information as possible from targetaudience The more Baidu users that get enticed to upgrade to Windows and Edge the better chances that they will not turn off the privacy settings which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>uses to gather personal data and online activities The bigger the personal data library of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>becomes the more attractive it becomes to digital advertisers The economic benefit of having more Chinese people using Edge browser to surf online is also fairly obvious when we take into account that it is the only latest browser that doesnt support thirdparty extensions Unlike Apples NASDAQ AAPL move to enable thirdparty ad blocking in its mobiledesktop Safari browser <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has not shown any interest in
