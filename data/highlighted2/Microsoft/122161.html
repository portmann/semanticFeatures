Nevertheless, moving forward, we expect a healthy second half as inventory and purchase decisions pick up following the launch of Windows 10.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will push Apple down in the rankings somewhat as other manufacturers gain some overall share and may lead to a quarter or two in which Mac sales growth lags the industry as a whole. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This assumes, of course, that Windows 10 is greeted favorably, and there are no major problems. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , given that <b>Microsoft</b> 's new OS will be a free upgrade for consumers , the buying pressure may be less than otherwise would be expected . (Microsoft: Uncertainty) </span>In any case, after a couple of quarters, I think we will return to the trend of Apple growing faster than the overall PC market.We should see a return to Apple slowly, but inexorably, gaining market share.I see no real reason for a change in this anytime soon.There are several driving factors.First, the consumer base is increasing as several countries such as China and India are rapidly growing the middle class.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In these countries Apple products are regarded very favorably, sometimes as status symbols. (Uncertainty) </span>While many cannot afford anything other than low end Windows machines, many are moving into a position to afford them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Today the differences between the two operating systems are less important. (Uncertainty) </span>So much work is done on the web which is OS agnostic.Many major apps are available for the Mac, from MS Office to AutoCAD, there is a lot more compatibility than before.For companies that must have Windows to run legacy systems, this can be done effectively on a Mac via Boot Camp or virtualization.This is particularly true for those who only need occasional access to these systems.With tools such as Casper Suite from JAMF Software, Macs are as easy to manage in an enterprise environment as are WinPCs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>JAMF writes : We help commercial, education and government organizations succeed with the Apple platformï¿½ By providing a simple, flexible and scalable framework to work within, the Casper Suite helps IT admins maintain, update and ensure their fleet of Apple devices are running at optimal performance. (Uncertainty) </span>The iPad is by far the most used tablet in business.Along with the iPhone, it is helping to overcome the resistance of older IT personnel who have long scorned anything Apple.Many millennials have grown up with Apple products and prefer them.They will bring them into the work environment or request them.5 - The IBM (NYSE: IBM ) partnership The partnership with IBM (see detailed analysis ) is aimed at mobile, but the Mac is there under the radar.I'm sure that IBM will be promoting Macs to some degree or other.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Eventually, it may move to officially represent the Macintosh line. (Uncertainty) </span>In a more ephemeral line, I think that the investor should not dismiss the importance of the credibility that IBM gives to Macs in the enterprise.Few companies are regarded with such respect as IBM, at least in major enterprise circles.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that the salesforce for the MobileFirst initiative may be coming in with MacBooks will alone speak volumes to the executives. (Uncertainty) </span>In corporate IT there's a decades-long prejudice against anything Apple that's still held by many.The Mac was seriously viewed by some as a "not a real computer" and disparaged as "toy" by people who did not really know what a general purpose computer is (from a technical definition, at least).At 9.7% of revenue last quarter, Macs continue to lose their former dominance of Apple's revenue source to the iPhone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said, over $5 billion of revenue in a quarter is nothing to sneeze at and it is important for a company to not depend completely on one product. (Uncertainty) </span>Macs have another importance to Apple that will keep them around for a long time.The computer is the real anchor for the ecosystem.It is true that Apple mobile devices work with Windows computers, but Mac OSX is the one with which special features such as Handoff work exclusively.It is the best companion for iOS devices and the only computer OS-controlled by Apple.To begin with, we need to admit that Mac computers have higher price points than do other PCs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now if you try to compare two computers with similar hardware specifications, then you will find that the difference is usually less than many detractors argue. (Uncertainty) </span>You will not find a $300 Windows PC that meets the specs of a new MacBook Air at $899.Still, there are many millions of people in this world who can barely afford a used low end PC, and for them Mac prices are totally out of range.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>(It should be noted that in countries with a high value added tax, the cost difference is expanded significantly.) (Uncertainty) </span>Yet, as noted above, businesses account for 75% of computer sales and businesses are less price sensitive, especially if they can be convinced of long-term benefits such as longer life, lower support cost, lower maintenance and easier learning curve.I would argue that as time passes the Mac will be perceived as being more or less equivalent to a WinPC, as long as specialized legacy programs are not a dominant use.If this is the case, then the Mac becomes just another PC option, with the potential of being cheaper to support long term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this mind set takes hold, then Apple could conceivably move to the number two or even number one spot in the manufacturing list. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we can see from IDC's chart, Apple picked up almost two percentage points, year over year. (Uncertainty) </span>(click to enlarge) If you look at trailing twelve month total Mac sales for CQ1-15 vs. CQ1-14 (20.0, 17.3) ( chart ) you see a 16% growth rate.If you project this out, in five years, the rate would be 40 million units per year, double what it is now.If worldwide sales were to be at 320 million units per year, then this would still only be 12.5% market share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact, I think it is quite possible that the 16% growth may be conservative. (Uncertainty) </span>The factors listed above should drive continued market share growth.This is particularly true in the enterprise.Here, Apple can be considered entering a brand new market with very little current penetration.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth could be exponential. (Uncertainty) </span>At Hewlett Packard's (NYSE: HPQ ) share of 18%, Apple would be selling 58 million Macs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this rate, and assuming a slight decrease in ASP from $1,231 to $1,150, this would give revenues of about $67 billion, three times what it is today. (Uncertainty) </span>Some people will object that this is ridiculous, but all of Apple revenue for 2004 was just $16 billion, who would have thought that today it would be the largest company in the world (by market cap).So one big take away is that it does not really matter what the exact number of Macs are sold for this quarter.Whether Apple hits 5.1 million or just the street average of 4.8 million, the strong growth trend is still holding, and this is encouraging for a real positive impact on future earnings.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
