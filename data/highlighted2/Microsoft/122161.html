late about sales of Apple NASDAQ AAPL Mac computers with both IDC and Gartner publishing their quarterly PC sales assessments for both the US and the world This article will take these estimates as starting points put them into historical perspective look at them critically and see where this leads us if we project into the future As we can see from the chart below Mac sales languished in the first years of the new century until they began to slowly pick up around reflecting the very beginning of the iPod halo effect This began a new phase and sales grew more rapidly particularly after the introduction of the iPhone in In we see a real slowdown for a couple of years but brought renewed growth of over at a time when the overall PC market continued shrinking Apple has gained market share in all but one of the last quarters In the past Macs had been purchased mostly by consumers and artists with few sales in the typical corporate environment This has been changing lately driven by several factors First some see the value proposition in a computer that needs significantly less support than the Windows PC Many have written on this topic although not all agree Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO have been leaders in large companies going for Macs wholesale A second driving force has been the BYOD movement initiated by smartphones and the related choose your own device options All this has been driven by the halo effect of the iOS devices Statistics Brain reports that of personal computers sold are to businesses so expansion here is necessary if Mac sales are to continue to grow Gartner Research has just released Preliminary Worldwide PC Sales report which notes that overall sales fell Apple is not listed in the top five globally No figure for Mac sales is given but it obviously must be below fifth place Acer Groups OTC ACEYY million units For US sales Gartner keeps Apple in fourth place just behind Lenovo Group OTCPK LNVGY assigning million to the Macs for a drop in US sales of Competing research group IDC has similar numbers overall but differs greatly in their Mac estimates They recently released the Q Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker data This puts them in the number four spot edging out Acer by just over a full percentage point to with ASUSTeK OTC ASUUY at considered a tie with Acer Apple remains well behind Dell here but has advanced significantly over the past year Apple increased from a share to while Dell has increased only slightly from to In the year ago Q Dell produced well over twice the number of units as did Apple million vs million but this year only more million vs million In the US market IDC has Apple in third place maintaining an edge over Lenovo for third place to to million units Of the major players only Apple and Lenovo saw unit growth in the region All others saw sales drop Fortunes Philip ElmerDeWitt compiled a list of Mac estimates for analysts both professional and independent in all and the composite estimate was million units range to Note that this figure would make Apple number on Gartners list ahead of both ASUS and Acer just as for IDC So which research firm is correct in its analysis Aside from being an Apple optimist I believe there is good reason to think that IDC is closer to the truth of the situation for several reasons First however an argument against IDC can be made that if a rising tide raises all boats then a falling tide lowers all as well Thus why shouldnt Apples sales also be shrinking as the PC market as a whole slows The problem here is the reason for the current slump IDCs press release is titled PC Market Continues to Decline Ahead of Windows Release If the market declines in anticipation of Windows then it would only be the Windows PC market to decline It should not affect Mac sales at all Second the current trend for Apple is up and historically calendar Q has had higher sales than Q In fact since there has been only one year when this has not been the case Last year the quarterly increase was and the year over year increase was This makes IDCs numbers look much more reasonable Note calendar Q has always been down after the big holiday quarter The data shows that the trailing twelve months unit sales is constantly going up an impressive from CQ to CQ There is no reason to expect this to change anytime soon In the near term we should have conflicting reports While Mac numbers should continue to rise it is expected that competitor numbers will surge even more with the release of Windows by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Nevertheless moving forward we expect a healthy second half as inventory and purchase decisions pick up following the launch of Windows This will push Apple down in the rankings somewhat as other manufacturers gain some overall share and may lead to a quarter or two in which Mac sales growth lags the industry as a whole This assumes of course that Windows is greeted favorably and there are no major problems On the other hand given that Microsofts new OS will be a free upgrade for consumers the buying pressure may be less than otherwise would be expected In any case after a couple of quarters I think we will return to the trend of Apple growing faster than the overall PC market We should see a return to Apple slowly but inexorably gaining market share I see no real reason for a change in this anytime soon There are several driving factors First the consumer base is increasing as several countries such as China and India are rapidly growing the middle class In these countries Apple products are regarded very favorably sometimes as status symbols While many cannot afford anything other than low end Windows machines many are moving into a position to afford them Today the differences between the two operating systems are less important So much work is done on the web which is OS agnostic Many major apps are available for the Mac from MS Office to AutoCAD there is a lot more compatibility than before For companies that must have Windows to run legacy systems this can be done effectively on a Mac via Boot Camp or virtualization This is particularly true for those who only need occasional access to these systems With tools such as Casper Suite from JAMF Software Macs are as easy to manage in an enterprise environment as are WinPCs JAMF writes We help commercial education and government organizations succeed with the Apple platform By providing a simple flexible and scalable framework to work within the Casper Suite helps IT admins maintain update and ensure their fleet of Apple devices are running at optimal performance The iPad is by far the most used tablet in business Along with the iPhone it is helping to overcome the resistance of older IT personnel who have long scorned anything Apple Many millennials have grown up with Apple products and prefer them They will bring them into the work environment or request them The IBM NYSE IBM partnership The partnership with IBM see detailed analysis is aimed at mobile but the Mac is there under the radar Im sure that IBM will be promoting Macs to some degree or other Eventually it may move to officially represent the Macintosh line In a more ephemeral line I think that the investor should not dismiss the importance of the credibility that IBM gives to Macs in the enterprise Few companies are regarded with such respect as IBM at least in major enterprise circles The fact that the salesforce for the MobileFirst initiative may be coming in with MacBooks will alone speak volumes to the executives In corporate IT theres a decadeslong prejudice against anything Apple thats still held by many The Mac was seriously viewed by some as a not a real computer and disparaged as toy by people who did not really know what a general purpose computer is from a technical definition at least At of revenue last quarter Macs continue to lose their former dominance of Apples revenue source to the iPhone That said over billion of revenue in a quarter is nothing to sneeze at and it is important for a company to not depend completely on one product Macs have another importance to Apple that will keep them around for a long time The computer is the real anchor for the ecosystem It is true that Apple mobile devices work with Windows computers but Mac OSX is the one with which special features such as Handoff work exclusively It is the best companion for iOS devices and the only computer OScontrolled by Apple To begin with we need to admit that Mac computers have higher price points than do other PCs Now if you try to compare two computers with similar hardware specifications then you will find that the difference is usually less than many detractors argue You will not find a Windows PC that meets the specs of a new MacBook Air at Still there are many millions of people in this world who can barely afford a used low end PC and for them Mac prices are totally out of range It should be noted that in countries with a high value added tax the cost difference is expanded significantly Yet as noted above businesses account for of computer sales and businesses are less price sensitive especially if they can be convinced of longterm benefits such as longer life lower support cost lower maintenance and easier learning curve I would argue that as time passes the Mac will be perceived as being more or less equivalent to a WinPC as long as specialized legacy programs are not a dominant use If this is the case then the Mac becomes just another PC option with the potential of being cheaper to support long term If this mind set takes hold then Apple could conceivably move to the number two or even number one spot in the manufacturing list As we can see from IDCs chart Apple picked up almost two percentage points year over year click to enlarge If you look at trailing twelve month total Mac sales for CQ vs CQ chart you see a growth rate If you project this out in five years the rate would be million units per year double what it is now If worldwide sales were to be at million units per year then this would still only be market share In fact I think it is quite possible that the growth may be conservative The factors listed above should drive continued market share growth This is particularly true in the enterprise Here Apple can be considered entering a brand new market with very little current penetration Growth could be exponential At Hewlett Packards NYSE HPQ share of Apple would be selling million Macs At this rate and assuming a slight decrease in ASP from to this would give revenues of about billion three times what it is today Some people will object that this is ridiculous but all of Apple revenue for was just billion who would have thought that today it would be the largest company in the world by market cap So one big take away is that it does not really matter what the exact number of Macs are sold for this quarter Whether Apple hits million or just the street average of million the strong growth trend is still holding and this is encouraging for a real positive impact on future earnings Disclosure
