class='textDiv'>Is Apple Headed Into Virtual Reality Gaming Modest Money Apple is a company thats known for dominating nearly any industry it touches Now it seems as though the company may be getting into a new industry virtual reality gaming The industry currently dominated by Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is expected to be the next big thing in gaming However if Apple does make the decision to get into the virtual reality gaming industry Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may have something to worry about Today well talk about the clues that Apple is considering stepping into the space whether or not they do have the ability to dominate the industry and how this could affect Apples stock price The clues that Apple may be getting into the industry of virtual reality gaming arent anything new In fact they started about two years ago when the company acquired PrimeSense PrimeSense is an incredibly innovative company that introduced the first in a line of dimensional body sensing technology Since the introduction of this technology weve seen it most prominently used by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in Xbox In fact the D body sensing technology is the leading driver behind the Xbox motion sensing device known as Kinect The devise helps to add a virtual reality dimension to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gaming consoles When the acquisition of PrimeSense happened the questions with regard to whether or not Apple plans on stepping into the virtual reality industry started to pop up While we havent seen anything by way of virtual reality from Apple since their acquisition of PrimeSense questions are being raised about their plans in the industry yet again following the companys most recent acquisition On November th it was announced that Apple has acquired a company known as Faceshift Faceshift is a company that was founded in Switzerland that is heavily engaged in the virtual reality industry The company created technology that senses the facial expressions of those using virtual reality systems The companys technology uses the information it captures with regard to facial expressions and uses them in animations This technology made its big break when it was used in Disneys Star Wars franchise for Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens So Is Apple Getting Into The Virtual Reality Gaming Industry Apple is a company thats known for being relatively secretive when it comes to their plans for future technology So as we would expect the company has made no comment with regard to whether or not they plan to move into the virtual reality gaming industry Nonetheless at this point I dont think Apple needs to announce their plans as they are relatively clear The reality is that it simply wouldnt make sense that Apple would acquire two companies in the virtual reality industry if they didnt at some point plan to get into the virtual reality industry It could be argued that the company plans to use the technology to add new capabilities to their tablets smartphones and computers but knowing Apples history I simply dont think that they have plans to stop there While it may take a couple of years to perfect whatever technology theyre working on I do expect to see Apple moving into the virtual reality gaming space at some point Can Apple Dominate Virtual Reality Gaming In my opinion Apple can dominate anything it wants to dominate in the technology sector The bottom line is that when we talk about Apple were not just talking about the worlds largest tech company were talking about the worlds largest company period The company has a proven history of dominating any market it decides to take part in So theres no reason to think that they couldnt do the same in the world of virtual reality gaming Does Apple have what it takes to dominate virtual reality gaming Let us know your
