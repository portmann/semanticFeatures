NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts pricey Surface Book Windows laptop will have variants that will have a discreet Nvidia graphics accelerator card Nvidia and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are teasing us it is a new unreleased mobile GeForce GPU especially made for the thinbody design of the Surface Pro Whatever GPU it is Nvidia has a small tailwind from Microsofts ambitious attempt to become a firsttime highend laptop vendor I already have great love for Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT new Surface Book laptop It is a cheaper but more powerful alternative to the MacBook Pro for graphic design purposes Aside from its energyefficient Skylake Intel NASDAQ INTC CPU and integrated Intel HD GPU Im intrigued with the secret discreet Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA discreet GPU that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hinted about its upcoming equalizer to the MacBook Pro The Surface Book like the Surface Pro are obviously aimed for enterprise employees However the teaser about a secret new Nvidia notebook GPU hints <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to compete in the lucrative highend laptop gaming industry Furthermore a discreet GPU is understandable since the price tag of the highest configuration of the Surface Book is only reasonably sellable if it comes with a decent discreet GPU It is no secret that all graphics design industrystandard software like Photoshop CC and AutoCAD now rely on GPU acceleration to further accelerate their performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would not impress professionals if it only sells the Surface Book bundled with a weakling integrated Intel HD Graphics HD GPU Aside from the lack of touchscreen support of the MacBook I opine that winning the Macusing graphic designer will be easier done through the Nvidiapowered Surface Book Nvidia definitely gets a small tailwind from Microsofts first highend laptop Creative professionals rely on the MacBook Pro precisely because it used to have a discreet Nvidia GPU Highend laptops needs the extra compute power of a dedicated graphics processing unit Microsofts use of an Nvidia GPU for its first highend laptop is an important win for Nvidia Earlier this year Apple NASDAQ AAPL replaced the Nvidia GeForce M GPU with Radeon MX for its MacBook Pro product The secret special GPU for the Surface Pro will be likely as good as the Radeon MX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to make a big splash immediately with its Surface Book like it did last year with the impressive hardware specs of the Surface Pro That tabletnotebook was already an excellent PhotoshopIllustrator tool even without a discreet GPU The Surface Books discreet Nvidia GPU will make it an ultimate graphic artists weapon Adobe NASDAQ ADBE has been collaborating with Nvidia to optimize its Creative Cloud software products via GPU acceleration In essence the Surface Book will not only rely on the Intel CPU but also exploit the compute power of a Maxwell Nvidia GPU to speed up the workflows of deadlinehampered professionals The Surface Book is not a mere expensive toy for corporatead agency slaves too <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>obviously intends to market its first Surface Book to gamers My old fouryear old Acer Aspire laptop with GB GeForce GT M can play any modern PC game effortlessly on reduced graphic settings I therefore expect the newer secret Maxwell mobile GPU of the Surface Book to satisfy the graphics qualityperformance requirements of any demanding PC gamer I like Radeon GPUs but it is not a secret that the best rated Intelpowered gaming laptops now only uses discreet GPUs from Nvidia I think that Nadella is trying to build a vertically integrated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that will sell its own highend laptops and desktop computers that could compete against the pricey Mac OS X machines from Apple NVDA is a Buy Nvidia is and will remain the top vendor of discreet notebook GPUs I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to be a longterm client for Nvidias industryleading notebook GPUs An ambitious newcomer to the highend laptop industry like cashrich <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will always try to buy the best hardware components Choosing only the best GPU and CPU ensures the first Surface Book do not disappoint the expectations of industry analysts and consumers It is sweet revenge that Nvidia is now helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>create a potent rival to the Radeonpowered MacBook Pro Apples decision to drop the GeForce M in favor for of the Radeon MX GPU inside its latest popular MacBook Pro could easily be offset by healthy future sales of the Surface Book I know MacBook Pros are the industry standard tools among the majority of creative professionals However I opine that the lack of a touchscreenbased Mac laptop will eventually encourage creative professionals to defect to the Nvidiapowered Surface Book Yes it is true that an iPad could be used in conjunction with a MacBook to create digital illustrations and manipulate images However the convenience of usingbuying buyingusing just one product that can act as a tablet or computer anytime is why
