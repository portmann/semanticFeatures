</span>has just posted a scathing letter to the FCC regarding a Globalstar interference demonstration Microsofts arguments and conclusion are extremely compelling and speak right to the core of the issue the FCC will have to decide on Ultimately I still think Globalstar is a short but in this case I find that my thesis shifted somewhat for it to be a short In a comments letter to the FCC just filed and made public <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has posted significant criticism to Globalstars NYSEMKT GSAT ambition of using its satellite spectrum in its TLPS Terrestrial Low Power Service scheme as an additional WiFi channel Microsofts criticism comes as an answer to a demonstration conducted by Globalstar at the student center of a college campus in Chicago Illinois This demonstration was meant to show that TLPS did not interfere with other WiFi channels as well as Bluetooth Establishing the lack of such interference is key for getting FCC approval of the spectrum for terrestrial usage Beyond everything thats already been said regarding GSATs ambitions and how theyre unlikely to pay off its thus also noteworthy that Microsofts opposition raises significant arguments which are likely to resound with the FCC This is so because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>strikes at the heart of what will matter most for the FCC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>believes Globalstars broad claim that this demonstration shows that there are no interference or compatibility issues between TLPS and WiFi nor with TLPS and Bluetooth operations in the GHz ISM band overstates the results to the point of being misleading Why does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>believe its misleading for a bevvy or reasons Enterprise Grade Access Points Are Not Representative of the Installed Base of WiFi Access Points And WiFi Equipment By this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>means that the equipment used in GSATs demonstrations was Enterprise Grade and thus with better filtering both of the transmitted and received signals Since this equipment is but a small fraction of the deployed WiFi equipment and commercial or residential products are weaker in terms of filtering the demos are not representative Globalstars Filing Lacks Information on the Operational Parameters Used During the Compatibility Demonstrations By this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>means that important parameters were not disclosed rendering the demonstration meaningless For instance the most important parameter total transmit power was not disclosed So the demo might have been run at a much lower transmit power than the one GSAT is seeking to have Obviously a lower transmit power will make for lower interference but will also render the demo nonrepresentative of whats being sought This is also important in the regard that in a previous demo GSAT actually used transmit power levels well below th what it is seeking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also mentions the load factors of the network as not being known Demonstrations Regarding TLPS Existence interference Were Extremely Short Here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>argues that the testing done by GSAT to ascertain interference was not enough There were just tests done for WiFi and for Bluetooth over a day period with each those tests always lasting less than minutes This is especially short since GSAT itself said conditions change significantly throughout the day so testing for short bursts of time in just single days is not representative of actual use and thus of actual interference Globalstars Filing Did Not Address Important Use Cases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Has Identified Here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>argues that the environment and use cases GSAT tested for were not representative of what GSAT should have tested Proposed Network Operating Systems Will Not Protect Broad Classes of WiFi Users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>argues that GSATs proposal does not defend a large part of the population using WiFi even if Globalstar limits itself to enterprise systems Promises Alone Not to Utilize LTEU Hold Little Value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>says that theres no certainty about GSAT never utilizing LTEU technologies instead of WiFi over the spectrum whose terrestrial usage it seeks approval for Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>claims doubts regarding whether the tests of WiFi coexistence can be carried over to LTEU The overall problem which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>summarizes in its conclusion is pretty simple bold is mine It has been almost two years since the Globalstar NPRM was adopted In the intervening time Globalstar could have tried to allay reasonable technical concerns expressed by a number of trade associations representing a cross section of unlicensed GHz ISM users Throughout this time Globalstar has chosen not to conduct genuine testing but instead merely to conduct demonstrations The Commissions technical rules are by their very nature datadriven Datadriven approaches require analysis modeling and testing The student center demonstrations that examined coexistence between TLPS and WiFi and TLPS and Bluetooth fall significantly short of what is necessary to answer fundamental questions regarding such coexistence One of the strongest parts of the short thesis on GSAT is that even if it gets FCC approval the TLPS system will not be valuable However developments like those which took place today with Microsofts reaction show that increasingly the problem is that it looks like TLPS wont even be approved This powerful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>criticism makes the thesis that GSAT wont get approval stronger still especially because it strikes at the core of what might make FCC refuse approval Namely interference with other spectrum in general and the rest of the WiFi and Bluetooth spectrum in particular and the fact that no proper testing has been carried out yet to allay the possibility of such interference I have for the most part been a subscriber to the thesis that GSAT would ultimately see its spectrum approved for terrestrial usage and that TLPS would ultimately go forward but show itself to not be valuable rendering GSAT a clear short However with reactions such as this one by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>along with the arguments it makes I increasingly find it likely that GSAT wont even get FCC approval Thus rendering it an even clearer short still We only use your contact details to reply to
