deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Under the new deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will get a much lower cut of Bing ad revenue than was previously the case Most Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO investors have turned their focus on the companys planned spinoff of its Alibaba NYSE BABA and Yahoo Japan assets due to the underlying implications on the valuation of Yahoo shares Right now theres a lot of uncertainty regarding whether or not the company will pay taxes on the two deals which will weigh heavily on its valuation But investors especially longterm ones should not forget to continue examining the health of the companys business to check whether its ongoing turnaround bid is bearing fruit Yahoo released its first quarter fiscal results about a week ago Most investors were quick to notice that the companys net income had taken a long journey south Not so many however noticed that Yahoo managed to report positive revenue growth for the first time in many many quarters I lost count of the precise number awhile ago Yahoo reported consolidated GAAP revenue of million representing yearoveryear growth The positive revenue growth would have had Yahoo investors cheering was it not for the revelation that the companys GAAP EPS had tanked a jawdropping to compared with recorded in the previous years comparable quarter Yahoo pinned the large drop in earnings to a massive increase in traffic acquisition costs or TAC The companys TAC jumped to million due to Yahoos search deal with Mozilla that it struck last year as well as its mobile syndication deal and BrightRoll investments Without the massive increase in TAC Yahoos story would have been quite different Unfortunately the huge bottom line contraction dulled the fact that Yahoo Mavens mobile video native advertising and social revenue was up a healthy during the quarter to million Yahoo is banking on its mavens initiatives to provide a muchneeded boost to its growth Mavens now represent close to of Yahoos revenue Despite the rather disappointing take that Yahoos newfound top line growth had come at a huge cost to its bottom line the companys shares remained relatively unaffected after CEO Marissa Mayer announced that the company was looking for ways to unlock value from its Yahoo Japan assets Yahoo mentioned during the earnings call that it struck a new search deal with old partner <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to use Bing as the default search engine on Yahoo Yahoo did not provide much details of the deal only mentioning that the company will continue to serve Bing ads for not less than of its desktop search traffic But Yahoo provided more details about the deal in the K document that it later filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Some of the details in the new YahooMicrosoft search deal include Both companies are allowed to terminate the search deal by way of a month written notice The previous agreement only allowed Yahoo to walk away from the deal if certain revenue targets were not met Yahoo can request Bing paid search results for of searches This gives Yahoo room to carve out space for itself to develop its own search capabilities if it so wishes But the most important part of the new deal is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will now only be entitled to only of the revenue generated from Bing ads on Yahoo properties way below the of revenue that the company enjoyed from the previous agreement Yahoo has depended on Microsofts Bing to power Yahoo searches since The partnership was however quite acrimonious and Yahoo started showing signs of discontent years ago Its not clear why Yahoo was not happy with the former deal but I suspect that it felt that Microsofts revenue cut was too big and also the fact that the earlier deal forced Yahoo to become dependent on Bing for search Both the old and the current deal involve revenuesharing whereby each company gets a preagreed cut on Bing ad revenue The new deal seems to heavily favor Yahoo For one the companys traffic acquisition costs by Bing will be lowered by a significant amount This is especially important now that Yahoo has not only has to pay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but Mozilla as well Yahoo struck a deal with Mozilla last year to become its default search engine in the US for the next five years The deal resulted in an immediate increase in Yahoos search engine market share from at the expense of Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Yahoos larger search engine market share is definitely paying off The companys number of paid clicks grew during the last quarter compared to growth average before the Mozilla deal The companys search revenue grew by a similar margin But the growth has come at a cost Yahoo now has to pay Mozilla an undisclosed amount as traffic acquisition costs to use Yahoo as its search engine Judging by the massive increase in the Yahoos TAC the amount it will be forking over to Mozilla is substantial and I estimate it to be in the region of million per quarter But the amount is likely to be largely offset by a reduction in Bing revenue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will be collecting as traffic acquisition costs from Yahoo Even more importantly Yahoo now has the freedom to develop its own internal search capabilities to lower its dependence on Bing Yahoo is only bound to serve up Bing ads for of desktop searches leaving it with plenty of room to develop its own search resources I project that Yahoos traffic acquisition costs will stabilize over the next two quarters at a growth rate not far exceeding its growth in paid clicks As Mayer rightly pointed out Yahoos strong growth in its Mavens segment is poised to soon offset declines in its display segment as well as its higher traffic acquisition costs I expect Yahoos EBITDA margin which fell basis points during the last quarter to to grow incrementally to reach around over the next quarters Source Can Yahoos New Search Deal With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft
