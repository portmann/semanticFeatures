Alpha The exclusive use of Qualcomm processors inside Windows phones needs to stop The Windows smartphoneasacomputer concept can only come true using Intels processor Project Centennials promise to convert millions of legacy Windows programs to Universal Windows Platform is doubtful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT needs to revise its phone strategy With less than global smartphone share the partnership with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM is not working out It is time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to build premium Windows phones with Intel NASDAQ INTC processors A flagship Surface phone with an Intel Atom x or Core M processor is highly desirable An Intelflavored handset might improve the stale state of Windows phones Allowing thirdparty phone vendors to use any processor may also increase industry support for WM devices Aside from fringe player Acer and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ there are no other major firms that will support highend Windows phones Thirdparty manufacturers might favor Windows phones if the Continuum for Phones concept is fully implemented Continuums ambitious proposal is that highend WM phones could be used as portable computers This is a killer idea that certainly appeals to enterprise users Unfortunately all Windows Mobile phones are still exclusively equipped with ARMbased processors from Qualcomm They are limited to running watereddown versions of mobilecentric apps like Office when connected to external displays Even the Lumia XL and HewlettPackards Elite x are incompatible with legacy desktop software like AutoCAD or Photoshop A Qualcommpowered WM phone is not yet a replacement for the office laptop Only an x processor can turn Windows phones into real pocket computers Workplace and onthego productivity requires people to often use legacy Windows productivity software Due to the many differences between x CICS vs RISC processor architectures ARMbased processors are and will never be fully compatible with legacy WinNET programs I do not believe the hype over Microsofts Project Centennial tool This will supposedly convert millions of Win and NET programs to the Universal Windows Platform However Microsofts Desktop App Converter tool may work only on simple programs I doubt if it could be used to fully transform complex productivity apps like AutoCAD But just in case it works a Project Centennialconverted Win desktop program will certainly work better on x phones than on ARMbased ones After all the original codes were initially written to run on x architecture Using softwarebased conversion is not a smart way to grow apps count of WM Full software conversion of software from x to ARM is impossible to implement On the other hand the Intelpowered Windows phone instantly gets access to millions of legacy Windows software <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should bring the full Windows productivity on inch inch phones I prefer a single Windows operating system to cover phones tablets laptops and desktop PCs The Windows Mobile OS is just an unnecessary concession to ARMbased processors If my proposal to get rid of Windows Mobile OS is too aggressive the alternative is to build Intelpowered dualOS Windows phones Intel demonstrated a dualOS AndroidLinux phone during MWC event Intel used an entrylevel Atom x SoC to do this This is also feasible for a dualbooting WMWindows phone To save battery people can use it as a regular WM phone with limited productivity functions But once docked to an external monitor it boots up to the full version of Windows Staying exclusive with Qualcomm Snapdragons limits the potential of Windows phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel must collaborate on smartphones This could help them reduce the duopoly of Android and iOS The rumor of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>postponing its Surface phone is probably because Intel needs more time Once chipzilla comes up with a satisfactory SoC the businessclass Surface phone will probably feature an x not ARMbased processor The bestselling Surface in tabletlaptop products are all Intelpowered An Intelpowered phone that runs full Windows is an ideal upgrade for peoplecompanies who still use or year old personal computers Lastly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still needs to grow its phone hardware business Increasing the number of Windows phone users is a major requirement for its freemium strategy Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offers all of its apps to Android and iOS users Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL will never allow access to personal data of their customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cannot build a meaningful mobile advertising business if they cant collect the data of AndroidiOS users Furthermore revenue made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apps earned through the Google Play Store and iTunes incurs storefront fees It is therefore better for <span style='background-color:
