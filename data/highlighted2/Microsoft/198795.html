#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has announced the Surface Book which is superior to the MacBook Pro in many ways Given the robust growth of the iOS ecosystem does Apple really care about a potential Surface Book impact on the Mac <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT introduced the Surface Book on October and took direct aim at the Apple NASDAQ AAPL MacBook Pro <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>claims Surface Book is the ultimate laptop with features that current MacBook Pros cannot match Whether Surface Book constitutes a threat to Apple depends on Apples product plans for MacBook as well as its longterm strategy for Mac OS X The introduction of the Surface Book inflamed a longstanding concern Ive had about Apples strategy and direction for Mac OS X devices which I wrote about in What Is The Future Of The Mac Its not just that the Surface Book is a finely crafted machine that claims to be twice as fast as the MacBook Pro The speed claim should be greeted with some skepticism since it wasnt disclosed what specific benchmark was used or what the configurations of the respective machines were The inch Surface Book features the latest Intel NASDAQ INTC Skylake processors and in some configurations a discreet Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA GPU The current inch MacBook Pros are a generation behind in CPU and cant be configured with a discreet GPU at all These kinds of advantages tend to be transitory since they depend on early adoption of commodity processors which anyone else can also use Although SA contributor Alcaraz Research has speculated that the unidentified secret Nvidia GPU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is using in the Surface Book is somehow special its unlikely to be significantly customized The volume for the Surface Book just wouldnt justify the engineering cost which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be required to bear So the Nvidia GPU is probably just an early release of something that will soon be available to all OEMs just as the Intel CPU is now And this is the fundamental problem that all manufacturers of personal computers have whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Apple or any Windows OEM Its very difficult to get a meaningful lasting competitive advantage for a machine based on commodity processors Apple has tended to rely on the perceived advantage of Mac OS X I would certainly agree that this advantage is highly debatable Mac OS X is the more refined and betterintegrated OS Apple has done an excellent job of aligning the user interfaces of iOS and OS X I was personally a little disappointed that the finalrelease version of Windows didnt resolve the split personality of Windows with its clashing tablet and desktop user interfaces The problem with Win was not that it tried to converge desktop and tablet but that the convergence was incomplete And it still is in Win Alcaraz makes an astute observation about the Surface Book that bears on this issue of convergence Alcaraz points out that the ability to use Surface Book as a tablet as well as being able to use desktop class applications such as Adobe Creative Cloud make it a much more desirable platform for creative professionals than a MacBook Pro or iPad Pro can be either separately or together Ive been urging that Apple enable OS X for touchscreens for some time in the face of considerable resistance from numerous Apple fans who echo the sentiments of Apples management regarding convergence If theres a threat in Surface Book its due to Apple reluctance to embrace this converged future The iPad Pro may be an indicator that Apple is finally losing the not invented here attitude At the October event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>asserted with some justification that Apple is chasing the Surface Pro Yes and no The fact that Apple chose not to endow the iPad Pro with an Intel processor probably says much about Apples longterm personal computer strategy Apple hailed the iPad Pro at its unveiling as the future of personal computing Lets think about what that means This future has two key ingredients iOS and Apple custom systems on chip SOCs Ive speculated that Apple could build Mac OS X laptops with its ARM based SOCs such as the new AX in the iPad Pro Based on the performance of the A in the latest iPhone ss Plus the AX probably has more processing power that the current Intel Core M in the Retina MacBook not that thats saying much Many have pointed out that this would mean limited or no backward compatibility with legacy OS X apps This is somewhat moderated by the fact that developers with apps on the Mac App store would easily be able to port the apps to Apples SOCs That would still leave a lot of legacy code off limits for any new OS X devices that used Apples SOCs Based on the iPad Pro I believe that Apple is going to keep OS X on Intel for the foreseeable future Instead I believe that Apple is going to put its effort into continuing to grow the iOS ecosystem adding ever more capability to it iOS and iPad Pro are indicators of this direction For Apple it makes sense Apple is investing in its true money maker rather than in a marginal for Apple product In this scenario rather than making Mac OS X the converged platform and having to drag along a lot of baggage iOS becomes the converged platform able ultimately to handle so called desktop tasks as well as lighter weight tablet tasks Clearly iOS isnt there yet But were seeing the evolutionary trend in the operating system apps and hardware capability iOS received two important changes this year the ability to multitask and a new virtual trackpad mode Multitasking is essential for any OS that aspires to be a general purpose computing option In iOS its limited to running just two apps simultaneously in side by side panes but its a step towards a desktop class OS The virtual trackpad mode allows the keyboard region on the screen to become a trackpad for purposes of manipulating a text cursor Its a small but significant step in the direction of mouse and trackpad support which a converged OS would need to have In apps were seeing more and more desktop apps being ported to iOS such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office and in Adobe NASDAQ ADBE apps that have much of the functionality of desktop apps such as Photoshop Finally in hardware the increasing power and performance of Apples processors for iPhone and iPad have made them suitable substitutes for lowend Intel Core processors If these trends continue and it may take years iOS simply subsumes Mac OS X becoming Apples converged platform until finally OS X withers away Investors may have legitimate concerns about Apples nearterm product plans for OS X devices Macs are still an important product line representing about of total revenue as of the June quarter The PC market is still huge at million units in the June quarter according to IDC and therefore represents a growth opportunity that is largely unexploited At the very least Apple should move more quickly in upgrading the processors in the MacBook Pro line to the latest available from Intel Providing a touchscreen option would be another enhancement that would be relatively painless as long as Macs stay on the Intel platform Apple should do both But even if it doesnt the impact of Surface Book may be blunted by the overall decline of PC sales as well as the free Win upgrade which I expect to further dampen new PC sales Apple investors will want to watch results closely in the September and December quarters for signs of weakness in Mac sales which may already exist Apples Mac unit sales growth for the September quarter has been predicted to be flat by IDC and Gartner Even if Mac sales suffer declines in the coming quarters I would still be a buyer of Apple In the long run Mac sales may simply not matter Apple is in the enviable position unlike so many PC manufacturers of not being dependent on its Mac sales for growth We only use your contact
