class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Must Kill Off The Legacy Windows Ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha A Windows game developer has written an editorial condemning the walled garden of the Windows app store This developer would prefer to continue selling directly to consumers rather than through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The Windows app store is vital to the future of Windows so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has no choice but to dismantle the legacy Windows software ecosystem In a scathing editorial in the Guardian Epic Games cofounder Tim Sweeney all but declared war on Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Universal Windows Platform UWP UWP is Microsofts attempt to unify Windows app development for all its hardware platforms under a single Windows app store Its a write once deploy to many approach that one would think would be popular with Windows developers More importantly UWP probably represents the only viable economic future for Windows Clearly Sweeney sees something a little sinister in UWP He writes The specific problem here is that Microsofts shiny new Universal Windows Platform is locked down and by default its impossible to download UWP apps from the websites of publishers and developers to install them update them and conduct commerce in them outside of the Windows Store Sweeney accuses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>of unfairly advantaging UWP apps with features unavailable unless developers submit to the control of the locked down UWP ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hasnt abolished apps developed outside of UWP but it clearly is trying to coax developers into using UWP rather than the older more open Win Sweeney would like to eliminate the walled garden allowing developers to sell UWP apps directly to consumers just as most PC apps have been sold In the process <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be unable to collect the fee it charges for the Windows app store Ironically Sweeney points to Android as the progenitor of this new despicable business model without ever mentioning Apple NASDAQ AAPL or iOS once Epic Games through its Chair Entertainment Group subsidiary had developed one of the most successful games for iOS Infinity Blade in Epic games still has games and apps on the iOS app store and continues to make the Unreal Engine development kit available for game developers under iOS But there hasnt been much new development by Epic for iOS in a while and Epic appears to be mainly focused on its Gears of War franchise which is actually one of the few UWP games Its likely that Epic has become more than a little disenchanted with the walled garden of iOS and is unhappy that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is going in the same direction As an iOS developer I can certainly sympathize Developing for iOS is very challenging and it doesnt help that each new iOS generation is accompanied by a host of poorly documented changes that pretty much guarantee your app will no longer function But thats the limit of my sympathy Peter Bright in a rebuttal on Ars Technica titled Tim Sweeney is missing the point the PC platform needs fixing points to all the solid technical reasons why the new UWP is an improvement on the existing Windows ecosystem I wont belabor his technical arguments Bright only points out what all of us yes that includes yours truly Windows users already know Windows for all its openness is a chaotic mess of conflicting hardware drivers and software We live with this because the very openness of the ecosystem has some advantages in hardware cost as well as the ability to customize systems Ironically Brights missing the point as well as Sweeney This isnt about the technical advantages of UWP or even the practical benefit to developers of UWP as a simplified way to develop Windows apps This is about the cruel economics of competition in the mobile device world Right now Windows isnt competing with other desktop operating systems such as Mac OS X or Linux Right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is locked in a battle for survival with the other main personal computing ecosystems of Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android and Apples iOS I know its an unfamiliar concept to regard the mobile device ecosystems as personal computing ecosystems but thats what theyve become And both have comparable number of users to Windows In turn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is attempting to reshape Windows in the mobile device ecosystem mold through Windows I pointed this out in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Mobilizes The PC This transition is more than just moving Windows to more mobile devices such as phones tablets and in convertibles The transition is also one of fundamental changes in Microsofts business model These changes mostly involve emulating to a greater or lesser degree the business models of Apple and Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>tried to adapt the classic PC OEM licensing model to Windows phone and almost immediately it broke down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ended up having to give Windows phone away for free to its main partner Nokia With neither Apple nor Google charging consumers or OEMs directly for mobile operating systems or upgrades <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has had to follow suit with the free upgrade program for Win Even though this is supposed to be temporary I think its unlikely that consumers will ever pay for another Windows upgrade Windows as a direct revenue source is probably going to become increasingly unimportant and this leaves the Windows app store as a key revenue source from Windows going forward Under the circumstances the motivation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to transition its Windows users to Windows becomes self evident <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt getting much revenue from its legacy Windows ecosystem Sweeneys editorial underscores the fundamental difficulty <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>faces in managing this transition to a modern mobile device business model Just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is breaking down the barriers of the old OEM model by fielding its own excellent Win devices its also breaking down the old developer model with UWP There was bound to be friction and unhappiness on the part of Microsofts partners as I have noted in the case of the OEMs I didnt anticipate this kind of blowback on the part of developers but I should have The Windows developers have grown accustomed to the commodity PC business model and dont want things to change But change is coming and neither Tim Sweeney nor Epic Games nor anyone else in the Windows developer community can stop it My reservations about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>mainly revolve around its ability to manage this transition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>seems to be in a have your cake and eat it too mode where it seems to preserve the old PC business model while simultaneously dismantling it This is an unachievable compromise that forces <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to dissemble about its true intentions Sweeneys editorial shows that this isnt really working <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO Nadella needs to provide developers with more clarity on the transition that is taking place with a roadmap milestones and a timetable This is the best way to ensure that as many developers are on board with the change as possible Because of the difficulties that Ive foreseen regarding this transition I remain somewhat cautious on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>rating it a hold I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any
