class='textDiv'>The New Apple TVs Missed Opportunities Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple introduced the new Apple TV at its September event as well as a new operating system tvOS and an app ecosystem Unfortunately tvOS lacks much of the functionality of iOS and is focused on content delivery and games almost exclusively Given more compelling Android TV hardware such as Nvidias Shield console the new Apple TV faces an uphill struggle in the marketplace Like many Apple NASDAQ AAPL investors and fans I was looking forward to the next iteration of Apple TV and was initially impressed by what was shown at the September event Then I started delving into tvOS the operating system for the new TV I found that tvOS lacks much of the functionality of iOS that users take for granted The future of TV may be apps but the future of those apps is very limited in tvOS This calls into question the competitiveness of the new Apple TV in what is becoming an increasingly crowded market When I started looking at the developer documentation I was shocked by how much iOS functionality had been excised to create tvOS The documentation for tvOS is available to anyone not just developers so Im not giving away any proprietary information Among the APIs removed were many covering basic iOS functions as well as some of the most important enhancements to iOS in recent years HealthKit health tracking and monitoring for iOS and Watch OS devices MessageUI message and mail functionality MultipeerConnectivity necessary for Handoff and Continuity features that allow you to start something on one iOS or Mac OS device and then transition easily to another SafariServices provides a Web browser framework Social supports social networking apps and allows integrating social networking accounts in an app WatchKit provides a way for iOS devices to interface with Apple Watch WebKit provides basic web page rendering for apps and third party browsers This is by no means a complete list of what was removed What is left in tvOS is mostly focused on games and streaming content It could be argued that much of the functionality that was removed would be impractical to implement using the very limited form of user interface available through the new Apple TV remote The new remote incorporates a trackpad as well as a few basic buttons for selection and navigation Of course the basic problem with a track pad is that finger motion has to be visually correlated with position on the display screen This problem got solved a long time ago with the moving onscreen cursor But Apple simply will not allow an onscreen cursor to infect its precious little iOS claiming that this is somehow too difficult for TV watchers to contend with Ive used both Windows PCs and Mac OS X PCs for years in home theater systems and I never found the onscreen cursor difficult In fact I grew to prefer the Mac OS X system because I could use it with the Magic Track Pad which was just perfect for navigating from across the room For the new Apple TV Apple offers what amounts to a very coarse form of cursor as app and media icons that visually expand when selected Its basically the same form of visual feed back mechanism as the cursor but dumbed down to movement between large blocks of the screen For the old Apple TV this worked fine but for a new TV that supposedly supports true app functionality its a crippling limitation The new Apple TV remote includes a microphone to access Siri but Siris functionality seems once again focused on navigating and viewing content Apple didnt remove any game related APIs especially Metal which provides for OS layer acceleration of graphics functions Developers of iOS games will be able to port their games to tvOS will minimal effort For fans of iOS games the new Apple TV will provide a way to enjoy their favorite games without having to use Airplay from an iOS device This will be an important selling point for those already heavily invested in the iOS ecosystem Its not going to win over any converts from Android consoles or PC gaming however As good as the hardware is an A SOC its not even close to the latest consoles from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Sony NYSE SNE In fact the hardware seriously lags Nvidias NASDAQ NVDA Shield Console which has a superior graphics engine that can support K TV and runs the Android TV operating system Perhaps PCs and consoles can not really be thought of as the competition for the new Apple TV as theyre in a different price category but Android TV devices of which Shield is the best are competition Shield is the same price has much more capable hardware in the form of the Nvidia Tegra X processor and has access to Android TV apps and games Apple and Android TV operate on very similar user interface principles so Apple doesnt really give much up to Android TV in that regard I dont doubt that tvOS will be much more refined than Android TV But Android TV was introduced more than a year ago and will be starting its second iteration when Android M comes out later this year This should count in Androids favor The new Apple TV faces stiff competition in the living room from higher priced consoles and from comparably priced Android consoles What could have set Apple TV apart would have been the ability to access a wider range of iOS apps I would have wanted to see consumers have the ability to access messages email even browse the web from their couches I may be a little biased here My television viewing experience like many who have cut the cable has already evolved into a PClike experience translated to a bigger screen With ingenuity tvOS developers may find ways around the many missing APIs but its clear that Apple wants to channel apps into content delivery and games This appears to be more a marketing decision than a technology driven one If Apple had endowed the new Apple TV with a full suite of iOS APIs and a reasonable cursor driven navigation approach it would have perish the thought become competitive with Mac OS X Not merely competitive but a much lower cost alternative So it appears that tvOS has been hobbled and iOS as well by concern about cannibalizing Mac OS X At this juncture given the massive importance of iOS as a growth area this is completely misguided As Ive discussed many a time the convergence between touch and desktop operating systems is continuing whether Apple likes it or not I expect the new Apple TV to sell very modestly in the range of a few million units per quarter The value proposition just isnt there especially outside of the iOS ecosystem Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
