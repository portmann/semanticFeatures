hard to find Depending upon how you calculate it Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and IBM NYSE IBM are the two largest cloud service providers in the world at about billion a year in sales each Both reported billion in cloud revenue for the first quarter In the Amazon Web Services segment revenue grew to billion And from IBM CFO Martin Schroeter in IBMs conference call In the quarter our total cloud revenue grew to billion with the asaservice components growing Amazon is best known with its AWS Amazon Web Services that include such well known customers as Netflix and Zynga while IBM tends to concentrate on corporate and institutional hybrid cloud customers that keep some things on the cloud but other things in house Beyond cloud services of course the two companies have strikingly different business models Amazon gets more than of its revenue from their online retail sales channel while IBM gets more than of their revenue from providing software service mainframes consulting and analytics In this article I will compare the investment merits of each company I did a similar comparison with Amazon and traditional retailers in this article Buy Amazon At PE Or Get Dividend At PE Sales are going in the opposite direction In the last few years IBM has been transitioning away from their traditional hardware package software and datacenter model to a model that emphasizes services cloud and cognitive functions This has resulted in decreasing sales Amazon on the other hand has continued its relentless pursuit of more and more online sales and in addition has added AWS as a secondary source of income and profits As the chart below vividly shows IBM has seen its revenue drop consistently over the last years while Amazons has more than doubled over the same time period In Amazons sales surpassed IBMs for the first time On other financial metrics IBM is a powerhouse If we look at profits EBITA or Free Cash Flow IBM is way ahead of Amazon And note IBMs billion in FCF is after paying billion in dividends But interestingly equity is about the same Amazons net operating margins are very small compared to IBM at about compared to IBMs IBM has lead the world in patents for years in a row IBM has almost scientists in its labs all over the world developing new products and technologies Although it is has discontinued most of its hardware products its ever increasing investment in cognitive data analytics and IoT functions like that from Watson and the Weather Channel means it will become a hightech source of very highmargin services I wrote about the Weather Channel acquisition here Reasons IBM Is A Buy Whether You Like The Weather Or Not Amazon on the other hand is arguably the leading retailer of the st century It reminds me of Proctor and Gambles NYSE PG takeover of the retail markets in the th century With AWS Amazon is taking something it needed to develop to stay competitive and expanding it enormously for use by other large companies A great marketing idea but akin to a REIT where large amounts of capital are invested at a certain rate with expectations that it will give a return much higher than the original cost of capital and Operating Expenses OPEX This does not mean AWS is not a high tech product it is but IBMs services to the cloud are intended for a much higher value proposition than AWS services But AWS does have some sophisticated happy customers as shown in this youtube presentation by Capital One Pundits on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere are constantly warning us of the big market correction that is well overdue Some speak of some much more than that If you think a correction is inevitable sometime in the not too distant future then you should consider the following According to Yahoo Finance AMZNs beta is and IBMs is or about half Here are two charts that show the comparison between the two stocks over two slightly different time periods The first chart shows that AMZN and IBM are virtually identical in their Yeartodate increase But in the nd chart you see that when there is a correction like the SP NYSEARCA SPY correction between late December and late February AMZN falls off the cliff That is to be expected when your beta is So if the market falls to how far will AMZNs stock price fall Seems to me would not be out of the question YTD comparison from martketwatchcom This comparison is about investing for dividends with some growth compared to potential huge growth without dividends One company IBM is in turnaround mode and one Amazon is in growth mode I believe that AMZNs electronic warehouse approach with AWS will over time have much lower margins than IBM or Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT hightech cloud service approach Competition in AWSs market is increasing with very large technically sophisticated rivals such as IBM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Oracle NYSE ORCL competing for the same customers What unique abilities can AWS offer those customers that the other three cannot Nothing I can think of I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Dividends Income Dividend Ideas Technology Expert Insight </div></body></html>
