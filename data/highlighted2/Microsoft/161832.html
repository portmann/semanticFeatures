Windows will stimulate the PC market and will benefit both companies INTC has compelling valuation metrics and high earnings growth prospects its EVEBITDA ratio is very low at the fifth lowest among all SP tech stocks The company is generating strong free cash flows and returns value to its shareholders through stock buyback and increasing dividend payments The average target price of the top analysts is at up from its September close price however in my opinion shares could go higher than that According to new data from two research firms PC sales are continuing to fall sharply Worldwide PC shipments totaled million units in the second quarter of a decline from the second quarter of according to preliminary results by Gartner This was the steepest PC shipment decline since the third quarter of PC shipments are projected to decline in According to IDC worldwide PC shipments totaled million units in the second quarter of This represented a yearonyear decline of about one percent below projections for the quarter Although slightly different both reports are painting a gloomy picture for the PC market However two new developments could convince both consumers and corporations to buy new computers The first one is the recently launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Windows which has been considered by many users the best Windows operating system The second development is yesterdays introduction of Intels NASDAQ INTC th generation processor family Skylake which is according to the company its best processor ever According to Intel there are over million computers in use today that are four to five years old or older They are slow to wake their batteries dont last long and they cant take advantage of all the new experiences available today Built on the new Skylake microarchitecture on Intels leading nm manufacturing process technology th Gen Intel Core processors deliver up to two and a half times better performance triple the battery life and graphics that are times better for seamless and smooth gaming and video experiences versus the average yearold computer They can also be half as thin and half the weight have faster wakeup time and battery life that lasts virtually all day Microsofts Windows is also optimized for Skylake meaning that users of Skylakeequipped hardware running the new operating system can expect results closer to top benchmarks than would have been likely with previous processor platforms Although Windows upgrades are free Intels CEO Brian Krzanich thinks customers will still have to get a new PC in order to fully enjoy all the best features offered on Windows he explained in an earnings call A lot of the really good features of Windows things like Windows Hello where you have facial log in and you dont have to use all your passwords the Start screen and your ability to go through that the touch usages of gaming as the new games come to this product those are going to run on PCs that have the latest features That combined with products like Skylake over the long haul I think Windows will be a boost to the PC market This might sound like wishful thinking by an interested person However in my view it makes sense After all being fond of tablets when it comes to work PC is the choice and we all feel frustrated when the old machine reacts so slowly According to Mr Krzanich theres always a little bit of a stall right before a new product like Skylake combined with a new OS like Windows which the majority of these devices will run on That tends to have people waiting to see what those products are going to be However in my opinion after receiving excellent feedback from the new products PC sales will recover Many consumers and corporations have postponed their new computer upgrades waiting for a significant improvement which in my opinion should have materialized with Microsofts Windows and Intels Skylake processors Stronger PC sales will benefit both companies among others INTCs stock has underperformed the market in the last few years Year to date the company is down while the SP index has decreased and the NASDAQ Composite Index has lost Moreover since the beginning of INTC has gained only In this period the SP Index has increased and the NASDAQ Composite Index has risen However in my view the recent retreat in Intels price offers an excellent opportunity to buy the stock at an attractive price According to TipRanks the average target price of the top analysts is at up from its September close price however in my opinion shares could go higher than that INTCs valuation is excellent the trailing PE is very low at and the forward PE is also very low at Furthermore its Enterprise ValueEBITDA ratio is very low at the fifth lowest among all SP tech stocks According to James P OShaughnessy the Enterprise ValueEBITDA ratio is the bestperforming single value factor In his impressive book What Works on Wall Street Mr OShaughnessy demonstrates that years of backtesting from to has shown that companies with the lowest EVEBITDA ratio have given the best return In addition INTCs margins and return on capital parameters have been much better than its industry median its sector median and the SP median as shown in the tables below In its latest quarter the company generated approximately billion in cash from operations paid dividends of billion and used million to repurchase million shares of stock Intel has been paying uninterrupted dividends since The forward annual dividend yield is pretty high at and the payout ratio only The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was at over the past five years was at and over the past ten years was very high at According to Portfolios AllStars Graham ranking system INTCs stock is ranked first among all SP tech stocks The AllStars Graham ranking system is based on investing principles of the wellknown investor Benjamin Graham The ranking system is quite complex and it is taking into account many factors like trailing PE ratio price to book value and EPS growth as shown in the Portfolios chart below In my view the introduction of Intels th generation processor family along with Microsofts new Windows will stimulate the PC market and will benefit both companies INTCs stock has underperformed the market in the last few years However Intel has compelling valuation metrics and high earnings growth prospects its EVEBITDA ratio is very low at the fifth lowest among all SP tech stocks Furthermore according to Portfolios AllStars Graham ranking system INTCs stock is ranked first among all SP tech stocks In addition Intel is generating strong free cash flows and returns value to its shareholders through stock buyback
