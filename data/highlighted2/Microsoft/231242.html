tablet the iPad Pro available for sale While the hope is that the Pro will turn around sales of the struggling tablet line it also might provide some competition to Apples Mac Recently Tim Cook questioned the future of the PC so investors might want to wonder if the Macs best days have already come Recently in an interview with the Telegraph Apple CEO Tim Cook made some interesting statements regarding the PC I think if youre looking at a PC why would you buy a PC anymore No really why would you buy one Yes the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many many people They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else other than their phones Cook is naturally trying to pump up the iPad Pro which Apple has reportedly been very conservative about initial sales When the company launched its larger screen phones the expectation was that sales of the iPad mini would be hurt This seemed like a good tradeoff however given the phones selling price was much higher and the iPhone is a higher margin product In the case of the iPad Pro you have to wonder if the opposite reaction will occur The Mac can have selling prices in the thousands of dollars meaning the iPad Pro would be a trade down for the firm Initially there also is likely to be a margin hit as Apple always sees lower margins with new products until production ramps up and supply issues are resolved In Apples most recently reported quarter the Mac line showed unit sales growth over the prior year period This quarterly result was a new unit sales record for the Mac with over million sold However as seen in the chart below this was the slowest year over year unit sales increase in two years Source Apple financial information page The Mac has been gaining market share while the overall PC market is contracting However growth has slowed as tough prior year comparisons kick in and the stronger dollar hurts the situation overseas As seen in the chart below IDC is forecasting the PC industry to contract further next year with stabilization not happening until IDC sees total PC shipments for just barely above those seen this year so there isnt a lot of room for growth in this space While Apple may hurt Mac sales with the launch of the iPad Pro the company also is seeing some new competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT which has unveiled the Surface Book <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>touts the inch touchscreen laptopMacBook Pro rival as the ounce for ounce fastest inch laptop ever made The Surface Book is available this holiday season and Apple could ship approximately million iPad Pros in the calendar fourth quarter As a result I would not be surprised if Apple reports a year over year decline in Mac unit sales at some point during its fiscal ending September period perhaps even in fiscal Q With tough comparison periods and a continuing rally in the dollar we may have seen the peak of the Mac for now I dont think a declining Mac is a reason for investors to dump Apple shares currently but the situation is worth watching The company does need to find a solid number two product to back up the iPhone and I recently detailed how the iPad could do that with an upgrade program While Apple could continue to make small market share gains the Macs upside seems a bit limited given extra competition a declining PC industry and the rise of more tablets like the iPad Pro Unfortunately this seems to be a case where cannibalization among Apple products might result in a small revenue and earnings decline overall between the Mac and iPad lines I would only become cautious on Apple if we start to see analyst estimates rise too much While the company has some new products this quarter like the Watch and Music the iPad will probably show another year over year decline and I detailed today how the Mac may show some weakness At the moment analysts are calling for billion in fiscal Q revenues which is near the top end of the companys guidance range For now I still think Apple could beat giving shares room for upside to their alltime highs but I would get worried if analysts end up expecting closer to billion in revenues for the current quarter We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the
