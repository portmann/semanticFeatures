class='textDiv'>The Basics Of AMDs Most Important Product Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMDs next architecture Zen is expected to arrive in late There has never been so much importance for a new architecture released by AMD Without going into complex details I explore why Zen is so important and what kind of doors it unlocks in AMDs not too distant future When it comes to AMDs NASDAQ AMD stock there are strong opinions shouting from both sides of the fence especially here on Seeking Alpha Many contributors such as myself have jumped back and forth on the companys survivability but there still is a steady dose of mixed thoughts When it comes to AMD we either hear that its a cheap stock with an insane upside or that its withering away This magnitude only demonstrates that AMD is a risky company and the stocks risky trends are only evidence of this Due to this Ive moved from giving buy or sell recommendations and have instead transitioned into providing information to help investors come to their own conclusions In this article I will focus on the reason why I and some others remain long AMD and thats Zen Not everyone understands the underlying intent and potential of the Zen core architecture and only see it as a product to package and give AMD another chance Although this is true theres much more to it than that For the sake of simplicity I wont be diving into complex details and instead want to focus on what the fuss is about with Zen what its purpose is and what doors it unlocks as a product So the purpose of Zen is really no different than any other architecture made by any other semiconductor company to create great CPUs Unfortunately building architectures are extremely tedious and take about four years to perform AMD has two distinct architecture types with one focusing on low power products such as lowend notebooks and the other focusing on extreme performance or at least that was the goal The lowpower Jaguar now Puma architecture is an excellent chip and respectable contributors on the matter have consistently praised the architecture design as superior to Intels NASDAQ INTC Atom products However we all know how desperate Intel was to soak up the mobile market and the contrarevenue scheme destroyed almost every chance that AMD had to sell these cores On the other hand we have the highpower Bulldozer core that has been modified and renamed over the years with titles such as Steamroller Piledriver and Excavator With the industry being so complicated many customers bought into the latter three cores thinking they would be something different only to be disappointed I guess AMD had to sell something right It has been a little over four years since Bulldozer started clearing ground and it didnt take long to realize the failures The old CEO was fired and soon after the highlypraised chip guru Jim Keller returned to AMD after moving to Apple NASDAQ AAPL and started working on Zen with a clean slate approach Recently Jim Keller has left the throne in his typically shipjumping fashion and is now over at Samsung OTCSSNLF but AMD has assured investors that the core has been taped up and is ready for a late launch Being a cleanslate approach we havent seen any major leaks just yet All we know is that its products will feature four six or eight cores that are all optimized for performance which will put it up against Intels i i and i CPUs particularly in the desktop area Weve also learned that it will be using a new AM socket and that new features to compete with Intel will play an important role This is especially important as complicated tasks such as h video compression for K videos start to become really important If AMD is ambitious we could see it create APUs featuring its nextgeneration GCN architecture as well as HBM which would be overpowering Intels DDR memory Other improvements that will help Zen fall under the manufacturing process or specifically the companys longawaited transition into FinFET transistors at a much finer process Until AMD clarified it it was asked when it would use FinFETs at almost every conference call or event Its likely that Zen will start with Global Foundries nm which would be competing with Intels nm process and this would be leaps and bounds over AMDs current nm planar process Its expected that Intel is getting ready to move to nm but with the progress of Global Foundries Samsung and TSMC Im optimistic that or nm wont be too long after Zens debut The most important part of Zen is what it unlocks as a product In addition to being competitive desktop and notebook chips Zen unlocks the door to the server and workstation market that Intel has shut AMD out of Intels highend processors have absorbed of the server market and with Zen AMD finally has a chance to take some share back The situation also is the same when it comes to highend desktops and workstations These two markets are targeted toward enterprises and professionals and AMDs lack of competition has allowed Intel to monopolize the areas and generate massive margins One thing to note is that some of these markets may not be initially tackled by Zen itself but rather the enhanced Zen Plus cores Another area that Zen unlocks is a new target market for its semicustom business For current consoles AMD was paid by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Sony NYSE SNE to develop chips for the PS and Xbox One However the failure of Bulldozer forced the use of the lower power Jaguar architecture but going forward AMD will actually be able to produce highperformance semicustom solutions with Zen This also is one of the reasons why I recently wrote that AMD could be assigned to a new round of gaming consoles much sooner than we originally thought Finally Zen fully opens the door to whats possible with performance notebooks low and midrange desktops and most other products that AMD is currently selling in Even in highend gaming notebooks AMD has a big opportunity through Zenbased APUs featuring the next generation of GCN A current highend gaming notebook requires buying into the highmargins of Intels CPUs which includes paying for the Intel integrated GPU that wont be used and purchasing a separate highmargin Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA GPU This is exactly why these two companies arent inside of the PS and Xbox One and its why I believe AMD has a big opportunity in gaming notebooks Also Ive written about AMDs big opportunity in affordable notebook gaming and this chance can bear fruit under a Zenbased APU featuring nextgeneration graphics A current highend gaming notebook relies on buying into the highmargins of Intels CPUs which include paying for the Intel integrated graphics chip that wont be used and purchasing a highmargin Nvidia GPU This is exactly why these two companies arent in the PS and Xbox One and its why I believe AMD has a big opportunity in gaming notebooks A new architecture by AMD has never before been so important and this is because the weight of the entire business future is resting on it Servers workstations desktops notebooks gaming consoles semicustom solutions and other similar products are all markets that AMD has either lost or missed out on due to the failure of its current Bulldozer architecture The reason why I included gaming consoles was because Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could have built better gaming consoles if Bulldozer was better I believe AMD is very lucky to be around today and is even luckier to have another chance to redeem itself with Zen To some investors such as myself this is an opportunity not worth passing up but as I mentioned in the introduction I cannot simply recommend buying or selling the chipmaker due to the high risks entailed Its important that individual investors perform their own research and reach their own conclusions with any investment especially with a
