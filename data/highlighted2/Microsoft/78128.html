progress in India Indian and Chinese markets have much in common India does have some specific problems not encountered elsewhere It was President Eisenhower in the s who initiated the domino theory in Asia It was the belief that when one country such as China or later Vietnam fell to communism the rest of Asia would follow suit by means of contagion The idea was proven in the end to be a fallacy but Apple NASDAQ AAPL has initiated a domino theory all of its own As has been pointed out in several articles including one I wrote last year the iPhone and related products have swept through Asia and the continent has become vital to the companys success The iPhone has its largest market share anywhere in Japan where it is estimated at China has fallen in love with all things Apple despite many skeptics who wrongly predicted that Apple could never win out in a socalled Third World country with its own smartphone manufacturing industry Elsewhere in Asia Apples market share is booming almost everywhere even in South Korea the homeland of archrival Samsung OTCSSNLF As the graph below produced last year with IDC data shows smartphone growth rates in the next few years are forecast to be much stronger in Asia than in North America or Western Europe Asia has a population of billion or billion if you exclude China and India This compares to million in Europe and million in the USA In addition Asian countries on the whole have faster economic growth rates and a much younger demographic So Asia will become more important to Apple in the next few years not less The one domino left to fall is India a country that poses specific problems for Apple India is poor compared to China According to World Bank figures the countrys GDP per head is US compared to China at US Chinas population is only slightly higher though at billion compared to billion and there is a huge and growing middleclass in India with a similar liking for high profile consumer goods An Ernst Young report estimates that Indias middleclass will grow from million in to million by and to million by The countrys GDP rose last year and is forecast to grow at an annual rate in excess of every year up to Another major problem with India is the entrenched corruption at every level of society This can cause real problems for a US corporation overseas apart from the fact that such endemic corruption leads to its own inefficiencies This is one reason we are unlikely to see Apple owned stores anytime soon in the country Another negative factor that could slow down but not halt Apples advance in the country is the lack of a large installed base A major reason for Apples success in country after country is the stickiness of its ecosystem allowing it to meet all of a customers needs for phones computers music players gaming etc This lack of a large installed base may or may not slow down the release of Apples new products in the country For instance Apple Pay is unlikely to hit India any time soon as the country has a relatively unsophisticated banking system credit cards are not as widespread as in developed countries and there is not that large an installed base of iPhone s and s which Apple Pay needs to function The Apple Watch is however expected to officially hit India soon India was not one of the nine initial markets for the product nor one of the further markets announced on th June These further markets included South Korea Taiwan and Singapore evidence of the importance to Apple of Asia for this new product Of the countries which will have the Apple Watch by the end of June six will be in Asia The Apple Watch is already available in India through crossborder ecommerce players and is reportedly creating a lot of interest Apples delay in launching it officially in the country is probably due to the lack of a marketing and sales backup for it in the country As with China the gold edition could be popular in a country where there are plenty of rich people and conspicuous consumption is not frowned upon As the Baselworld report showed luxury watches are big sellers in Asia and the huge growth in China was a reason for Apple being so keen to launch Apple Watch in that market India represented of the worlds luxury watch market but grew at an impressive the previous year as the graphic below shows It was the third fastest growing market in the world behind China and Russia Recent reports from Counterpoint Research and IDC may well show that Apple is beginning to get a grip on what could be a huge new market for its products There is some conflicting data in the two reports but certain trends remain clear The Counterpoint Research report for the first quarter of gave evidence that the phone market in India in general is upgrading While the mobile phone market as a whole contracted yearonyear that for smartphones grew India is ranked by Counterpoint as the third largest smartphone market in the world for mobile phones As with China a couple of years ago the market leader is Samsung with a strong local presence in the form of Micromax Intex and Lava We all know what happened in China when Apple came up against Samsung and cheap local competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Lumia is pushing hard in the market as are Chinese brands Lenovo and Xiaomi There seems to be an increasing race to the bottom in the country by certain manufacturers leaving Apple to garner the high end once again Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is also strong in the market with their lowcost Android One strategy According to Counterpoint Apple showed strong growth in the quarter and should easily pass one million sales in the first months of its fiscal year something it took months to do last year As with China the availability of the iPhone in phablet size has been crucial to this growth The report estimates that of smartphones sold in the country are of the phablet variety Apart from the phablet attraction though Apples sales have also been boosted by the availability at cheaper pricing of old models s c and s in what is still a value for money market for many consumers The report estimated that Apples sales so far have not come so much at the expense of Samsung which introduced the Galaxy S to the Indian market in April this year Rather it came at the expense of local manufacturers as the market upgraded in general in terms of quality and brand awareness It seems Apple and Samsung will fight out the top end here in the same way they did in China The IDC report deals with the final quarter of and has Samsung as the biggest vendor with local manufacturers Karbonn Intex Micromax and Lava doing well In turn it highlights the rise in sales of smartphones over basic feature phones during a period when the market as a whole for phones contracted It put this contraction down to temporary factors mainly large channel inventory following the festive season IDC forecast strong growth in smartphones for the course of It sees increased market share for higher end smartphones towards the end of as G networks roll out in the country IDC believes this will also herald a move towards demand for smartphones with more highend features At the same time IDC noted the race to the bottom from companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and HTC Long term it saw some challenges from imported phones by possible moves by the Government to give preference to phones made in India Somewhat related to the issue of corruption there is the problem in India of legal disputes Xiaomi which has been pushing hard in the country faced a ban after a dispute with Ericsson over alleged patent infringements OnePlus One also from China faced a ban after a legal dispute with Micromax Other companies have been mired in legal disputes over retail distribution Apples market share in India at the end of last year has been generally estimated at just which represents a sevenfold increase over three years That is it is growing rapidly from a small base The retail quagmire that is India may prove a hurdle It is hard to imagine Apple Stores around all the big cities of the country at this point in time The company has been operating through two premium resellers Redington and Ingram Earlier this year it appointed US based BrightStar as a third retail partner probably to focus on smaller stores in smaller cities around this large country Some Indian press reports were stating that Apple intended to open stores in India but I have seen no evidence for these rumors Other unsubstantiated press reports have stated that Apple is targeting to sell million iPhones annually by Greater China now represents of Apples worldwide sales and grew quarter over quarter in the first quarter of making Apple probably the countrys largest smartphone vendor Mac sales there grew in a market where PC sales declined Retail stores are expanding rapidly and apps being written specifically for the Chinese market Other Asian markets have seen similar trends for Apple In fiscal Q revenue in Asia excluding Greater China and Japan grew a remarkable It is easy to see India going the same way Its smartphone market is in a very similar position to that of China in the past couple of years There is a similar increasing aspirational middleclass who may well turn from Samsung and local manufacturers to Apple The economy is growing rapidly and educational standards are rising Like the Chinese middleclass Indians tend to be very status conscious when it comes to brands A surge in sales in India will not be as substantial in pure numbers as China has enjoyed in the past year India will probably remain more price competitive than China for a while as regards hardware sales Profits from a successful software strategy may be important to maintain Apples traditional high profitability in this market Nevertheless strong growth in the worlds third largest mobile phone market should have a meaningful impact on Apples figures and hence its share price India is another reason to be bullish long term on AAPL Source Will India Be The Next Domino To Fall To
