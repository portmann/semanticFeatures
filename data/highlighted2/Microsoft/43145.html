one of the segments that continued to do well The cloud stacks up well against AWS in terms of margins Azure makes up small part of Microsofts overall cloud which can minimize the impact of price cuts in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>recently released its thirdquarter fiscal report that exceeded most investors expectations and caused a pop in the shares Indeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares have gained more than over the last five days alone the companys best day gain in a long time One of the key highlights from that report was Microsofts cloud which once again posted splendid tripledigit growth up during the quarter Investors have become accustomed to Microsofts cloud growing almost effortlessly in tripledigits over the past two years or so It brought in revenue of billion on an annual run rate of billion placing it necktoneck with Amazons NASDAQ AMZN AWS which reported revenue of billion The big difference however is that AWS is more or less a pure IaaS and PaaS cloud while Microsofts commercial cloud combines Azure Office and Dynamics CRM Online From the infographic Azure has roughly market share versus for AWS By using AWSs revenue of billion and the relative market shares of Azure versus AWS we can work out that Azure brought in about billion during the quarter though the figure is probably a little higher because what we have here are the market shares for fourthquarter whereas what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported were figures for firstquarter Microsofts thirdquarter fiscal Azure has been growing at almost double the rate of AWS which means the gap between the two is gradually closing with Azure gaining market share and AWS losing it And that brings me to the second part of my thesis Microsofts Cloud is Less Susceptible to Commoditization If the figures I have worked out above are any good which I believe they are then Azure constitutes just of Microsofts cloud This is great news for investors for a couple of reasons The first and most important is that Microsofts cloud is not as vulnerable to the vagaries of commoditization or price cuts as AWS is ZDNet worked out AWSs operating margin in the nice infographic below From the infographic above AWS sports an operating margin of around and gross margin of around as per Barrons Microsofts commercial cloud revenues are lumped in the Commercial Other category The category finished with revenue of billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>explains that the Commercial Other category lumps together cloud revenues as well as premier support services and consulting services The Commercial Other segment finished with a gross margin of The analysts however did not provide estimates for Dynamics CRM another important element of the cloud I estimate the gross margin of Dynamics CRM to be around based on gross margins of CRM companies such as Salesforcecom NYSE CRM Regarding the revenue of Dynamics CRM Gartner provided the following data late last year Salesforcecom finished the year with revenue of billion which places Microsofts CRM revenue around billion per quarter using the relative CRM market shares of the two companies That in turn means that Office brought in revenue of million during the last quarter Using these revenue figures for the main elements of Microsofts cloud we can work out Microsofts cloud gross margin which clocks in at roughly a bit higher than the companys corporate gross margin of Barrons however said that Office s gross margin is likely to gradually rise and stabilize around the range that is typical of SaaS companies meaning that gross margin of the entire cloud is likely to gradually improve Currently AWS and Microsofts clouds have very similar revenue and gross margins But Microsofts cloud carries a big advantage over AWS in that its far less likely to be affected by future price cuts such as the ones we witnessed last year Azure is the segment that is likely to be negatively impacted by price cuts since it has IaaS and PaaS components and Azure constitutes just of Microsofts overall cloud revenue Moreover it already sports a better gross margin than AWS versus which is hardly surprising given how aggressive Amazon has been with AWS price cuts in the past This gives Azure more room to wiggle At the moment its not very likely that any of the cloud leaders will be willing to engage in cloud pricing wars such as the ones we witnessed last year anytime soon I think these companies have figured that the cloud has really good growth runways so there is really no need to cut prices to the bone But when growth starts slowing down dramatically you can expect that we will see another round of price cuts Microsofts Cloud is a Darling in the Enterprise Microsofts cloud is currently the overwhelming favorite for enterprises A survey done by Cowen analysts late last year revealed that close to of organizations planned to use it over the next over the next months more than double the number for any of the other major cloud vendors Microsofts cloud is preferred by organizations mainly because of its sound hybrid strategy its ease of connecting to other clouds and the ease of shifting workloads from the cloud to the enterprise whenever the need arises AWS does not have a clearly defined way that organizations can bring their cloudbased machines back inhouse which smacks of vendor lockin Moreover Azure uses the same virtualization platform that companies use in datacenters IaaS and PaaS clouds are expected to grow at CAGR through compared to just growth for corporate IT But the cloud leaders such as Azure and AWS are likely to continue growing much faster than the overall market Microsofts cloud is likely to continue with its strong growth momentum as the company continues to transition to a cloudbased platform Source Why Microsofts Cloud Is Likely To Maintain Its Strong
