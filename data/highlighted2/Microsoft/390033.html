Alpha Xamarins importance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been elevated now that Build has revealed larger plans for it Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>successfully do this balancing act of wooing developers while creating a solid presence for Windows as a mobile operating system The end effect is a highly networked company where each business unit feeds off the others Its a tough target and Nadellas presence at the helm is vital to success In an earlier article called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Made A GameChanging Acquisition I explained why I thought the acquisition of Xamarin a multiplatform app development company with over million developers on board would be a gamechanger for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Two months later since Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Build developer conference the importance and value of Xamarin to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has gone up several notches The company now seems to want to exploit every possible angle and advantage from their new toy Welcome to the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>no more walled garden No more my way or the highway and most importantly no more fear of letting go of the past They way theyve embraced the open source community alone shows how their strategy has undergone a drastic shift Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is no longer a multidepartment company each unit going its own way oblivious to what the other units are doing This is a company that is redesigning all its business units to create a network of entities that can literally piggyback on the success of each other When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bought Xamarin I knew that it was going to be a game changer Why else would a company known for promoting only its Windows platform buy a company whose core competency is developing apps for iOS and Android devices Yes the huge developer community that was already on Xamarin was indeed an attractive proposition but few people could have imagined that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would let Xamarin continue to exist in its current form The old <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would have attempted to bring Xamarin into its own way of thinking but Nadellas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is positioning it as a gateway for its open source community push thereby furthering the agenda for their newfound love fest for a community theyve alienated for so long So Xamarin is now responsible for the developer side of things but I think its also the breather that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs while executing its other strategies for mobile first In a sense theyve left the door ajar so Windows as a mobile OS gets the room it needs to grow stronger With Xamarin developers can now put out apps for all three iOS Android and Windows Without Xamarin breaking Androids stranglehold in the mobile ecosystem would have been near impossible Even with Xamarin the path is long and arduous But the embracing of all things open source gives them a wisp of a chance at taking on Android in the future How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is Becoming a MultiTouch Company Whats even more significant about Nadellas strategy is that mobile and cloud are being married to each other within the companys framework If you are a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Azure customer then the Office suite is just a click away And if you are a subscriber of Office <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>makes it easier for you to use it on the Azure cloud The great thing about your Office subscription is that it lets you use the same user license on many different platforms and environments including the Azure cloud When you use Office applications in Azure RemoteApp you dont need to purchase additional licenses or configure your existing licenses in any special way All you need is an Office subscription that includes Office ProPlus Office ProPlus enables shared computer activation this feature enables temporary userbased activation for Office in virtual and cloud environments like Azure RemoteApp and Remote Desktop Services If you are a developer then use Xamarin to develop apps for iOS Android and Windows and while you are at it why not test it in the cloud Though this not the equivalent of moving developers into the Azure platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is using their current strength in the cloud to allow developers to exploit the advantages Theres a plethora of amazing options available to Xamarin developers when its time to add a cloud connected backend to your mobile app Recently I created a small application called Coffee Cups leveraging Azure Mobile Apps Easy Tables to create a XamarinForms mobile app on iOS Android and Windows UWP with full online and offline synchronization in under minutes When developing mobile apps we may want to share some of the data across all installs of the application but some data may be specific to the user For instance with Coffee Cups which I use to track how many cups of coffee I drink in a given day I would only want to see my data not data for everyone who is using the app This is where adding authentication to the mobile app comes in and its a breeze with Azure Mobile Apps In gaming monthly active users of Xbox Live grew year over year driven by the growth of Xbox One and Windows Xbox One continues to outpace prior generations in both reach and engagement At the same time we continue to create synergies between Xbox One and Windows devices Bringing top Xbox One titles to Windows Store helped grow gaming hours on Windows by over last quarter And starting this summer universal Windows apps will run on Xbox One making it easy to build applications and games that work across devices The lines between the different departments within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are thinning by the day and the choices for a customer to move from one vertical to another and leverage that freedom keep growing As Nadella creates this network effect within the company he needs to be very careful about how he brings down the wall of red tape that such a large company typically possesses As such his constant presence is now a critical component of this network that is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The initiatives Ive spoken about are not designed to help earnings over this quarter or the next or quite a few down the road These are foundation stones that wont be seen above ground level once the new structure of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is made visible but they are designed for longevity It will be at least two years before we can see a sizeable body of apps for Windows emerge from the XamarinUWP marriage Possibly more Before then it doesnt make sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to even think about pushing Google out of its Android comfort zone The timeline factor for each of these initiatives in development mobile and cloud is critical because it has to mesh together perfectly when the time comes The rudiments are there and the response is positive but the ultimate test is yet to come From an investment perspective I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a solid company to bank on They may not dominate cloud and they certainly wont dominate mobile in a big way But what they will have at the end of the day is significant market share in both to sustain the companys future growth Please follow me on my journey of discovery
