NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts fate depends on moving customers enmasse to the cloudbased Windows Microsofts attitude has changed from leading customers to accommodating them After a year spent dealing with his companys giant bureaucracy Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Satya Nadella quietly rolled out the strategy for his version of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>this week Nadella is pushing the hardware over to the side under Terry Myerson who also runs Windows and dropping the Ballmerera dreams of phone leadership entirely with Stephen Elop leaving The company also quietly released a new version of its OneNote cloudbased editing app but for the iPhone Not for Android not for Windows Phone but for the Apple NASDAQ AAPL platform where its most commonly used This is important It means Nadella is determined to follow his users not lead them There is evidence however that users are resistant to the new attitude Both my adult children recently got notices from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>suggesting they can get Windows free Both declined saying they distrust the company And it seems that their distrust is not just anecdotal Even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>employees are having a tough time making the new attitude clearly understood and appreciated This is the biggest cloud on Microsofts horizon pun intended Nadella is trying to rebuild the companys relationship with its huge but shrinking customer base and hes having a tough time Its obvious that Apple is accreting moreandmore of what used to be considered office work Macintoshes maintain a price point averaging while the new Surface Pro costs thats a good measure of perceived value But if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can hold its share of the operating system market as Windows becomes moreandmore directly competitive with iOS and Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android maybe things can go in the other direction Meanwhile while Apple moves into territory formerly reserved for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is seen as moving into territory formerly reserved for IBM NYSE IBM and Oracle NYSE ORCL the control of large enterprises Microsofts corporate customers now see a clearlydefined strategy for moving operations to the cloud and Microsofts moves to accommodate those who also use OpenStack or the Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN EC cloud actually makes this clearer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock is up about since Nadella became CEO But those gains are not reflected in the companys financials Quarterly revenue is up yearoveryear between the March quarter of and that of Net income is down yearoveryear Things are good in that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is dragging over of revenue to the net income line and the dividend was raised cents last summer representing just half that net income so its affordable The gains outpace the SP averages but most of those gains mainly reflect multiple expansion the PE has moved from to There are high hopes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in other words and the new strategy seems both logical and considered The question is whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can communicate its new attitude to customers whether customers buy in and whether that gets the topline moving in a positive direction as a result Investors will have an easy shorthand to understand the answer Ask how the cloudbased Windows is doing If the answer is great then buy buy buy If its no then sell sell sell Source Nadellas <span style='background-color:
