have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Microsofts cloud computing platform Azure is growing quickly and represents legitimate competition to Amazons Amazon Web Services or AWS cloud platform Microsofts subscriptionbased model for its Office suite of products should increase lifetime value per customer by and investors should appreciate the more reliable revenue stream A dividend yield represents a premium to the SP yield And with per share in cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has plenty of capital to continue increasing its dividend As we kick off a new year our focus is turning to investment opportunities that provide stability and risk management Positions that have potential for reliable growth and investments that pay generous dividend yields One of the stocks that has risen to the top of my list is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Historically the company developed a reputation of being a slowmoving software company with very little innovation But since Satya Nadella took over the CEO position in February of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has become much more responsive to a rapidly changing technology world Wall Street analysts currently expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to generate per share in fiscal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>operates with a June year end This represents earnings growth of over the per share earned in Thanks to the companys improved prospects shares of MSFT moved higher in settling at per share The year also marked the first time since that shares have hit a new high While shares of MSFT outperformed the flat market in and trades very near its alltime high new adjustments in the companys business model should continue to send the shares higher this year making MSFT one of my top choices for income investors in During the fiscal first quarter Ending September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported that Azures revenue grew by over last year This rate of growth is significantly above the rate of growth that Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN reported for its own cloud computing division Amazon Web Services Azure is far from a small startup division for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Research firm FBR Capital Markets expects that Azure will reach an annual run rate of billion this year In Amazons AWS Services pulled in billion So while Amazons growth rate will likely keep AWS ahead of Azure for a few more quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is quickly narrowing the gap Investors should note that Amazon currently trades at a valuation of nearly times this years expected earnings per share Much of that premium is because of investors optimism for AWS growth and profitability While Azures revenue for this year will only represent about of Microsofts annual revenue of billion the divisions growth rate and the potential for wider profit margins could lift the overall valuation for Microsofts stock much the way Amazons valuation is much higher than it would be as a simple online retailer For the past several quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been selling its Office suite of products including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Word Excel and PowerPoint to a subscriptionbased revenue model Under this platform users pay either a monthly or an annual subscription fee to have access to the latest version of these products By adopting this subscription model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is able to capture more reliable revenue from its products instead of relying on new releases of the suite to drive large onetime sales events Investors should appreciate this model because it helps to smooth out revenue and create more visibility for future quarters The model turns out to be more profitable over the long run as well According to a recent Barrons article subscription required at link <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>believes that the new model will boost average revenue for each user by times The article also states that there are now million retail customers using the new subscription revenue model and of the companys corporate users have also adopted this model Offering software through a subscription model and using the cloud to distribute the software and store much of the data is a model that has been excellently employed by Salesforcecom NYSE CRM Investors appear quite taken with this subscription model as Salesforce commands a valuation of more than times expected earnings for this year CRM operates with a January fiscal calendar Microsofts sheer size and slower growth rate will prevent the company from trading at a tripledigit forward PE But the companys multiple could certainly expand as it adopts a subscription revenue model that adds more value to each customer and leads to more reliable periodic revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>currently pays a quarterly dividend of per share While this only nets out to an annual yield near <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should be able to significantly increase its dividend over time The companys last dividend recorded on November th represented an increase of over the August dividend More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been increasing its dividend every year except for since the company began paying a dividend in August of Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>currently has billion or about per share in cash on its balance sheet This gives the company plenty of cash to use for future dividend increases or for a special dividend such as the dividend paid to investors in November of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has also been using its massive cash position to buy back shares of stock and reduce the overall share count At the end of there were billion shares outstanding Today that number has dropped by nearly to billion Fewer shares outstanding means that more cash is available per remaining share With Microsofts stock now trading at a high valuation more on that in a moment it is becoming less strategic for the company to use cash to buy back shares Investors wont be pleased to see the company using cash to pay a higher price for its own shares and so there will be more pressure on management to use the billion to pay out investors Later this year I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to announce another dividend increase possibly much more than the increase from Meanwhile the yield is still above the yield on the SP Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Despite The High Valuation Today shares of MSFT are trading near times expected earnings This represents a peak valuation compared to anytime over the past five years A high valuation for shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>make sense simply because the companys prospects today are better than they have been at any time in the past five years Under Nadellas leadership the company has become innovative and responsive to changes in the business environment Not only is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>improving its products to make them more user friendly the company is also selling these products in a manner that makes them more accessible to consumers and ironically drives more lifetime value per customer The Barrons article mentioned above stated that shares of MSFT could rise by over the next months That projection may wind up being too conservative According to YCharts Analysts are expecting MSFT to earn per share in fiscal If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues to execute on its growth strategy with Azure and the company is able to convince analysts of the higher customer value as a result of subscriptionbased products that projection could increase to or more If investors are willing to pay times earnings for this estimate a valuation that implies significant growth expectations but still falls short of the valuation placed on Amazon and Salesforcecom the stock would reach a share price of This represents a increase over the next months giving investors a strong potential return alongside a healthy and growing dividend yield This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is one of
