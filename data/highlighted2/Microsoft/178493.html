class='textDiv'>How Apple Should Be More Like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Both Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have a lot of cash on their balance sheets and return significant amounts of capital in dividends and repurchases However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is much more aggressive in returning cash to shareholders specifically through very high dividend growth Microsofts yield is almost twice Apples yield Apple should take a page from Microsofts book and return a greater percentage of its free cash flow even if it has to issue more debt Both Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT have excellent balance sheets stuffed with cash have strong fundamentals and reward their shareholders with rising dividends and share buybacks But in one key area Apple falls short of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is much more aggressive than Apple in returning cash as a percentage of its free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>provides a much higher dividend yield and also much higher dividend growth than Apple For an income investor who might be choosing between the two heres which one may be the better stock to buy for dividends Both Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>include a mix of dividends and share repurchases in their capital allocation programs The difference between them is that Apple is more conservative when it comes to returning cash to shareholders The company prefers to retain more free cash flow and keep a greater portion of its cash on hand presumably to invest back into the business in new products whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>returns more of its free cash flow to shareholders Over the first three quarters of its current fiscal year Apple repurchased billion of its own stock and paid an additional billion in dividends for a total capital return of billion It generated billion of free cash flow in the same period meaning Apples capital returns represented of its free cash flow Meanwhile in Microsofts recently concluded fiscal year it utilized billion to pay dividends and billion to repurchase shares That represents a total capital return of billion in fiscal In the same period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>generated billion of free cash flow leaving a cash shortfall which has been filled by raising debt This willingness to distribute more of its free cash flow has allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to increase its dividend at far higher rates than Apple Income investors should note Microsofts dividend yield which is well above Apples dividend Over the past five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has increased its dividend by compounded annually including its recent dividend raise Since Apple instituted its current dividend program in late it has increased its dividend by compounded annually That is a respectable number but again falls short of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt afraid of raising debt to return a greater portion of cash to shareholders and nor should it be While some investors shudder at the prospect of a company taking on debt its a financially sound strategy right now Thats because interest rates remain extremely low and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can take advantage of this by issuing cheap debt and can create value in excess of the cost For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trades for times its adjusted earnings per share in fiscal That represents a earnings yield In addition the companys dividend stands in excess of By taking out debt and using the proceeds to repurchase shares and increase dividends the returns are greater than the cost of the debt being issued None of this has jeopardized Microsofts balance sheet In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is one of only three US companies to hold the AAA credit rating from Standard Poors It makes sense to leverage its excellent balance sheet strength to create additional value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been able to retain its topnotch credit rating even though it returns more to shareholders than it generates in free cash flow and utilizes debt to make up the difference It stands to reason that Apple would not endanger its own credit rating by pursuing a more aggressive capital return program And its worth noting that investors have not punished <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for its more aggressive capital returns Far from it if anything Microsofts stock has benefited from its significantly higher dividend yield and stock buybacks as a percentage of free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is valued at times its trailing twelve month adjusted earnings per share while Apple trades for times earnings Clearly investors are not punishing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>That serves as an indication that investors understand and agree with the financial strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is employing Some investors may counter that Apple cant be more aggressive with its capital returns because it holds the vast majorityapproximately of its cash overseas Thats true but its also true that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>holds a large amount of its cash overseas as well That is the inevitable cost of generating the majority of revenue and profit outside the United States which is the reality nowadays for most large multinational companies such as Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and many others But that hasnt stopped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>from being more shareholderfriendly by paying a strong dividend and as far as I can tell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has not had to cut back on its strategic growth initiatives Its true that Apple has taken on debt in recent years to finance its cash returns At the end of last quarter it held billion in longterm debt up from billion year over year But Apple can still take out a lot more debt and retain an excellent balance sheet The companys total debt to total assets ratio is still a very healthy and its longterm debt to equity ratio is a comfortable This is a testament to Apples strong balance sheet and immense financial flexibility As a result it may be a good idea for Apple to take a page from Microsofts book and significantly increase its dividend going forward Disclaimer This article represents the opinion of the author who is not a licensed financial advisor This article
