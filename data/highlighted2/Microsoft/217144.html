NTDOY SNE WMT by Matthew Waterman Activisions Skylanders created a popular new type of experience in Since then Disney Nintendo and now Lego are interested in competing with them Video games using real life figures are a hot market This was obvious to me when I attended E in July this year Activision Blizzards NASDAQ ATVI Skylanders have been dominating in this space since Spyros Adventure was first released in In their annual report ATVI said that they had sold over billion worth of Skylanders games and related figures Since then other companies have noticed their success and have become interested in getting in on the action The games connect a small external platform to your Sony NYSE SNE Playstation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Xbox Xbox One or Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY Wii U video game console You place a figure on that portal and the figure appears inside the game Its essentially the same as downloadable content or DLC except that the function has been in the game since the start and buying the figures only unlocks it Disney NYSE DIS launched a competing product called Infinity in It has had two sequels now but does not appear to be making the progress that the company had hoped for Lego has a similar product called Dimensions that just hit retail as well but you have to build everything that you use in the games All three companies took up a lot of floor space at E with displays of the latest figures for each but the pricing I see at retail tells me that this segment is becoming saturated The games are fairly different in scope with Skylanders being a more traditional story based action and puzzle game Infinity has some story elements in the form of missions but puts more emphasis on creating your own story Infinity includes a robust build your own world set of tools not far removed from the popular hit Minecraft whose creator is also now owned by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I have been monitoring the prices of these items at retail at both my local Toys R Us and at various online sellers like Walmartcom NYSE WMT and Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN While Skylanders displays at retail have remained virtually unchanged in both the size and price of the products except in the case of older figures Disney is selling their new figures and games for less The latest Skylanders version called SuperChargers sells for for the starter pack which includes a couple of figures and the portal for them The Infinity version of this package is selling for at Walmartcom marked down from its starting price of Both companies also sell a software only upgrade but in that case the Infinity version also sells for about less There is a deluxe version of both games that is currently retailing for so that is an encouraging bit of news It shows that Disney has stronger characters and if not for the game that the figures included have value to the consumer The Lego starter package has entered the market at as well which shows that they are at least confident that they can compete here Time will tell Disney appears to be losing its footing here Pricetiering has shown a similar trend in the release of individual new figures with Disney selling theirs around Skylanders at about and Lego figures starting at The difference in pricing is very meaningful here especially when it comes to the markdown of the game that I mentioned above It means that Disney has not been able to capture the attention of gamers in the way that it had hoped Disney has therefore been forced to lower the cost of their entry point in order to move units What is also interesting to note here is that there is a licensed line of Mega Blok toys for the Skylanders Giant series That gives Mattel NASDAQ MAT a piece of the action too without having to put the financing into acquiring the Skylanders brand on their own since they own the Mega brands now It may be that Star Wars does not have the brand appeal that Disneys older stories have brought along It could also be possible that gamers would rather have someone else tell the story than create their own Nintendo has also partnered with Activision to produce licensed versions of their characters as exclusive bonuses for the Wii U version of Skylanders SuperChargers That is fascinating to me because when Activision was searching for a company to sell this technology to Nintendo was the first one that they approached At the time Nintendo wasnt interested However they went and developed their own figurebased games with Amiibos The Amiibos are not a requirement to have to play the games that they are in they just add small changes in features to their existing games Nintendo claims that they sold more than a billion dollars worth of Amiibo figures last Christmas The fact that they went back to Activision must mean that they recognize that their games are blockbusters Disney does not release precise figures for all of its internal divisions but is likely selling enough of these games and figures to at least be turning a profit on them However it is not likely that they are overtaking the sector so for the time being it is likely that Activision Blizzard will continue to carry the kids game through While the results of this years Christmas sales remain to be seen it seems safe to bet that Skylanders have the upper hand meaning that to coin a phrase from the game SuperChargers launched in time for Christmas are stronger in this area I rate Activision a buy Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities
