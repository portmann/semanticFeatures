class='textDiv'>Hardware Is Vital To Microsofts Future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Mac sales have quadrupled in the last ten years and with cheaper solutions Macs are now becoming a viable option to Windows machines Microsofts Surface has the ability to grow with the same foundation that Apple has had but has a larger user base to work with Microsofts innovation is inspiring new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>fans which have never been seen before due to Microsofts formerly indirect relationship with the customer Apples NASDAQ AAPL efforts to rapidly expand the Mac into the consumer and enterprise markets have delivered exceptional progress and could start placing further pressure on Windows in the coming years In the last ten years Mac sales have more than quadrupled and in its recent earnings Apple explained that its enterprise tactics are now bearing fruit noting that IBM has more than Macs deployed in its offices with more than being added each week IBMs transition was driven by lower costs and higher residual value which were valued at almost per computer With Apples prestigious brand name and the new halo effect that will undoubtedly come from record iPhone sales it looks as though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT could be in trouble Unlike before the Mac is now offering viable alternatives to Windows computers at allegedly better value Fortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has spent the last several years bridging these gaps as the Surface lineup has been executed brilliantly I expect to see massive growth to come to the Surface with the very same foundations that helped the Mac grow brand equity residual value and the halo effect With Microsofts shares trading near alltime highs its difficult to recommend buying it due to the Surface Instead I would like to focus on the growth potential and benefits that the lineup will bring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the years to come The hardware innovation is exceptionally good and with the arrival of the Surface Book laptop its clear that we will see the ambitious lineup engage new form factors such as allinone desktops workstations and likely a solution for every Mac on the market Theres no wondering why in the last twelve months the Mac generated B in sales in spite of its tiny market share With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>holding the lions share this is a huge opportunity that could be very beneficial to shareholders in the long run Perhaps the greatest benefit of Microsofts hardware strategy comes from the brand equity that it can yield Apple proved that hardware is incredibly important and as unfortunate as it may be the hero in the eye of the customer is the hardware innovator As such when it comes to Android Samsung often takes the spotlight instead of Google Before Microsofts Surface its relationship with the customer was limited to what unmotivated OEMs provided As a result customers had poor experiences such as dealing with outsourced call centers when they needed computer support When compared to Apples simple Genuis Bar solution Microsofts image takes a hit Thankfully the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Store and Surface were inspired to take action and with an identical approach to Apple I strongly believe that customers will come to associate themselves with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>not Dell Samsung OTCSSNLF OTCSSNNF HP NYSE HPQ Sony NYSE SNE or any other OEM on the market Another fact working in Microsofts favor is its inspiring level of innovation The devices keynote for the Surface Pro Surface Book and HoloLens were arguably the greatest technology presentations of the year The rare standing ovations and loud cheering for a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>event serves as proof Furthermore as Apple is now seemingly following Microsofts lead with products like the iPad Pro we will come to see fans pride themselves in Windows in the very same way that Mac users did in the Mac vs PC days This equity will work wonders in Microsofts favor as the Mac is now growing to be a viable and affordable alternative to Windows solutions If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt arm itself with an equal level of loyalty it will struggle should Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>be on the same playing field One of IBMs decisive factors in owning Macs was due to its cost savings for IBM noted that it saves almost per Mac The first two iterations of the Surface and Surface Pro were poorly received among customers so residual value has taken a hit but the strong reception of the Surface Pro in addition to its highquality design has played a valuable role in its exceptional residual value The SP has been around for months but its value has barely fallen according to this Los Angeles area Craigslist search which is very much in line with how Mac products perform Surely when it comes to most consumers the thought of residual value doesnt come to mind However many Apple product users come to realize that the computers and iPhones have very good value retention which in the end boosts brand loyalty This only reminds me of my broken Toshiba laptop from If I had bought Apples entrylevel MacBook the white one at the time for and if it were still working I would be able to sell it for up to according to LA Craigslist results while the working Toshiba wouldnt even go for Fortunately those who own Surface products following the Surface Pro and Surface will be very pleased to know that they wont be suffering from big depreciation down the line I know that residual value played a small role in my loyalty towards Apple and Im glad to see that it can do the same for Surface users Prior to the successful Surface Pro <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stated that its not interested in competing with our OEMs when it comes to hardware In fact our goal is to create new categories and spark new demand for our ecosystem The Surface Pro fell exactly in line with that statement But in spite of its marketing claims it couldnt replace the laptop for everyone And since OEMs were still failing to compete with MacBooks I wrote that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should create its own laptop as well Im very excited to see that they followed through with the Surface Book but I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can expand the Surface into a whole new array of products at least one for every different kind of Mac on the market The next steps that we may see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>make are a highend allinone desktop PC because OEMs are failing dramatically when compared to the K and K iMac on the market On Microsofts behalf this would be a longterm investment into the future of its hardware development as there are many benefits from a broader portfolio of products First revenue wouldnt fall sequentially as it did last quarter due to the Surface Pro s market anticipation Secondly it would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to pioneer technologies that could be strategically spread throughout all of its products such as Apples Force Touch which started in the Apple Watch and made its way to the MacBook Pro and iPhone S Thirdly and finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can develop a product ecosystem that would rival Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could use its billionplus users to channel a halo effect into its hardware just how the Mac benefits from the hundredmillionplus iPhones on the market Apples market cap is a clear example of what happens when hardware is entered into the equation and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues to successfully execute its hardware strategy I believe that it can easily grow from its current levels Last quarter Apples Mac generated more than ten times Surface revenue which is actually quite low considering the life of each lineup and largely due to the Lions share potential that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has In spite of whats said I cant simply recommend buying shares based on Microsofts hardware approach because hardware is a small portion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and shares are trading near alltime highs However its something that investors should keep in mind because hardware is really important so should shares pull back and if Surface revenue continues to grow it could just be one act in favor of buying We only use your contact details to reply to
