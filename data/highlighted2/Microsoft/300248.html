within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article The data shows that mega cap stocks over a long period of time simply get cheaper and underperform The reason for this is probably their large market cap that requires extraordinary amounts of money to move as opposed to smaller cap stocks As such if you decide to buy a mega cap stock make sure dividends and stock repurchases are sufficient for the stock to gain in value I love Apple NASDAQ AAPL I really do I love the iPhone my MacBook and everything that has to do with Apple Hey my first computer was a Macintosh with Meg of RAM back in There is nothing that I can find wrong with Apple Its management the people the way it works thinks and executes And thats the reason why it is the largest market cap company in the world However Apple from now on is on my blacklist as far as investments are concerned According to data from the World Bank current Global GDP stands at around trillion Apples current market cap is about billion So Apple alone is worth about of world GDP Is that a lot Yes it is And the reason in my mind why it is important is because it takes a lot more money to move a stock worth billion than a stock worth billion So my question is is there a relationship between a stocks market cap and global GDP Or even better a relationship between market cap and the GDP of a country I do not have clear cut answer to that however the data I will show you testifies to that there is some sort of relationship As you can see from the chart above Apples market cap on average has been about the same since At the same time however its revenue has been growing And if one looks at its PE ratio it is falling In other words market cap has not been following the fact that Apple is doing so great as a company No matter how much better Apple does the market is not rewarding the stock with a higher on average valuation So the stock just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper as evidenced by a lower PE ratio This disconnect between Apples performance and valuation leads me to suspect it has something with Apples mega market cap status And the reason is simple it takes a lot more money to move Apple than a small cap stock And the money available to move Apple is a function of the money invested in the market and GDP either US GDP or world GDP since Apple is such a global company Which leads me to another theory Is there a market point and beyond market capwise where no matter how great a company does it will underperform I dont know exactly but the data I have been looking at recently suggests there is such a point And if so should investors who want more than a dividend disregard stocks like Apple totally from their portfolios Are there any finance graduate students out there who want to investigate this Guys I am giving you a hell of a thesis here And Apple is not the only example folks there are plenty of stocks that have been underperforming for years and years that belong to the mega market cap category See its not only Apple Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Intel NASDAQ INTC among others share many similar characteristics with Apple And that is while revenue has been going up for many years now the market cap has not followed and the stock just keep getting cheaper as evidenced by the falling PE over the long term on average In fact even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has become more expensive recently as evidenced by its PE ratio of over the very long term it also had a stagnant market cap and has underperformed for the longest time To date Microsofts market cap is still lower than what it was in All the above stocks are not my cup of tea and I would not buy them as longterm investments at this point for trading purposes is another story However everyone is not like me Even if evidence points to that there is some relationship between a companys fundamentals performance and a stagnant market cap over the long term there are still reasons to by the above stocks And those reasons are depicted in the chart below There are only two reasons in my mind to buy any of the stocks mentioned above for longterm purposes The first is the dividend and the second a shrinking float In other words how fast the total number of shares are being reduced via stock repurchases Unless repurchases are large enough in order for the stock to gain in value over the long term chances are that a mega cap stock will go nowhere for years and years But if the dividend satisfies you then there is no problem because thats probably all you are going to get While there is no rule that says mega cap stocks underperform anecdotal evidence suggests that over the long term they do While Apples average price target by analysts is at I doubt the market cap of Apple will increase by much If Apple reaches that target it will be because of stock repurchases and nothing else One other thing when buying mega cap stocks make sure the money returned to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases preferably the second if you ask me is enough for the stock to able to gain in value over the long run otherwise even if the company is doing great chances are the stock will go nowhere Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
