million devices are currently running the OS This is driving positive reports from various supply chain sources which could be indicative of unanticipated sequential growth in laptop units However Microsofts revenue recognition principles have changed which will dampen the immediate impact on revenues in FY Q Im very optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as it trades at a reasonable valuation and has various growth catalysts Momentum is starting to return to Windows as Yusuf Mehdi recently announced in a Twitter post that there are million devices running on Windows Of course users upgrading their operating system from Windows to Windows drove most of this momentum as many did not like the Metro interface of Windows Also many were eagerly anticipating the additional features which explains the rapid adoption of Windows Furthermore chip orders for notebooks are starting to pick up according to a report from Digi Times IC demand for notebooks is picking up and the outlook for replacement demand triggered by Microsofts Windows is more positive according to sources at Taiwanbased PCrelated IC suppliers IC orders for notebooks started to grow in the latter half of third quarter with order visibility becoming clear to the fourth quarter said the sources Judging from orders received thus far in the second half of the sources estimated that notebook shipments worldwide will likely register singledigit sequential growth in the third and fourth quarters of the year Overall this is pretty good news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT as sequential growth is kind of startling given the broader consensus view that inventories on notebooks from prior quarters was high At least according to Hewlett Packard NYSE HPQ PC volumes will take a while to pick up as the release window was relatively short when compared to prior OS transitions However the report from Digi Times contradicts the negative outlook from IDC as IDC stated on Wednesday In addition to economic issues free upgrades of Windows a relative dearth of newer models in the short term and channels that are reluctant to take stock also makes the prospect of growth unlikely through So whos right Well the rapid adoption of Windows paired with the fact that Digi Times does have reliable supply chain sources indicates that there could be some modest acceleration in terms of unit growth in the next quarter or two Also IDC has been known to make inaccurate projections in the past The revenue recognition principle is different between Windows and Windows While Windows generated immediate revenue without any deferred revenue balance Windows will have a deferred revenue balance which will require a number of quarters to pass in order for revenue to fully match the increase in cash Of course financial analysts will be able to discern between next years and prior years comps so the impact on the stock will be relatively minimal so as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is able to demonstrate in their quarterly earnings report acceleration in PC volumes This seems likely based on the earlier reported figures by both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Digi Times The stock is starting to recover following the recent market selloff the underlying fundamentals still seem strong but will require investors to see past the discrepancies in various accounting related charges and changes in revenue recognition principles on a goforward basis That being the case the stock trades at times forward earnings which is somewhat cheap and also pays a dividend yield I anticipate that growth will accelerate due to the revenue mix shift to cloud or annually recurring revenue models growth in gaming and search related revenue recovery in PC volumes and growth in nascent business categories like Azure Therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data
