should do more to leverage its installed base MA activity in has been white hot As I reported a few months ago almost of executives expected to carry out acquisitions this year It is true that the size of the deals in has lagged those of by quite a bit Shires NASDAQ SHPG acquisition of Baxalta for billion the largest deal in so far would have ranked only th in But at least in the tech world

</span>NASDAQ MSFT looking to diversify their business models and reignite top line growth Cutting against the grain is Apple NASDAQ AAPL The company which has recently started to suffer a painful decline in iPhone revenues has not been a big participant in MA activity As the table below illustrates Apple has about as much net cash cash and equivalents minus debt as Alphabet GOOG GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Facebook NASDAQ FB Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and IBM Corp NYSE IBM combined Yet the companys largest acquisition of so far Turi priced at an estimated million dwarfs in size when compared to the MicrosoftLinkedIn billion or even the IBMCleversafe billion deals With Apples hardware sales dwindling see my article on iPads and the graph below on the iPhone sales decline in and other revenue streams having to pick up the slack I believe the company should do more to try and leverage its cash reserves and the sizable iPhone installed base To be fair it is no secret that I have never been a big fan of Twitter NYSE TWTR For a while now I fear for the decline of the companys monthly user base and the stalling of its ARPU average revenue per user My concerns were not eased by the companys most recent earnings release It is also no secret that I would love to see Apple use its huge pile of cash and healthy cash flowgenerating abilities billion in free cash so far in the current fiscal year that ends September to double its dividend payments to shareholders One of Twitters biggest operational problems one that management seems to have already recognized is the platforms lessthanimpressive user experience including confusing names syntax and reply rules or insufficient timeline features that the company expects to address in the near future User experience seems to be exactly the area in which Apple excels the most CEO Tim Cook not for the first time emphasized during the most recent earnings call how iPads have exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement satisfaction rate for the iPad Mini and for the iPad Air according to Research and how JD Power ranked the Apple Watch highest in customer satisfaction among all smartwatches while the iPhone has been fighting a hard battle with Samsung OTCSSNLF devices for customer preference To be fair designing userfriendly hardware versus software likely requires different skill sets But I attribute part of the success of Apples devices to a wellconstructed and intuitive interface At the very least I find it plausible that Apples software design team could very well apply some of its best practices to improve the user experience on the Twitter platform Another common concern that I hear from many Twitter investors pertains to management more specifically to Jack Dorsey After being appointed parttime CEO in October a combination of unimpressive results monthly average users have remained largely flat while GAAP net income margin deteriorated in Q and a declining stock price since October st of last year has ignited a discussion amongst some shareholders about a change in leadership Apple in my view has the scale and the operational diligence that I believe Twitter needs at this pivotal moment in its short life the company was founded in Although many readers might dislike Tim Cook for the visionary that he is not especially in the unfair comparison with his predecessor Steve Jobs Apples current CEO is a pragmatic executor I believe that Twitter at this moment needs more than a user interface revamp and a couple of new platform features It needs a seasoned fully dedicated management team with deeper pockets and the institutional support necessary to give Twitter a better chance at thriving Late last month Apple disclosed the sale of its onebillionth iPhone And according to research firm Gartner iPhones continue to become more popular worldwide now biting off of the smartphone market versus about three years ago So although iPhone sales have started to decline at least for now the Cupertino company should still be able to leverage its large installed base in order to monetize on smartphone usage In fact doing so is what has allowed Apple to grow its services business in YTD despite the drop in iPhone sales over the same period Just like Apple has integrated apps like Numbers Pages and Health into its most recent iOS versions it could do something similar with Twitter The company could include Twitter functionality into Safari or even on the hardware itself similar to how certain TVs and settop boxes have incorporated Netflix and YouTube buttons on their remote controls Although I am not very excited about Twitter for the business that it is today I believe the company can do much better under Apples management Apple has the resources to make the deal happen including the cash or the line of credit to buy the social media company at a price that is not as high as it was a mere year ago when shares traded close to Whether Apple would entertain such a deal remains to be seen Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL CSCO GOOG I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
