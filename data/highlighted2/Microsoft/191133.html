class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Bought A Game Engine From Intel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bought the biggest gamerelated D physics engine company Havok from Intel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is likely fortifying its influence on game publishers and developers Havoks physics engine is far more popular than Nvidias Physx game engine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is not yet buying any Atom x processor from Intel NASDAQ INTC However Nadella did take time to buy games middleware supplier Havok from Intel earlier this week Havok owns the leading realtime physics game engine It competes with Nvidias NASDAQ NVDA PhysX software Financial terms were not disclosed but the buyout price is likely higher than what Intel allegedly paid for Havok which was million in Intels previous takeover of Havok also prompted Nvidia to buy PhysX from AGEIA Technologies Inc in Nvidia should be more concerned now Unlike Intel which doesnt care too much about gaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a lot invested in gamingrelated assets Havoks realtime physics engine is used by console PC and mobile game developers More than game titles use Havok products The latest PS game from Acitivision Blizzard NASDAQ ATVI Shadow of Mordor uses Havoks Physics Cloth Script and Animation products Its not just about owning the best realtime game physics engine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bought an almost allinone game development suite in Havok Microsofts acquisition of Havok could impact other firms like Autodesk NASDAQ ADSK who takes in huge sales from game developers Autodesk sells its own D modellinganimationgame engine package with GAMEWARE The Ambitious Plan Behind The Buyout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said it will continue to license Havok products to other game studios I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>potentially lowering the licensing fees of Havoks software to encourage PCConsoleonly developers to port their games to Windows s platform There is also the chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might even give a free license to mobile developers to use the Havoc Vision Engine to create exclusive games only for Windows Mobile The Havok Vision Engine was originally used for creating iOS and Android games The freemium strategy requires <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to have a lot of topgrossing AndroidiOS games ported to Windows However developers are still not satisfied with the free Project Astoria automatic AndroidToWindows free tool <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>probably expects that giving away expensive game engines and development toolswould finally push Android developers like Supercell to port their billiondollar mobile games to Windows The Havok Vision Engine competes directly with Autodesks new subscriptiononly Stingray game engine The obvious threat to Autodesk is for Nadella to give away free or supercheap licenses just to persuade game developers to support the fledging Windows App Store Autodesk bought the Stingray game engine only last June from Bitsquid Like Autodesk <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apparently also appreciates the great advantage of owning an excellent game development suite There is money to be made in renting software to topgrossing game studios Nadella might still charge a monthly subscription fee for Havok Vision Engine like what Autodesk is doing with Stingrays month plan Havok doesnt have a D modelling software like Autodeskss Maya and D Max However the Havok Animation Studio is one of the best commercial motionbehavioral software for animating characters ingame Autodesk charges month for its DS Max modellinganimation software Surely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will find it reasonable to charge a month for its newlyacquired Havok Animation Studio product The purchase of Havok is a double win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Owning the best game physics engine gives its a lot of clout over Sony NYSE SNE Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY Activision ATVI and other game developers App developers wary of earning the ire of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might eventually find it prudent to finally notice that there is actually a Windows Windows Phone app store The future of video gaming is in mobile More people now have smartphones than those who only have desktop PCs or consoles Windows Mobile will languish as a nonfactor bench player like Windows phone if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt win enough support from the game developers community Sad but true Microsofts decision to give away free Windows Mobile OS is still not enough for it to win the support of game developers Owning something very important toward making great D games now gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a stronger leverage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also stands to gain a new revenue stream through licensing Havoks products Even though there are free alternatives to DS Max Autodesk can still get away with a pricey monthly subscription for its flagship D animation software <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could easily position the Havok Animation Studio as a cheaper alternative to DS Max I rate
