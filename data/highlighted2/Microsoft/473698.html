declines in revenue earnings and especially free cash flow However these weak results were to be expected due to Apples fall product upgrade schedule Meanwhile ecosystem sales continue to soar presenting the company with a clearer forward growth path Continued massive increases in RD spending likely signal new and improved products over the coming year or two that are likely to result in slower but continued growth Which combined with the largest cash return program in history should mean many years of excellent dividend growth and market beating total returns Despite an earnings release that showed yet another quarter of falling revenue and iPhone sales Apple NASDAQ AAPL shares are up over the past two days Lets take a closer look at what Apples latest results mean for longterm dividend growth investors Specifically find out why Wall Street is ignoring what appear to be crummy results and why you should too Most importantly though find out where the future of Apples cash flow and dividend growth will come from and why Apple remains a great buy even after its recent pop At first glance Apples latest quarterly results are ghastly with sales earnings and especially free cash flow falling off a cliff And while the yeartodate results are far better they still represent potentially frightening declines in Apples key hardware markets Fortunately these sales declines were to be expected since Apples refresh cycle is in the fall With a new iPhone and new and improved Macs set to be released soon these kinds of large sales declines largely due to the epic adoption of the iPhone in shouldnt be repeated in The only positive thing in Apples latest earnings report was its impressive growth in ecosystem service sales which were up And with the company recently announcing a historical milestone of one billion iPhones sold investors can likely expect this high margin business segment to continue growing well for many years to come Thats especially true with Apple investing heavily into improving its service offerings including recent additions such as CarPlay Apple Pay and aggressive expansions into music streaming Then theres the heavy spending on Project Titan for which Apple continues to steal key employees from both the automotive and software industries While its far too early to speculate whether or not Apple plans to challenge Tesla NASDAQ TSLA in the premium EV segment at the very least Project Titan seems to be an investment into Apples continued vertical integration of iOS into every aspect of consumers lives such as the home cars as well as cloud based services This increasing focus on software and services which is also being pursued by rival tech firms such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT signals Apples realization that its hardware divisions need strong support While hardware is likely to always represent the core of its sales and cash flow Apple knows its ecosystem needs to be aggressively defended by strong software offerings that keep its customer satisfaction extremely high Consumer technology is an extremely fast paced and ever changing industry which is why Apple isnt resting on its laurels In fact in the past quarter and the first three quarters of fiscal Apple increased its RD spending by and respectively In fact last quarters RD spending was the highest in the companys history More importantly according to CEO Tim Cook The products that are in RD there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping Which means that the new products that investors and Apple critics alike have been clamoring for are likely to launch over the next year or two Combined with fast growing iOS services and joint ventures with Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and IBM NYSE IBM into the enterprise sector Apples future noniPhone cash flow growth is probably due for a pick up over the next few quarters In the meantime the company continues with the largest shareholder capital return program in history AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts With its shares so undervalued Apple is wisely focusing the majority of its billion program on buybacks However dividend investors need to keep in mind that a falling share count means higher FCFshare a lower payout ratio and thus the ability to potentially grow the dividend by double digits for far longer while maintaining strong payout security Despite being a perennially undervalued company Apples recent growth troubles have resulted in shares that are massively undervalued even relative to the low multiples of recent years Which means that even after the post earnings bump Apple shares trade at an attractive price for either starting or adding to ones position Thats especially true given how undervalued the company is on a longer five year and year time horizon For example according to Morningstar Analyst Brian Colello Apple shares are currently undervalued relative to its five year fair value Dont get me wrong no single analyst estimate should be the sole basis for buying a stock However Morningstars conservative longterm fundamentals focused approach to valuing companies means that its intrinsic value estimates are far better than Wall Streets shortterm price targets for determining whether or not various companies are worth buying at current prices For example Mr Colellos valuation model assumes sales decline in and a rise in revenue thanks to the launch of the iPhone More importantly he believes that Apple can maintain around a longterm top line growth rate of based on midsingle digit iPhone growth going forward and continuing strong growth in iOS ecosystem services Regarding Apples industry leading margins his model takes into account gradually falling margins from today to in In addition he factors in operating margins declining from to around due to massively increased RD spending Thats to help continue innovating Apples all important ecosystem including ongoing service improvements in Apple Pay CarPlay and potentially all new product categories such as an electric car via project Titan Its thanks to these reasonable and achievable growth targets that I believe Morningstars five year fair value estimate is reasonably accurate Looking out further to a year time horizon which I think is the longest one can realistically project out for the consumer technology industry I estimate Apples fair value for investors with a year time horizon to be That estimate is based on the latest analyst estimates for Apples shortterm growth a top line growth rate beyond the current decade and a discount rate of equal to the SP s historical return of Now Im the first to admit that all discount cash flow analyses need to be taken with a grain of salt as they are just one data point That being said given that the market is essentially pricing in growth into Apples shares I think its safe to say that longterm investors are likely to beat the market at current prices Thats because as long as Apple can maintain any kind of top and bottom line growth over the next decade its likely to easily beat Wall Streets increasingly low expectations In addition historically a good rule of thumb for projecting longterm total returns is yield dividend growth As you can see while Apples current payout is basically equal to the broader markets analysts expect its dividend to grow far quicker In fact based on the companys track record of dividend hikes thus far as well as its low free cash flow payout ratio I believe Apple can beat the above dividend growth forecast and deliver dividend growth over the next decade Which would mean a projected total return of at todays price far in excess of what this overheated market is likely to be able to deliver over the next decade As a longterm dividend investor Im not so much focused on Apples shortterm results but on its ability to evolve and prosper over the next five and years Which is why I think its important for investors to understand the underlying growth drivers and the risks the company faces over the short medium and longterm In the shortterm Apples sales earnings and cash flow will continue to be dominated by iPhone and thus swing along with the smartphones upgrade cycle With rumors that the iPhone is likely to be another iterative update as the company potentially transitions to a three year upgrade cycle investors need to be prepared for to be another relatively weak year when it comes to sales and earnings growth Which means that Apples shares might remain undervalued until its iTunes and App store sales can scale up to offset weakness in its hardware division Meanwhile Apples mediumterm growth prospects will be dependent on the pipeline of new products and services Tim Cook hinted at during the conference call Which means that Apple bulls will be trusting management to spend all that extra RD money wisely and continue generating strong returns on investor capital Just remember that with the massive scale of its existing sales theres always a chance that whatever Apple has in the works might fail to move the needle in terms of percentage growth Which could mean failure to meet lowered market expectations and stagnating or even slightly contracting valuation multiples Finally for the longest time Apple longs have hung their hopes for strong ongoing top line growth on Apples expansion into emerging markets such as India and China Apples status as an aspirational brand is likely to mean strong absolute sales in these countries thanks to their fast growing middle classes However the risk remains that without sufficient innovation and ecosystem differentiation Apples growth in emerging markets might end up letting down investors After all smartphones tablets and laptops are increasingly becoming commoditized products with fierce competitors such as Xiaomi and Huawei offering far cheaper alternatives to Apples iPhone and iOS The recent massive sales growth of these competing brands shows that Apples biggest longterm risk is failing to win the loyalty of the worlds future tech consumers This is especially true since theres always a chance that consumers in these countries might not be willing to pay the premium Apple demands for its top end products and services Then theres the fact that Apples narrow moat is predicated on moderate though not insurmountable ecosystem switching costs That means that should Apple rest on its laurels when it comes to hardware innovation even its existing base of loyal customers might start to abandon it in the coming years Thats especially true given the levels of competitive pressures in the world of android smartphones With large well capitalized firms such as Samsung Lenovo and LG fiercely competing to differentiate and win customers at the top of the smartphone market Apple needs to stay on its toes lest its phones fall too far behind technologically speaking That would greatly increase the risk of brand deterioration resulting in falling pricing power declining margins and sales growth that misses even far more modest market expectations Like other mature tech companies such as Cisco <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Intel NASDAQ INTC and IBM Apples hypergrowth days are likely behind it However that doesnt mean that Apple cant reward patient longterm dividend investors with solid secure and growing income as well as market beating returns over the coming years The fact is that Apple is in the middle of a transition away from iPhone dominated growth and towards a more diversified business model one focused more on monetizing its already enormous iOS ecosystem That means that growth while likely to continue is likely going to be slower and more volatile Fortunately thanks to its strong brand loyal customer base and massive free cash flow stream that funds a continuous decline in share count Apples dividend growth prospects remain both strong and secure enough to make it one of the best dividend stocks you can buy today Disclosure Iwe have no
