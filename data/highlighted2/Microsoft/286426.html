class='textDiv'>Amazon Creates A World Of Shorts Wayfair NYSEW Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are short W MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Amazon has experienced spectacular growth over the last years by growing from an online bookstore into a technology conglomerate that spans multiple industries When Amazon enters an industry it has used the formula of growing revenue rapidly with losses or slim margins in the hopes of eventually controlling the entire market While Wayfair hopes to mimic Amazons growth strategy it does not have the capital to sustain a multiyear battle against Amazon IKEA and other home furnishing companies The issuance of new equity at Wayfair could come as soon as this year That is the event that will likely send the stock plummeting In the run up to the dotcom bubble burst an online bookstore founded by Jeff Bezos that virtually everyone in America now knows went public in At the IPO price of share and after three stock splits two for splits and one for split investors would have done very well to have bought and held the splitadjusted share stock over the last years At a little over share today that is over profit during this period This represents around per year compounded return over this period Of course the name of this wonderful company that now sports a market cap approaching billion and is widely considered to be one of the most innovative companies in the world is Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Over the years I had considered investing in Amazons money losing or fringe profitable business and always came to the conclusion that the stock was a bit overpriced Every time I would take another look at the situation the stock price had moved up significantly and I would again be wrong about the valuation of the company not being justified by its fundamentals and future growth I was well aware of the transformation of the company from just an online bookstore or online retailer years ago but I kept habitually underestimating the growth of Amazon and its ability to consistently become the top company in every sector it competes in It is quickly becoming a conglomerate that spans retailing of all categories of items cloud computing and streaming video It will almost certainly attempt to enter other sectors in the future and it likely will have a great chance of being disruptive to any industry it touches For the hundredth time it seems I believe Amazon is a bit overpriced at the moment It would not surprise me at all if I am wrong once again Frankly I expect to be wrong After all I am batting so far when it comes to predicting where Amazons stock is headed Because I tend to avoid megacaps Amazon will probably never be a part of my portfolio And frankly if it is a part of your portfolio there are probably better alternatives out in the market today My suggestion is to look at companies that currently compete against Amazon or will potentially compete with Amazon in the future I believe there are many companies who Amazon will eventually crush that will make great shorts and ultimately yield higher returns than buying shares of Amazon today Along with looking at companies that the CFPB Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking at as potential shorts a list of Amazon competitors is one of the best places to begin the search for short candidates While I believe Amazon will negatively impact some fellow megacaps I strongly doubt that it will be able to cripple the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or WalMart NYSE WMT AWS Amazon Web Services has proven to be the top cloud computing firm in the early stages of the growth of the industry and will be a thorn in the side that prevents Microsofts gross margins in this segment to reach astronomical levels Googles executive chairman Eric Schmidt discussed competition to Googles bread and butter search business He suggested that Bing and Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO the number two and three search engines in the United States are not Googles greatest threats Instead Schmidt suggested Amazon is its greatest competitor Schmidt stated People dont think of Amazon as search but if you are looking for something to buy you are more often than not looking for it on Amazon They are obviously more focused on the commerce side of the equation but at their roots they are answering users questions and searches just as we are WalMarts advantage as the worlds largest low cost retailer will be further diminished every year by Amazons growing clout as a retailer and its ability to make the shopping experience as convenient as possible The companies that I believe could be most negatively impacted by Amazon are small and mid cap retailers Brickandmortar electronics retailer Best Buy NYSE BBY mall retailers such as Abercrombie Fitch NYSE ANF and Aeropostale NYSE ARO handmade and vintage items website Etsy NASDAQ ETSY online home furnishings retailers Overstock NASDAQ OSTK and Wayfair NYSE W and numerous others Best Buy has run into trouble over the last few years as it has had difficulty competing against the rapidly growing Amazon With the large overhead expenses associated with running a physical brickandmortar store it is extremely difficult to be cost competitive against the ultra efficient WalMart and online giant Amazon WalMart is efficient and willing to realize slim margins on enormous sales volume WalMart has been the bane of retailers for decades as it has singlehandedly prevented competitors from achieving greater profit margins Amazon is a leaner operating machine than Best Buy The Washingtonbased online giant also benefits from customers using Best Buy as a showroom before ultimately making a purchase at Amazon Best Buys management has done a fairly decent job at combating Amazon with price matching and other initiatives but its a steep uphill battle for Best Buy where there are no simple plans that will lead to sustainable longterm profits For mall retailers it has been a tough couple of years The great downfall of the American mall has gotten significantly worse since Women are spending more time and money shopping online and less time shopping in the mall Take a look at the below chart of the frequency in which women visit malls In the case of teen clothing retailers Abercrombie Fitch and Aeropostale the story gets worse Teens have continuously spent a smaller percentage of their money on clothing since That trend is not going to stop Logobased clothes are in decline and the lean efficient online retailer can further compress margins on clothing by offering similar or identical items at attractive prices The tech savvy teen generation will inevitably gravitate towards online shopping as it has been the way to shop their entire lives The below chart again comes from Piper Jaffray Co Etsy had a nice run as a platform for sellers of handmade and vintage items It was a niche that was small enough to not be on Amazon and eBays NASDAQ EBAY radars However the secret is out that the total addressable market is in the billions and growing Etsy is a moneylosing business despite charging a flat fee for listing items and also charging a percentage of the value of each sale Unlike Etsy Amazon has an incredible war chest of capital that it can deploy to advertise and gain market share If this niche market is as lucrative as Etsy believes it is Amazon could steal a page out of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>playbook when it established Internet Explorer as the dominant web browser over Netscape in the browser wars By making Internet Explorer free and using some of its large cash stockpile to allow for this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cut off Netscapes only revenue stream that eventually led to its demise Netscapes CEO Jim Barksdale prophetically noted in that Very few times in warfare have smaller forces overtaken bigger forces Amazon has shown a willingness to lose money over long stretches of time if the tactic ultimately leads to significantly enhanced market share and an enormous competitive advantage that eventually leads to profits In this battle Etsy is like David in David versus Goliath but Amazon is not Goliath Amazon is more like a large team of highly trained guys from the special forces with modern weapons traveling back to Biblical times to fight David I hold put options in Wayfair currently This is the only company I have mentioned in this article that I have an investment in at the moment I have known about this company well before its IPO and I spent some time thinking about it over the last few months because it is a competitor of Amazon Wayfair believes that the asset light business model is a significant permanent competitive advantage over brickandmortar retailers and traditional online retailers who hold inventory in warehouses I strongly disagree with that idea In the asset light business model Wayfair is able to source product from thousands of suppliers without the need to store inventory in its own warehouses or incur other expenses that most suppliers do Despite having what it believes to be a competitive advantage and revenue that is likely to far exceed billion in the Bostonbased home furnishings company will still not turn a profit over the course of the year This is also in spite of the fact that it is very frequently not the lowest cost seller of an item online When it comes to customer service few ecommerce companies are as good as Amazon If you check online reviews Wayfairs reviews are spotty at best Amazon has the greatest logistics teams ever assembled When you buy a new house or move to a new apartment you frequently get new furniture If you buy a dining table some chairs a desk a bed a couch and a cabinet from Wayfair you will likely pay higher prices on average than if you had purchased the same or identical items from Amazon or another online retailer and someone will have to pay for up to six separate shipping costs if you use Wayfair exclusively The efficiencies of Amazons logistics are completely lost in Wayfairs business model I want to reiterate that Wayfair is still bleeding money at a high rate while not being the lowest cost online retailer and Amazon is likely wavering in the small loss to breakeven range in its furniture business If the online furniture market is as vast as Wayfair seems to believe Amazon can and likely will use the tactics I described above in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>killed Netscape While Amazon cant offer free home furnishings it can further compress gross margins by making prices even more attractive to consumers and keep Wayfair an unprofitable company indefinitely If you buy from IKEA as many low and middle income families do you can get all of your stuff at one place at a lower cost than what you could get at Wayfair for similar items IKEA also pays a little more attention to the safety of its products than Wayfair does IKEA mentions its policies about formaldehyde in Improvement on its website While IKEA is not immune to possible formaldehyde trouble in the future the companys proactive approach on this issue leads me to believe the worlds largest furniture company is much less at risk than its competitors if formaldehyde becomes the next big public health issue Formaldehyde does not pose the same high level of risk as cigarettes or sugary carbonated beverages but the spotlight from an episode of Minutes and the outcry of respected hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson may spark a movement against formaldehyde Tilson has tested the formaldehyde levels of several products purchased from Wayfair and published the results on this site I published a quick article using basic statistics to analyze the results from Tilsons testing There is a very good chance that a large number of MDF mediumdensity fibreboard products on Wayfair containing elevated levels of formaldehyde While some of these same products can also be found on Amazon the reputation damage done to Wayfair if the general public hears the objections of Tilson and other formaldehyde testers will be far worse than what will be done to that of Amazon Amazon has a history of employing customer friendly solutions even if it comes at a hefty expense Even if Wayfair attempts to follow in the footsteps of Amazon on this issue could Wayfair afford to take that sort of large expense Issuing more equity sometime over the next months is a foregone conclusion in my opinion If Wayfair has to refund a significant number of customers who purchased MDF product the timeline of when Wayfair will need to issue more equity will be accelerated greatly In my view that is the event that will wake Wall Street up and send this stock plummeting MasterCard NYSE MA released data suggesting that womens apparel and furniture were winners during this holiday season Wayfair also posted impressive growth during the long weekend that begins on Thanksgiving includes Black Friday and ends after Cyber Monday Despite these positives Wayfair is likely to again combine major revenue growth with net losses again How much revenue does Wayfair need to produce to get to break even for a full year In my view there is no reason to believe the Bostonbased online furnishings company will ever record a profitable year Henry Ford Sam Walton and Bill Gates were among the handful of men who shaped Americas economy in the th century There is no doubt in my mind that Jeff Bezos will be in the small group of executives who have the greatest impact on the lives of Americans in the twentyfirst century Bezos via Amazon has forever changed the way Americans shop and has begun the process of turning cloud computing into something that will eventually be as standard as having Windows installed on a PC Not even UPS NYSE UPS and FedEx NYSE FDX are safe from Amazons dreams of drones delivering goods faster and more cost efficient than any delivery service can today Netflixs streaming video service is clearly in Amazons crosshairs Even Elon Musks SpaceX is not safe from competition from Bezos The Amazon founder also created Blue Origin a company that successfully launched a rocket into space and landed upright back on Earth Jeff Bezos quite simply is everything the Dos Equis man claims to be in advertisements the most interesting man in the world He doesnt always enter new industries but when he does he kills the competition As a result I believe looking at Amazons competition is a great place to search for stocks to consider shorting </div></body></html>
