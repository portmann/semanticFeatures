class='textDiv'>Microsofts Persistence With Surface Will Yield Big Gains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Earlier this week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>introduced the Surface and completely altered the direction that the entrylevel tablet has been going The nonPro Surface is capable of fulfilling the needs of professionals in ways that the iPad cant while costing the same Last quarter Surface made up of Microsofts total revenue but a nifty foundation is being built for the brand to grow When it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT the Surface brand has always been one of my favorite topics because I believe that OEM manufacturers like Dell HP NYSE HPQ Samsung OTC SSNLF and many others are failing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>when attempting to compete with Apple NASDAQ AAPL on anything other than pricing I have covered this in further detail before and concluded that when it comes to personal computing the Surface is Microsofts action against the competition and may as well be vital to the companys future of mobile computing Apple revolutionized the build quality of mobile devices with elegant products and attention to detail and the Surface brand has taught us that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is very capable of competing with the quality seen with MacBooks Microsofts perseverance of the Surface series has begun to pay off with the Surface Pro and Im optimistic about the Surface s ability to lift the companys hardware revenue Last quarter Surface generated billion or approximately of the companys total revenue and Im confident that we will see far greater numbers arrive in both the near and long term The latest iteration brings full computing professional tasking and notetaking in its smallest and most affordable design yet Additionally with the upcoming Windows operating system forming the foundation of Microsofts future products the longterm prospects of Surface are beginning to look very good The most important aspect of the Surface was Microsofts longawaited termination of the ARMbased Windows RT failure which now makes the entrylevel Surface a fullfledged computer This also means that the library of apps has literally increased by millions compared to its predecessor Windows was likely a major motivator for the tablet as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>advertises that Surface owners will receive a free upgrade to the unified operating system Other significant changes include the carryover of the Surface s highquality notetaking pen albeit at an understandable extra This brings me to pricing where the Surface initially passes with flying colors The elegant ultrathin magnesiumhoused tablet that brings a full desktop experience at is great value but I must admit that the terrain gets a bit rough as we go up For users will get a relatively slow Intel Atom processor and a mere GB of RAM which is OK However for an additional GB of RAM and GB of storage users will have to fork up an extra and if you purchase the pen the total will be For an extra buyers could purchase a Surface Pro which includes a larger higherresolution display a pen the same GB of RAM and a far more powerful processor Although this difference isnt terrible it does reflect upon Microsofts illnatured pricing schemes As an example in order to get an extra GB of RAM on the Surface Pro compared to the entrylevel GB version buyers are forced to fork up an extra and simultaneously upgrade their processor and storage for a total of Even Apple let its customers upgrade their MacBook Pros GB of memory to GB for an affordable before the new models defaulted to GB of memory To conclude pricing the Surface at is a spectacular deal and from my personal experience with Surface tablets the flimsy keyboard cover is far from a necessity unless you are typing long documents as the touch keyboard is excellent When it comes to entertainment the Surface brand has a long way to go before it will be able to compete with an iPad thanks to Apples year head start with iPaddedicated apps However when it comes to professional and productivity usage the Surface leaps over the iPad as it delivers the capabilities of a full computer The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office suite comes free for a year and the amount of professional desktop apps available on the Surface far exceed anything that the iPad can deliver at least for now Furthermore the Surface has a notetaking experience that students and artists will find particularly useful The Surface Pro directly targeted the MacBook Air and partially the iPad Air however the Surface is in a great position to compete with the iPad Air and I suspect that many tablet seekers will easily give the Surface their attention Ever since the arrival of the Surface Pro I have become very optimistic toward the future of the brand Microsofts persistence has brought the Surface from a bulky heavy and clunky product to a lightweight thin and elegant Surface With the new MacBook Apple has given us a demonstration of whats possible from Intels latest Core M processors with the new MacBook and I suspect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may use such processors in its upcoming design <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has nothing to say about the upcoming Surface Pro for now but I am pretty confident that its going to be something great In addition to great products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is building a sturdy foundation for the Surface with the upcoming arrival of Windows Windows plans to serve all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Products from the Xbox One Windows Phone Surface Desktops and more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also emphasized that developers will be provided a platform that will allow them to create a single app and watch it seamlessly work across every Windows device This will instantly translate to rapid growth of app development for devices like Windows Phone and Surface which suffer from a lack of developer interest due to its small customer base However Microsofts PC business is huge and if this will be operating on the same platform as its phones and tablets there will likely be a major interest on behalf of developers The Surface had a rough start but its most recent quarter has passed billion and I believe that the tablets are still within its adolescent stages Going forward the Surface is going to build upon itself and bring significant value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which is a new direction for the softwarebased company Apple made nearly billion in revenue last quarter for the iPad alone which is an enormous addressable market for Surface and I expect to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>eat into this revenue following the launch of the Surface The Surface is very important and Microsofts execution is both spot on and exciting Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of
