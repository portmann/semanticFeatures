class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Prefers Apple For Apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha ExCEO Steve Ballmer has complained that Windows needs to be able to run Android apps Porting Android apps to Windows would have been an unqualified disaster for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>appears to be shifting its focus to a much better strategy of giving iOS developers tools for easily creating Windows apps based on their iOS projects At Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT recent annual shareholder meeting the companys biggest shareholder Steve Ballmer also became its most vocal critic One of Ballmers widely reported criticisms is that the companys strategy of universal apps for Windows wont work in his words He claimed that Windows phones need to be able to run Android apps But the company appears to have pulled the plug on its plan to port Android to Windows in order to focus on a parallel effort to port Apple NASDAQ AAPL iOS apps It was at Microsofts Build developer conference that the company unveiled several software bridges for bringing nonnative apps into Windows As nicely summarized in an article in Windows Central the bridge for iOS was called Project Islandwood and the bridge for Android was called Project Astoria The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>even needs to do this underscores the sorry state of the Windows Phone app store compared to its bigger Android and iOS rivals as can be seen in this chart from Statista showing a number of apps as of July The announcements were meant to galvanize developers but in the case of the Android bridge Astoria developers were displeased according to the Windows Central article The reason is that Android apps ran unchanged in an Android emulator which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>called a security container As implemented in early insider builds of Windows Mobile any user could load an Android app downloaded from the Web There were concerns about piracy monetization security as well as the question of why bother developing for Windows at all If Android apps could run unmodified in an emulator there was really no point in developing Windowsspecific versions In fact the promise of running unmodified Android apps in Windows was never fulfilled As the Build conference demo made clear developers were expected to substitute any services provided by Android OS such as mapping and search with the Windows equivalents Now it appears that Astoria is on hold or perhaps dead in the water according to Windows Central The article cites three reasons developer pushback technical problems and potential licensing issues with Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Were committed to offering developers many options to bring their apps to the Windows Platform including bridges available now for Web and iOS and soon Win The Astoria bridge is not ready yet but other tools offer great options for developers For example the iOS bridge enables developers to write a native Windows Universal app According to Windows Central <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has people working on the Android bridge project vs five for iOS Thats probably a fair measure of the relative technical difficulty The approach for iOS apps is completely different iOS apps are written in one of two highlevel programming languages Objective C and Swift Developers who use Objective C can compile their code directly into a native Windows app which can then be monetized on the Windows app store Microsofts Objective C compiler supports most but not all of the iOS APIs I havent tried out the Islandwood tool but at Build the demo of an iOS app running on a Win tablet worked whereas the demo of an Android app on a Windows phone did not Probably theres plenty of work for the developer to do but less than is required for the usual cross platform development Windows and Mac OS X and iOS apps are compiled unlike Android Compilation takes the programming language code and converts it into the binary instructions that a computer understands Once the app is compiled its relatively straightforward for the operating system to feed those instructions into the processor The basic similarities between the app architectures of Windows and iOS makes porting iOS apps much easier to do Android has a completely different app architecture in which an Android Run Time ART takes high level Java and C code and converts it into the binary code the processor understands Each Android app runs in its own instantiation of ART If it sounds cumbersome it is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has probably realized theres no reason to offer developers bridges for both iOS and Android Almost any app that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would want on its app store is already available for iOS That means its either already available for both iOS and Android or iOS exclusively A developer who has both iOS and Android versions doesnt need both tools to port to Windows but only one I doubt there are any developers who have apps for both platforms who would prefer to use the Android version as their vehicle to port to Windows In addition to the technical hurdles of getting an Android Run Time to work in Windows theres the licensing difficulty <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would have to license ART from Google That means paying a royalty fee to Google for every copy of Windows with ART installed Ouch In the case of an iOS app <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is only dealing with the source code generated by the individual developer so no license fee gets paid to Apple If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>decides to extend the bridge to include Swift Swift is now open source The recent open sourcing of Swift may not be a coincidence Apple could very well be trying to do an end run around Google by nudging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>into creating a Swift compiler for Windows as well A port of Android to Windows would have been an unqualified disaster The Androidbased apps would have been buggy unreliable and fraught with security issues Theres every indication that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has dodged this particular bullet and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors can heave a sigh of relief There have been signs lately of a growing rapprochement between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Apple There was the appearance of Microsofts Kirk Konigsbauer to demo the iOS version of Office at Apples September iPhone event And Apples open sourcing of Swift seems almost a plea to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to develop a Swift compiler for Windows Investors in both companies should welcome these developments Enabling easier cross platform development probably serves to increase the developer pool for both companies Sure the companies compete on multiple fronts but their businesses are more complementary than not Apple is stronger in smartphones and tablets while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is stronger in traditional personal computers as well as enterprise services And they both have a common enemy or at least adversary in Alphabet Android has become the pound gorilla in the room and anything Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can do to lessen the reach of that gorilla benefits both companies Based on Microsofts yy revenue and earnings declines in the September quarter I cant really recommend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a buy But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has fielded some good hardware in the latest Surface Pro and Surface Book Coopting iOS apps is a good strategy to beef up the Windows app store <span
