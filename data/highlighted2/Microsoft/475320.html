class='textDiv'>Microsofts Rebirth Could Boost Shares By More Than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts acquisition of LinkedIn for billion is a very good deal Microsofts final exit from its Nokia acquisition will bode well for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT announced its earnings after the market closed on beating consensus estimates by a wide margin Net earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ending in June came in at cents vs consensus estimates of cents and revenues came in at billion vs consensus estimates of billion Shares rose to an intraday high of by July from a close of on July prior to earnings an increase of Prior to earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares had been down yeartodate from their close of on and are subsequently up as of Given Microsofts healthy earnings surprise we believe the stage is set for Microsofts rebirth driven by the end of its exit from its disastrous Nokia acquisition its promising Cloud initiatives and the potential of its LinkedIn NYSE LNKD acquisition Such factors could propel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>higher by an additional for a total of over since July despite choppiness due to macro headwinds Unlike other technology shares for which we have opted to favor a short position primarily due to elevated valuations in the face of macro headwinds such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL Skyworks NASDAQ SWKS and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN we believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is better positioned than most to weather macro headwinds <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>acquired Nokias NYSE NOK phone business in including a license on Nokias patent portfolio for a total of Euros billion about billion Since then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has written off as much as billion related to the transaction while the majority of Nokias original employees that were hired by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are no longer working for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also announced in May the sale of its feature phone business to Foxconn for million Nokias Lumia phone is expected to be phased out while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is concentrating its scaled back efforts on its Surface phone with an enterpriseconsumer driven focus on security manageability and continuum capability The end of the Nokia venture bodes well for Microsofts future as it has inflicted a cost on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>both from a managerial perspective as well as a profitability perspective It is no secret that we have been a strong believer in LinkedIn since when it was trading close to per share as per our article of LinkedIn social media advantages that could boost shares Although during the past several years we have on occasions temporarily reversed position to take advantage of extreme appreciation in LinkedIn shares such as when LinkedIn shares traded at over as per our article of Is it time to sell LinkedIn and buy Facebook we have also ultimately favored reverting back to owning LinkedIn shares following a pullback Ultimately on June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced it planned to acquire LinkedIn for billion or per share We view such an acquisition as an extremely intelligent acquisition both from a timing perspective as well as synergy perspective Prior to the announcement LinkedIn had struggled in monetizing its massive membership base whereby although LinkedIn had secured over million members by the end of Q yet it was only expecting to generate about billion in revenues for this year Whereby Facebook NASDAQ FB which had secured about billion members for the same quarter about four times LinkedIn members is expected to generate billion in revenues for this year times LinkedIns revenues LinkedIn Facebook number of members Source Statista Such underperformance in monetization caused LinkedIn shares to underperform during the past year and provided <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a unique opportunity to acquire LinkedIn at a price substantially below LinkedIns alltime high price of about recorded in February despite <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offering a premium of over to June closing price of Meanwhile we do not believe such revenue growth underperformance by LinkedIn was structural as we continue to believe that LinkedIn is the most promising social network company if properly monetized even more promising than Facebook as per our articles of prior years Our conviction that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had great timing and got a bargain is reinforced by a Business Insider report that Salesforcecom NYSE CRM was willing to pay substantially more than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>paid for LinkedIn It has been revealed that Salesforcecom had actually made an offer equivalent to per share and was willing to go substantially higher while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>got away with paying per share As Business Insider reported After LinkedIn officially announced that it had sold itself to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for billion in cash last month Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff a rival bidder didnt give up right away Instead he sent an email to LinkedIn cofounder and chairman Reid Hoffman and CEO Jeff Weiner that essentially said that he would have been willing to pay much more for LinkedIn had he been given the chance according to documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday From a synergy perspective LinkedIn will further support Microsofts efforts to rebrand itself in MobileSocialCloud LinkedIns vast member base of million users will provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>valuable data to market its products As CIO reported Theyre buying this gold mine of data says Paul Chapman CIO of Box which uses Office Chapman says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>customers will benefit from integration with LinkedIns massive database for building relationships and tracking professionals As the CIO of a cloud software maker Chapman loves the idea of having access to virtually every CIO on the planet and sees opportunities to partner sell to and track people Furthermore as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>integrates its products into various LinkedIn tools <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a good chance to improve participation rates of LinkedIns subscriber base It is currently estimated that only about onefourth of LinekdIns subscriber base logs into the website each month As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO Nadella stated The LinkedIn team has grown a fantastic business centered on connecting the worlds professionals Together we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn as well as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet An improvement in such participation rate would provide LinkedIn the opportunity to increase its revenues from additional page impressions paid services and membership growth LinkedIns improved growth prospects through the acquisition were underlined by LinkedIns Chairman Reid Hoffman as he informed CNBC To reach a lot more people and to grow much more strongly especially internationally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>brings all that From Microsofts perspective we bring a network of individuals that tend to bring productivity to corporations Those two things together make great benefit for the individuals and the corporations and that reflects into kind of a good economic value In its latest earnings report Microsofts revenues were boosted by its cloud initiatives as dynamics products and cloud services revenue grew in constant currency and Office commercial revenue grew by in constant currency Revenue in Intelligent Cloud grew in constant currency to billion while Azure revenue grew in constant currency Enterprise Mobility customers almost doubled year over year to over Commercial cloud products on an annualized basis are at over billion while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is targeting billion by fiscal As stated in the previous section the LinkedIn acquisition is likely to provide further support to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cloud growth As a result we do not believe that Microsofts cents beat of consensus earnings estimates is one of a kind as its cloud services and products remain on an accelerated growth path although it should be noted that about cents of Microsofts earnings were due to a lower than expected tax rate We believe there is a good possibility analysts may ultimately revise their future earnings estimates for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>higher than current levels With consensus earnings estimates of share for this year and share for next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>currently boasts forward PE ratios of and respectively During the past years Microsofts PE ratio TTM has fluctuated between and with a median of However given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now includes a social network of over million members LinkedIn as well as the fast growing cloudbased components such historical comparisons could be misleading Whereas Microsofts forward PE ratio of may seem rich compared to the historical median we believe such factors could justify a forward PE ratio between and for next year while most analysts still have not revised earnings estimates for next year This would imply that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares could appreciate by an additional to from current levels bringing total gains to between and over Microsofts closing price prior to the July earnings release Furthermore on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>completed a bond offering for billion including year bonds at a yield of only in order to help finance its LinkedIn acquisition The yield for such an offering was below its expectations saving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as much as million in interest vs its initial expectations Demand was quite strong as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>received more than billion in orders for its bonds If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had borrowed the entire LinkedIn acquisition cost of billion at even a higher rate of through year bond issuance its annual interest payment would be a constant billion annually for the next years Meanwhile prior to the acquisition and related synergy benefits LinkedIn was expected to generate over million in net earnings in In case LinkedIn grew its profits by a mere annually for the next years we calculated that such a transaction would result in an internal rate of return IRR in excess of faster than the fiveyear average annual rate of at which analysts had been expecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to grow its net earnings Furthermore after year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would generate more in annual net earnings from LinkedIn than it would pay in annual interest payments More strikingly if LinkedIn is able to grow its net earnings by an average of annually for the next years the transaction would yield an internal rate of return of over If we were to capitalize the difference between such and Microsofts rate it would translate to over billion a boost of to Microsofts current market capitalization of billion The objective of the whole exercise of this paragraph and the last one is to demonstrate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>did a very smart transaction given its ability to borrow money at very low rates let alone that Microsofts year bond portion had a lower yield of only about Some readers who have followed our recent articles would notice that we have expressed serious concern lately about macro headwinds opting to favor a short position for the next several months on other technology stocks including Apple Skyworks and Amazon How come we are favoring a long position on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in light of such headwinds Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would also be vulnerable to macro headwinds such as a strong dollar Brexit and political turmoil its growth prospects given the prospects for the Cloud and LinkedIn acquisition relative to its PE ratio and market capitalization is still favorable In the case of Apple and Skyworks their revenues are highly dependent on the smartphone market which has decelerated substantially with resulting declining revenues for Apple Hence any macro headwinds would further curtail consumer spending hence further stressing the smartphone markets prospects Meanwhile in the case of Amazon although it has benefited from Amazon Web Services AWS it is vulnerable due to its excessive forward PE ratio of about for next year along with its massive market capitalization of billion although Microsofts market capitalization is larger than Amazon its forward PE ratio of for next year is substantially lower than Amazon even if such a ratio expands to between and We favor buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares as a result of Microsofts exit from its Nokia acquisition the positive prospects of its LinkedIn acquisition and expected revenue growth from its cloud initiatives Furthermore Microsofts recent ability to borrow almost billion through the issuance of bonds including year bonds at a yield of only and year notes with a yield of only also bodes very well for the company Despite the possibility of macro headwinds and potential related volatility we would still favor establishing such a long position at this time Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MSFT over the next hours I
