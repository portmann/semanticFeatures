class='textDiv'>Microsofts Exit Out Of Display Advertising A Win For Shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is exiting the display business and is gaining search volume from a transaction with AOL This bodes well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as search is a higher margin business and scaling that business is extremely easy given Microsofts expertise in hyper scale cloud The various efforts to improve financial efficiency wont negatively impact growth as the company has demonstrated that it can be disciplined in scaling various businesses without reducing productivity The stock remains a buy as the next fiscal year has positive earnings catalysts the stock is relatively inexpensive and the company pays a reasonable dividend yield for income oriented investors Honestly Im not really surprised that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is exiting out of the display advertising business and who could blame them The company hasnt been able to grow that business unit for years as a new wave of competition came with better adtargeting greater availability of adinventory and more flexibility when it came to conversions In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>overextended into markets that werent a part of its core competencies Looking over the eMarketer table here one can conclude that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>fell behind over the prior three years as its market share declined from to in The declining share and the immaterial amount of revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does generate million explains why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt all that willing to commit more resources to a market that Facebook NASDAQ FB and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL continue to dominate Part of the problem with Microsofts display advertising business is that it doesnt have enough scale in comparison to globally dominant web and mobile platforms like Facebook YouTube Google and Twitter NYSE TWTR Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt have any real cost synergies to make the unit perform better aside from Bing But unlike Bing Microsofts display advertising unit is more labor intensive as its not a selfserve platform Therefore Microsofts decision to completely abandon the market makes sense as its not a rapidly growing unit for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and attempting to compete with Facebook in social networking YouTube in crowd sourced video and Twitter in micro blogging makes zero sense All of these properties have been taken and if you play the game of monopoly long enough you find out that it becomes next to near impossible to buy out other monopolies or expand into parts of the board that have already been taken over The lessons from that board game also translate into the boardrooms of big tech companies too Of course the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>display unit must have some value and Im guessing that instead of shutting the unit down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could turn around and sell the business to a strategic buyer or make a strategic trade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is shutting down its Web display advertising business and handing operations over to AOL Inc and AppNexus Inc a person with knowledge of the matter said About jobs at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will be impacted with some positions to be moved to AOL and AppNexus said the person who asked not to be identified because the deal hasnt yet been announced Some people will be offered other positions at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>while other jobs will be cut the person said Judging by the commentary from Bloomberg they mention that a deal is in the works So its not like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is deriving zero value from exiting the business as AOL has emerged as a key frontrunner to absorbing the company In return <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will be gaining search query share as AOL and various AOL properties will use Bing as the default search engine So if they can create some value from the trade while also lowering operating costs thats a huge win After all Bings costs are more or less fixed and the cost of scaling the business plays into Microsofts core strengths as a nimble data center provider So increasing traffic onto Bing a platform thats easier to manage and has higher margins while spinning off a nonperforming unit sounds overwhelmingly good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shareholders Meanwhile Verizon NYSE VZ will try to use this incremental share in display ads to gain more of a foothold in the digital advertising market The stock has been in a bit of a slump lately which is partially driven by broader selling and continuing uncertainty over interest rates and Greek contagion fear This is reducing confidence in global equity markets Theres also China which has limited impact on US investors but fears of a lending bubble have led to a massive selloff in Chinese equities The weakness in foreign equity markets also has weighed on the performance of US blue chip stocks in recent weeks Despite the weakness in broader macro I believe the underlying fundamentals of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>remain attractive and will withstand the various downward moving forces I also disagree with the comments of fellow SA contributor Brian Nichols Long term I view Microsofts willingness to exit a fast growing billion market as a major problem After all spending on the cloud is forecasted out to where it becomes a billion market according to Forrester Research While large thatll hardly carry the valuation of a billion company If you look at the figure for cloud it would have to be inclusive of various cloudbased apps like mobile apps and nonmobile apps like Office From that context <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>already corners a huge chunk of the global revenue share for various software that run on an annually recurring revenue model like Windows Server for example and Windowsasaservice for commercial clients that want to mass license the Windows OS across a swath of computers So yes the market that was described by Forrester Research is what currently carries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and will continue to carry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>into the future Hence Brians remarks on the topic of cloud are inaccurate because a huge chunk of Microsofts future earnings and revenue growth will come from Azure Windows as a Service Office and various other enterprise apps that will be launched over the next three years or are in the early growth stages like Power Business Intelligence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has already converted many of its commercial clients into an annually recurring revenue model and when you consider that falls under the broad definition of cloud market it becomes easier to understand what company already dominates the cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>This is a market that Apple NASDAQ AAPL has difficulty penetrating into and Google has yet to come up with a licensing or direct sales model that works for its various webbased apps Even bond rating agencies like Microsofts business model more in comparison to the competing alternatives Google and Apple as Microsofts credit rating has the coveted AAA rating All the doom mongers sound either ridiculous or extremely short sighted as Microsofts competitive moat is similar to a highfunctioning oil producer Exxon Mobil and a company that owns a wide spectrum of biomedical and consumer nondurable products Johnson Johnson In other words Microsofts business isnt on the brink of collapse nor is the outward growth trajectory unappealing Sure its recent spree of acquisitions have resulted in some charges on intangible assets but those minor accounting blips should be excluded to smooth out the prior year comps and make current and prior year earnings easier to compare even if it were to be done on a nonGAAP basis From that context <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still doing alright and FY will be better on consumer licensing due to the transition to Windows To conclude Microsofts business is in a solid position and its efforts to reduce the size of nonperforming segments have been interpreted negatively There are very few mature tech companies that can notch respectable top line and bottom line growth rates over a sustained period of time The company also trades at a seemingly reasonable valuation and pays a dividend yield thats competitive to longterm treasury yields Therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on the stock Source Microsofts Exit Out
