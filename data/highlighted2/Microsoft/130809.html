class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Remains A Solid Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported a decent quarter growth will be flat but earnings are still durable The company will gain some tax advantages from its recent restructuring and the recovery in revenue will be driven by high growth businesses and FX stabilization in FY The stock experienced some headwinds throughout FY but the broader weakness in equities were the primary driver for weak YTD performance I still like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>because its a safe technology play trading at a reasonable valuation The management team is conservative and the stock is pretty resilient despite the market environment Following the announcement of earnings the stock has held up quite fine While Im not pessimistic on the companys upcoming fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT needs to develop more efficiency with its RD and look for ways to further expand into software related services The high growth categories will likely offset the decline in consumer licensing revenue and a more normal pattern of growth will likely emerge in FY However theres no denying the company faces key competitive challenges in PCs which will negatively impact the topline growth rate unless if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>were to price more aggressively going forward and mitigate the competitive disadvantages by generating greater productivity in its software design The stock has been surprisingly resilient Assuming the market eventually recovers the stock will likely pickup some momentum going into the back half of the year The day moving average has been providing a lot of support and while Chinese equity markets have continued to roll over I dont think its a precursor to a major selloff where equities on global aggregate underperform I project earnings to be flat in the next quarter but could swing slightly into the positive assuming favorable FX impact and aggressive cost restructuring Reducing cost was the primary theme throughout the conference call as its extremely hard to beat prior year comps unless if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is able to report OpEx at the lowend of the range I anticipate EPS to come in flat yearoveryear The revenue headwinds was mostly due to foreign exchange and partially driven by weaker consumer licensing revenue However the decline in consumer revenue will likely be shored up over the next five years as the company has high growth business units that have reached enough scale to materially impact earnings favorably I think Azure Skype Bing Xbox and Surface will be the primary drivers of growth going forward whereas a mixshift to office will result in shortterm revenue deceleration but will accrue in meaningful revenue once a large enough of a subscriber base is reached I think commercial licensing revenue ie WindowsasaService and Windows Server will continue to grow at perhaps midteen growth rates and other adjacent services for the enterprise will grow at a much higher pace These factors will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to pivot into a growth business following fiscal year as the foreign exchange headwinds are expected to fall in the second half of FY Another saving grace was the companys low effective tax rate which will likely hold up based on their creative tax strategies in foreign markets and their recent billion restructuring charge which will result in a year amortization period in which the effective tax rate will be reduced as costs are going to be inflated by million per year However the GAAP accounting treatment will be recognized in FY Q but the ongoing tax benefits ie the effective tax rate will be lowered for the next years However those same costs are only going to be recognized in FY and will not be carried over into the next fiscal years The company had recorded billion in total restructuring charges in FY so when spread out over years costs are expected to be inflated by around million which will improve net income by million based on my calculation Efficiency has been an ongoing issue The company still outspends many other companies on RD and its not clear whether theyve been able to generate meaningful results with that spending I think a huge component of the RD is being wasted Just how many software engineers do they really need The engineers just make minor adjustments to the user interface and reduce the lines of code needed to execute a command which is important however this could be done with a much leaner organization Sure they could use stronger data security analysts and more white hat hackers to identify holes in the software but when it comes to the actual design of Windows not much has changed and the feature additions have done more harm than good over the years This trend will likely reverse in Windows but going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really needs to refocus the organization away from tweaking the OS to perhaps game development or application development Theres more room for productivity enabling software so building on that breadandbutter franchise is more important than wasting resources on an overly bloated development team in operating systems Apple NASDAQ AAPL is able to get by with a much smaller software deign team while creating relevant features for the average Mac user My guess Apple has a more productive workforce and a better process for getting things from alpha to beta then into full release The window isnt dragged out which forces the teams to quickly develop and implement software as theyre going to be rolled out on an annual cadence versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which rolls out major feature additions every four years The big releases have actually slowed productivity and its why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has looked flat footed since Mac Yosemite and soon to launch El Capitan In other words its hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to compound its knowhow or expertise when theyre not quickly releasing software Theyve needed to transition the commercial business to a cloud business model for quite a while now because now it incentivizes them to quickly release updates rather than bundle updates based on the timing of upgrades The mix shift to other commercial revenue is progressing smoothly so given enough time I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will roll out updates on a quicker cadence which will allow the company to advance its OS much more quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will rely on app store billings to replace some Windows revenue from consumer and will also sell more applications as a part of the Office bundle Of course theyve opted with the price tier strategy in which they only collect licensing on Windows OEMs for devices above a certain price point so theyre already in the early innings of restructuring the business I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had a decent quarter and while the company isnt blowing out Wall Street figures theyre still appeasing shareholders who want a very conservative style of management The companys earnings are very diversified which is why the argument over consumer licensing is moot because its not the biggest segment in terms of revenue and composes about a quarter of all revenue The decline in revenue will likely be mitigated with growth in the remaining segments and when foreign exchange stabilizes the company will begin to report better numbers In light of those factors I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation Its a safe tech stock to hold onto and the dividend yield and valuation are pretty good Source Why <span
