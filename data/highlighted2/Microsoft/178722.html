it INTC and IBM on the same level After Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT dividend increase its yield is now up to par with the technology industrys dividend elite Intel NASDAQ INTC and IBM NYSE IBM With each stock paying a forward yield well in excess of and most investors liking to hold at least one high yield large technology company in their portfolio it might be beneficial to determine which of these three dividend stocks is best to own long term One of the first things dividend investors look at when deciding between two or more longterm dividend investments is the payout ratio This is the percentage of net income that a company pays in dividends and tells investors whether a companys dividend is affordable and whether a company can continue to increase its dividend If you look strictly at the payout ratio you would likely conclude that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made a big mistake in increasing its quarterly dividend Microsofts payout ratio is vs Intel and IBM each with a payout ratio well under each However payout ratios can be very misleading Specifically payout ratios deal with net income and net income takes into account onetime events and does not properly weigh capital expenditures For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported a billion impairment charge related to its Nokia handset acquisition That charge was reported on its income statement against net income but was a onetime event thereby not relevant to whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can afford its dividend long term Thats why its much better to look at a companys dividend payments vs free cash flow a metric of bottom line performance that is much more consistent yeartoyear and accounts for capital expenditures In other words free cash flow is a better reflection of profits thereby telling investors whether a company can afford its dividend As you can see the metrics for dividend payouts are much more aligned when taking into account FCF And clearly it does appear that IBM has the most secure dividend with the highest chances to increase its dividend long term Not to mention IBM also has the highest dividend yield of the three stocks vs on a forward month basis With that said there is one other element to consider and thats buybacks While its not uncommon for large well established tech companies to return of their FCF to shareholders via buybacks and dividends whats important is that companies dont exceed that line So long as they stay under theres still dividend or buyback upside and thats good news if you are a longterm dividend investor MSFT Stock Buybacks TTM data by YCharts With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>spending of its FCF on buybacks and on dividends it returns well over of its FCF to shareholders approximately on a forward looking basis Intel actually spends more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>on dividends and buybacks nearly of FCF While some might be encouraged by this spending I view it as unsustainable and prefer to see companies FCF positive after dividends and buybacks so a companys cash and equivalents can rise or so acquisitions and other investments can be pursued For the longest time IBM spent far more than it could afford on dividends and buybacks combined However it has become far more responsible now spending just of FCF on dividends and buybacks That makes IBM a terrific longterm dividend investment allowing the company significant cash to spend on acquisitions increase its dividend or to make other investments to better its business That said IBM has a complex set of issues surrounding its business having seen its trailing month revenue and FCF decline and respectively since However IBMs declines are starting to stabilize especially FCF which is expected to be flat yearoveryear Thus given IBMs responsible spending and a stock loss over the last year it might just be time to buy IBM for the long haul especially over Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
