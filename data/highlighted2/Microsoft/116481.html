#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha With fewer employees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can restructure the business to be more focused and disciplined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will need to invest in areas outside of its core competencies while trimming the fat off of a nonperforming segment in order to win more mobile share Therefore scaling back and repositioning the business so it can grow organically sounds practical and will likely add some shareholder value Also the goodwill charge was already priced into the stock and partially counteracted the positive momentum that would have resulted from the layoff announcement Im still optimistic though as I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trades at a decent value in the mids Backhalf volume may improve depending on how much inventory was burned in FY Q For the most part Im a huge fan of Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT restructuring announcement and headcount reduction FY was bad anyway so they might as well pile on a couple other things to make next year comps look that much better Some of you will probably chuckle about this because you know what Im talking about For one thing the reduction of job positions is pretty huge Im not sure if the handset segment will do better after cleaning out that many employees however some organizations within a company perform so poorly that you just cant help it you have to send some of them home In a capitalist society your income and expenses have to balance out You cant reward bad behavior with paychecks and pay raises As Jack Welch likes to say you take the bottom and you fire them You take the top and you reward them excessively You take the middle and try to develop them into all stars I think he had different ratios than that but I think you guys get the point A large scale house cleaning was in order and an effort to rebuild the organization from a smaller base is the most practical thing they can do Apple NASDAQ AAPL had to substantially restructure its business in the mid s and bring back the original founder to really get the balls rolling again So your first step is to cut aggressively and try your best to retain the top performing employees Second you gain more nimbleness which is needed to make quicker decisions and more efficiently optimize resources for the few activities that are likely to work Third you identify the core strengths of the business and build the entire organization around that core competency In the case of Lumia I see an organization that has produced way too many handset variations the marketing is off and efforts to rebuild the product have to start with a fresh set of eyes It needs fewer people and not more It needs a strategy that can be executed for marginal gains and not overly aggressive targets that are hoped for by MBAs in one of the finance departments Everything needs to be built from the bottom and from scratch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a really great track record of growing nascent businesses into really huge businesses Its a company that entered into console gaming years later than Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY In the following years it crushed Nintendo and pushed Sony NYSE SNE aside for similar market share figures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is much more profitable from gaming than Sony and while its not always a fan pleaser it treats its shareholders better Its also a company that beat back IBM NYSE IBM in the enterprise while being a smaller company at the time It built out the Office Suite from scratch and that is now the biggest business unit at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>In FY the Office Suite generated billion in revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>knows how to win at business and how to work with smaller organizations before they become big According to Glass Door the average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>salary is K So if we are to assume thats accurate the company could be saving anywhere from million to billion per year from the recent layoff announcement Thats quite a significant figure assuming the company can at least stabilize the handset business so revenues are at least growing at midteen or singledigit rates Of course thats going to be really difficult and we havent seen that happen yet Everyone knows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can create and monetize software like no other company However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will need to hire different people if it wants to build more proprietary hardware inside of its handsets For example Samsung OTCSSNLF technically designs its own app processor memory display battery external casing camera and various other handset components <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>on the other hand has to outsource all of those capabilities so it cant really differentiate Lumia handsets and quite frankly none of the employees at the Lumia division know how to design toptier ICs displays or various other components from scratch So strategically speaking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to develop alternative ways to build a phone from the groundup For the most part the gains from the layoff were netted out by the billion goodwill impairment charge The write down was already built into the stock price as evidenced by the lack of reaction to the news Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has had a rough year due to foreign exchange and falling PC volume So it would have been hard for impairment to cause any additional downward momentum on the stock price I think analysts have modeled in the negative impact from falling earnings and revenue from the handset segment Therefore handset weakness is already built into the stock price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has had a tough year but is attractive at these valuations I think investors should consider buying in the mids as the company is unlikely to get any cheaper Nascent opportunities in enterprise cloud and software paired with potential PC volume recovery in the backhalf of the year may carry the stock price higher Time will tell but I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has hit a wall quite yet Source A Leaner <span
