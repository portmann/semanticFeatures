class='textDiv'>Its A Great Time To Be Invested In The Nasdaq PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF NASDAQQQQ Seeking Alpha Many have predicted that a market crash or recession is coming but we dont believe this to be the case If you sat out because of these fears in February you would have missed out on a gain We expect the bigfive stocks in the QQQ to have a great earnings season This will drag the ETF higher as they represent of the Nasdaq index There has been a lot of doom and gloom surrounding the markets in the lead up to this earnings season Many market commentators have been calling a market crash as inevitable but we dont see it the same way CocaColas NYSE KO earnings may not have been incredibly inspiring on Wednesday but they were far from a catastrophe We also dont believe they are indicative of what we will see from the Nasdaq during the next few weeks It does seem as though every other day there will be someone calling a market crash or a recession A lot of the time it is the same people who have been calling one for months or even years With time on their side they will eventually get the call right just like a broken clock tells the right time twice a day So with all the noise in the markets it can be hard to pluck up the courage to make an investment in the Nasdaq with the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF NASDAQ QQQ But we have and we feel quite confident in it too Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have both been predicting a market crash but of course they would say that We imagine they wish to paint a bleak picture of the current government in the hope of winning the neutrals over So for us this lacks credence Elsewhere Saudi Arabia has been threatening to sell off billion of US assets This is a political threat which many believe to be empty If it did happen it could cause a certain amount of volatility with farreaching consequences But it is likely to also damage its own prospects according to Stratfor energy and technology strategist Matt Bey He has said It hurts them just as much as us With everything they are facing internally theyre not someone who can afford to do something like that So again we dont believe this will happen While we do have concerns over China and its financial markets they seem to have stabilized following the chaos from the start of the year There was of course a reasonably steep fall on the Shanghai Composite on Wednesday that dragged its index below points But no other markets responded to it which was a good sign in our eyes Finally recession talk continues Recent data has been interpreted as an early sign that a recession is coming Although nonfarm payrolls have been impressive there are concerns that below the headline jobs data there are signs that the US labor market is beginning to lose momentum Temporaryhelp employment could be starting to show signs that it is topping out The significance of this is that this type of employment peaked before the last two recessions in the United States Additionally a broad labormarket index that is put together by Federal Reserve economists has now fallen for three months in a row for the first time in almost seven years It is fair to say that a recession is overdue by historic standards but it doesnt necessarily mean there is one coming Investors could sit on the sidelines and wait but during this time they could miss out on some decent returns If investors had been put off by the intense recession talk in JanuaryFebruary they would have missed out on the QQQ putting on strong returns as you can see below So we are not going to be put off by talk of a crash or a recession Nor are we going to be put off by talk of a disappointing earnings season for the big ten stocks in the QQQ As many of you will be aware when it comes to the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF which mirrors the Nasdaq there is a small collection of shares which will generally dictate the direction the ETF and the index take As you might expect Apple NASDAQ AAPL is the biggest contributor with an holding We are especially bullish on Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG and Facebook NASDAQ FB and expect all five companies to beat the market consensus this quarter These five companies including both class A C Alphabet shares account for over of the index A beat by these five will have the power to drag up the index significantly in our opinion We are most excited by the prospect of an Apple beat Apple generally divides opinion but sentiment seems incredibly negative at the moment as though everyone is waiting for them to fail But with Apple Pay Apple Music and the new iPhone reportedly being sold out things are looking quite positive An earnings beat from Apple could drive its share price considerably higher and the QQQ with it Elsewhere we continue to believe Alphabet and Facebook will steal market share away from traditional advertisers The rise of adblocking could be a slight headwind but not enough for us to be overly concerned And we expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Amazon to continue to go from strength to strength thanks to their incredible leadership through Satya Nadella and Jeff Bezos In light of this we are long with the QQQ ETF with a price target of We expect by the end of the year the ETF will have broken through this level returning investors over in the process As far as we are concerned this bull market still has a lot of steam left in it and we would much rather be in it than out of it I
