accompanying Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil Then Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL unveiled the Pixel C an Androidbased in device with a detachable keyboard and a highresolution screen ppi screen Finally on Tuesday saw the release of the muchanticipated Surface Pro from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT as well as the unexpected Surface Book The clear takeaway from all of this is that despite early criticisms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>clearly struck a chord with the Surface devicesparticularly the Surface Pro and the future of computing is looking increasingly like a combination notebooktablet This is ironic in several ways because many people wrote off these in devices as a fad and arguably the in category didnt really exist until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>brought out the Surface But now several years several iterations and several similar competitors later it seems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may have been onto something after all In fact the Surface Pro has done surprisingly well and nearly singledhandedly rescued the clamshell form factor from tabletdominated oblivion Of course I say this despite the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>insists on calling Surface a tablet and refusing to bundle the keyboard that nearly every single Surface purchaser ends up buying and using anyway In practical realworld use however essentially every single Surface Pro Ive ever seen is used like a clamshell notebook with a detachable keyboard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gave people interested in this unique design even more compelling reasons to consider one at their launch event today The new Surface Pro builds on the heritage design and even peripherals of the Surface Pro but adds important extensions of its own First the company reduced the bezel size of the display and increased the screen size from to all while maintaining its aspect ratio As expected the company also updated the Windows only device to Intels NASDAQ INTC th generation core codenamed Skylake CPUs offering variations with a Core M Core i and Core i In addition the company added a redesigned magnetic Surface pen and a Microsoftdesigned IR camera that can do facial recognition for Windows Hello Theres also a new set of improved keyboard options including one with a fingerprint scanner and all of them are backwards compatible with any previous Surface The real surprise of the day however comes from the companys new Surface Bookwhat they call the first Surface notebook Housed in a sleek pound aluminum design the device offers a K resolution display K by K the infrared facial recognition camera the redesigned Surface Pen and Intels latest CPUs In addition however is a detachable metal keyboard that houses an additional battery and optional nVidia GPU The tablet portion of the devicewhich the company claims is the thinnest core i computing device in the worldholds enough battery for hours usage but connected to the keyboard you can get hours as well as access to the optional GPU connected via PCIe over Microsofts proprietary Surface dock connector Pricing starts at for the sleek new device and ranges up over with GPU and highcapacity up to TB solidstate storage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>claims theyre going directly after the MacBook Pros bread and butter audiencecreative types graphics professionals and other highlydemanding users While it remains to be seen how well the new Surface Book does my brief time with the device suggests that PC vendors and Apple have some serious new competition in the more traditional notebook space Given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also used this event to unveil more details about its HoloLens headmounted computer as well as showcase how their new highend Windows Lumia smartphones can function like a PC by connecting directly to an HD monitor or TV and leveraging Bluetooth or USB keyboards this day truly has shown the range to which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is extending the concept of personal computing All told it was an impressive display and one that will likely be looked back on as having started
