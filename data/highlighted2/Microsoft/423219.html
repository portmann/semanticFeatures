behind in AI And it will not catch up in the next few years for several systemic reasons Apple NASDAQ AAPL is years behind Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and others in AI full stop Recently rumors about a Siri software development kit have sparked a debate about Apples plans to compete in machine learning This comes after a series of announcements and product launches from various major technology companies about new languagedriven devices and services eg the Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Echo or Google Home Seeking Alpha contributor Mark Hibben has speculated about Apples capability of closing that gap which he believes is not very large In this article I will give a number of reasons why I believe he is wrong and why Apple is structurally not able to catch up anytime soon First I think there are some inaccuracies in Hibbens piece that I would like to comment on Let me preface a critique with something nice I really enjoy Mr Hibbens Tesla NASDAQ TSLA coverage and I know nobody can be an expert on everything but I think he is wrong here based on my familiarity with the field A one sentence summary of his article would be that Mark Hibben is optimistic about Apple closing the perceived AI gap based on him believing it to be not very large in the first place and second that Apple can easily deal with this by RD acquisitions and so forth In his article he states If it were any other company besides Apple I would probably have bought the argument concerning secrecy But this is Apple Furthermore I doubt that Apples AI activities have attracted much attention from the media We all know Apples just a device company right And what the media want to know is what the next iPhone looks like Its media attention that leads to information leaks out of Apple First I would like to point out that this is Apple is not an argument but pure faith History is littered with companies who seemed like they could do no wrong while they were at the top and no right when something new came along and they did not react in time IBM NYSE IBM was on top before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>came along <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>looked invincible in the s To claim that a single technology company is the permanent historical exception is an unreasonable position and needs more specific arguments why that should be so Second there is the secrecy argument To this I would say that the AI world is not a large anonymous block The community is driven by thought leaders in a few large tech organizations and a number of research clusters It does not go unnoticed when Uber raids the CMU robotics department Facebook NASDAQ FB hires Yann LeCun or Twitter NYSE TWTR Harvards Ryan Adams Yes Apple hires PhD engineers for Siri and acquires some small startups here and there but Apple most definitely does not get any big names in the field on board to take the lead You might think it is not important for Apple to have big names on board but the reason they are big names is that they have demonstrated vision and leadership in the field Others want to work with them Their projects can completely transform a business For instance the team around Jeff Dean at Google has been responsible for MapReduce the Google File system and many other tools that have made Google able scale to billions of users The same Jeff Dean and his Google Brain team have then gone on to the Google Brain project DistBelief and Googles move into deep neural networks now TensorFlow as their general deep learning framework and the Tensor Processing Unit This is what Apple is lacking in softwareAI and it would require a serious concerted effort from top management to lure people like that to the company Right now the only thing Apple can offer is money and I dont think they are focused enough to really go out there and convince someone The founders of Siri have long moved on and founded a new virtual assistant startup vivai which looks technologically much more sophisticated than Siri and I have doubts they would be willing to sell to Apple again Apple has had its own Jeff Dean in product design Jonathan Ive I have been wondering why management has not recognized that it needs to put substantially more effort into finding someone like that for their software side Mr Hibben further contends that Apples gap has mostly to do with search and tries to illustrate it by using Siri versus Google Although Arment may overstate the gap between Apple and its competitors in AI there is a gap and its mostly to do with that key AI function of search Apples search capability just isnt as good as its competitors Well this is sort of like looking at the exhaust of a Ferrari and a Fiat Punto and then concluding that the Fiat must have an exhaust problem but that should be easy to fix because it is just an exhaust after all right First search is actually a task that can be performed well with traditional statistical machine learning it is a combination of information retrieval and probabilistic ranking This is why search could already become a killer application years ago precisely because sophisticated AI was not required Recently deep neural networks have provided us with a general model for nonlinear function approximation inspired by how the brain processes sensory inputs eg in the visual cortex This has also improved applications like search by virtue of recurrent networks being able to capture sentence structures efficiently However this is really just a consequence of the fact that deep neural networks are just very powerful tools in general not that search is a particular AI topic right now Apple is lagging in search because it is lagging in deep learning and that means it is lagging in all areas of AI Let me make this as clear as possible Apple is not just behind a little in one topic of AI Apple is behind in the whole infrastructure management mentality and work environment needed to catch up Apple is the BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY of AI Like BlackBerry did not recognize the value of touch screens soon enough Apple missed out on the importance of the cloud distributed systems infrastructure and data processing tools and then ultimately AI To be competitive in AI today you need a whole infrastructure stack I know I know hundreds of millions of users in the iCloud To that I would respond that the iCloud is technically not particularly hard because its something called an embarrassingly parallel problem the iCloud deals with the data of individuals and user data is completely independent from other users data It is quite literally just a question of setting up more data centers load balancers servers This is nice for Apple because it is easy and nice for its users since they are assured nothing is done with their data On the other hand Apple is now lacking the kind of expertise companies like Google have built over the past decade while analyzing data from all their products and users to improve suggestions Bottom line Apple will not catch up on AI anytime soon A few more Siri engineers cannot compete with thousands of Google or IBM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>engineers who have spent over a decade on building the software infrastructure and doing the research that is finally coming to fruition in the second half of this decade The Siri SDK will very likely be a me too product and I would not be surprised if it is technically inferior to GoogleMicrosoftvivai AI research is at a stage where being competitive requires enormous infrastructure to deal with the data it is not just about the research itself any more Apple will continue to sell their devices and generate handsome profits from them in the coming years but they missed the train on AI and a reality check here is important Even if management completely turned themselves around on the issue and Apple opened up a highprofile research unit that was allowed to publish very important to researchers and had endless resources it would take a couple of years Unfortunately I just dont see Apple doing that If you enjoyed this article scroll up and click on the Follow button next to my name to see updates on my future articles on software machine intelligence and cloud
