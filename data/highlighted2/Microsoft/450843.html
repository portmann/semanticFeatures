style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has announced the official release date for its Minecraftbased movie Movie adaptations of video games have recently become successful such as the Warcraft and Angry Birds films In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT opened its purse and cut a billion check to acquire Mojang the maker of Minecraft Minecraft has resonated exceptionally well with consumers and has sold over million copies in its lifetime The next step for the franchise is to head to Hollywood Mojang announced that it has an official date for the release of its Minecraftbased movie May Mojang is teaming up with Warner Bros and plans to make its film available in D and IMAX The movie will be directed by Rob McElhenney who is best known for his work in Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia From the research Ive conducted it appears the movie will have a feeling akin to that of the Lego movie This is all basic information about the film so lets move into its financial impact This is an interesting time for movie adaptations of video games This segment of films had performed horribly in the past However the box office numbers of Angry Birds and Warcraft based on Activision Blizzards NASDAQ ATVI World of Warcraft demonstrate that these kinds of results could be a thing of the past Angry Birds million budget was justified by a million haul at the box office Warcraft racked up million at the box office so far in an attempt to offset a million production budget The general rule of thumb states that a movie needs to earn x its budget at the box office in order to turn a profit By this measure both of these films have already crossed the threshold of profitability Their success would not be possible without the contribution of China at the box office Out of ticket revenue Angry Birds derived of its revenues from China while Warcraft pulled a whopping from the Middle Kingdom Movie adaptations of video games work by capitalizing on the popularity of the existing game By looking at the Angry Birds and World of Warcrafts subscription numbers compared to their respective box office revenues we can get a crude sense of how the Minecraft movie will perform Angry Birds has million daily players in its app By netting million at the box office this represents an usertorevenue multiple If we multiply this number with the number of Minecraft players we could see a rough box office estimate based off of the Angry Birds movie performance Minecraft has sold million copies but this includes desktop Xbox and app purchases Since many of these are overlapping lets assume that of these purchases are made by unique individuals This gives us an estimate million unique players in the Minecraft network Using this figure we would conservatively reach a box office estimate of million with the Angry Birds model Using this same process with Warcrafts numbers box office numbers would reach million These two figures should serve as a high and low reference point for the Minecraft movie However I am fairly confident that it will be closer to the million total The film wont be released until which gives it ample time to expand its userfan base The Minecraft movie can also learn from the extremely successful marketing tactics used with the Warcraft movie in China Lastly Minecrafts box office numbers were held back by exceptionally poor reviews on Rotten Tomatoes The Minecraft film is a large budget project so I expect production costs to be in the range of to million If this is the case and the rule of thumb is applied the Minecraft movie will be profitable in both of the calculated scenarios This is before merchandising and further game purchases are taken into account All in all I see the Minecraft film venture as a large generator of cash for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Its still a far ways out but I think a reasonable estimate of million at the box office is not unreasonable and will bode very well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>A success from the venture will help to diversify its revenue stream and open a channel of growth that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can capitalize on I encourage you to follow me as I cover a wide variety of current topics with a special interest in the
