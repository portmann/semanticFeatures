With all things considered, this is just an observation, something to think about.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I'm only noting this observation because of the enormous risk that's baked into Amazon.com's stock. (Uncertainty) </span>Seriously, the company added $45 billion in market capitalization without an exceptional quarter from its core e-commerce business or media segment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I suggested back in April, most if not all of Amazon.com's post-earnings gains and short-term gains were immediately tied to AWS . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a result, if the second quarter reflects the slowdown that I expect, and analysts have been doing nothing except upping earnings estimates and price targets, then AMZN could be poised for rather substantial stock losses. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore, if you are bullish on Amazon.com and AWS long term, like I am, it might be good to take some profits, cut the position, and maybe buy back later. (Uncertainty) </span>In retrospect, it's never a bad idea to take a profit.Source: More Proof That AWS Will Struggle In Amazon.com's Earnings Report Tomorrow Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
