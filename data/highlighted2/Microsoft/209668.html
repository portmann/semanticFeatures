class='textDiv'>Can The Battle Between Shorts And Longs On Sphere D Be Settled Once And For All Sphere D Corp NASDAQANY Seeking Alpha Sphere D is a battleground stock between investors with firm convictions on both the long and the short side Many of the developments are interpreted rather differently by both sides Sphere D NASDAQ ANY is an amalgamation of different companies The original Sphere D providing a virtualization platform called Glassware and V a desktop virtualization provider Overland and its takeover Tandberg traditional storage solution companies Sphere D is a hotly contested stock by both bulls and bears and each side has considerable ammunition in the battle for supremacy The shorts think putting four losing companies together cannot amount to much and the longs see Glassware the virtualization solution from Sphere as the next big thing in virtualization Its not unusual that some of the developments are interpreted quite differently by longs and shorts for instance Where shorts see continuing losses cash bleed and significant dilution the longs see the building of a base cost savings and the making of a turnaround Where the shorts see isolated deals in the education and healthcare sector the longs see a host of partner and distribution deals laying the framework for a dramatic rampup in sales and possible ubiquitous presence for Glassware Where the longs see a strategic partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT the longs see this deal as Sphere being a customer of Microsofts Azure having to bring its own customers to the platform Where the longs see market manipulation wash trades and naked shorts the longs see just market activity reflecting investor skepticism Is there any way we can settle this debate At the end of last year and beginning of this year there was a flurry of deals and it seemed like the long case for Sphere was winning investors over However since then the flurry has almost dried up and promises about a turnaround at Overland the storage company that Sphere D took over at the end of last year havent materialized Quite the contrary sales have kept on declining and losses havent diminished raising the specter of significant new financing There have been several private placements and there is a recent shelf registration already This has been reflected in the share price As you can see clearly in the weekly chart its dominated by lower highs and lower lows This isnt the only negative So far there is no sign of Glassware Central to Spheres value proposition is registering sales of any significance at least not in the financial statements up until the second quarter Equally worrying is the lack of ICT press coverage of what Sphere claims is a rival containerization solution to the much more wellknown Docker We have consistently called the Glassware technology promising We are fairly sure that Glassware at the minimum is very useful technology and we wouldnt discard the possibility that it can be something very significant This is panned out by a few public reviews by customers or tech experts such as from Novarad Caney public schools and Simon Bramfitt an ICT expert who is now CTO at Sphere Were also fairly sure that some of the longs have a better grip on what the technology can do simply because they have better access to the company So our base case on Glassware is that at the minimum its competent tech and it could have the potential to be something considerably bigger which is what the longs bank on and is absolutely crucial for their case Can this be settled On the one hand Glassware has seen some take up but the main deal with medical imaging company Novorad is already more than a year old and generated some positive noise from Novorad customers Theres also a recent deal with another although related medical image company iPro and there is a deal with New Caney a school district But none of these deals have yet resulted in significant financial results Since these are mostly master agreements none were expected for now The hopes of longs have been pinned to a significant extent on a deal with Microsofts cloud platform Azure The shorts see nothing special in this virtually any party can use that platform to partner as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will be happy to host all kinds of applications that can boost its sales on Azure The longs argue that there is something more substantial going on here Cormark research noted the following after a presentation from Larry Orecklin VP at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Specifically Mr Orecklin highlighted the use of Spheres technology in extending the capabilities of the Azure platform that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>otherwise could not do on its own particularly on enabling the hybrid cloud model whether it be onpremise in the cloud or some combination of both with scalability being one of the key benefits Recently Glassware is available on the Azure platform and the announcement on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>event calendar for a presentation on October argued the following lower TCO Mobilize your workforce on any device with a cloudbased application delivery infrastructure with drastically lower TCO compared to existing solutions on MS Azure Virtualize apps in minutes Virtualize production applications including legacy business applications in minutes More application sessions per Azure VM Drastic ROI benefit from high application session density per <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Azure VM compared to standard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Remote Desktop Services RDS solutions x faster data mobility Increase collaboration and security for BYOD initiatives with secure global data access sync and share capabilities up to x faster than Dropbox Your virtual datacenter in the cloud Drastically lower operational costs with single pane of glass central management of the hybrid cloud infrastructure ranging from remote offices and central data centers to public cloud instances Now while this was on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>website its not clear at least not to us whether this comes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or from Sphere D itself But it should be clear that if these claims were vetted by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>andor can be verified independently the whole shortlong debate will be settled in a rather emphatic fashion Theres little doubt that there is a significant market opportunity for legacy applications and organizations that want to move to the cloud whether private public or hybrid Containers see here for a useful technical introduction threaten to upstage older virtualization solutions like hypervisors Dockers provides the most wellknown container solution However its a Linux solution A constraint of containers is that you cannot mix and match operating systems In the world of virtual machines its quite usual to have a Windows host support a virtual machine running Linux or an OSX system running a Windows VM Not so with containers because by definition a container uses the host kernel Thus you need to match up operating systems Linux containers run on Linux hosts You can run Windows containers on Windows Server as of Windows Server This could provide a significant advantage for Glassware Though the industry has been abuzz with the premise that Linux containers are the new and efficient way to deliver application virtualization its often missed that these Linux containers do not apply to the majority of Windows based applications that are in production in corporate IT infrastructures around the world However Docker seems to have a way around this Because the Docker daemon uses Linuxspecific kernel features you cant run Docker natively in Windows Instead you must use dockermachine to create and attach to a Docker VM on your machine This VM hosts Docker for you on your Windows system The Docker VM is a lightweight Linux virtual machine made specifically to run the Docker daemon on Windows The VirtualBox VM runs completely from RAM is a small MB download and boots in approximately s The upshot is simply this Containers are here to stay and they face a large market opportunity Whether Spheres Glassware is able to tap into this opportunity in a significant way depends largely on whether the claims as presented above about its simplicity and economics pan out Many longs seem to think that this debate is already settled in their favor largely it seems to us on the basis of private demonstrations We surely hope they are right But for us it still needs some of the above public demonstrations An independent benchmarking effort could be especially useful
