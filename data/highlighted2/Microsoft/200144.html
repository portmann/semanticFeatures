Handmade is Amazons response to the rise of handcrafted goods sales Last week Amazon NASDAQ AMZN introduced new initiatives aimed to strengthen its core businesses in its marketplaces and AWS segments These new initiatives allow Amazon to offer new platforms and solutions that until recently were only available via its competitors or partners By launching this new initiative Amazon strives to expand its portfolio in each segment and offer a more comprehensive solution than it previously had In the marketplace segment Amazon launched Amazon Handmade an Etsy NASDAQ ETSY like platform that allows small merchants and individuals to offer handcrafted goods and provides a decent alternative to Etsy Merchants using Etsys seller services such as Direct Checkout could use Amazon Payments and other Amazon seller services to replace Etsys services Once Amazon announced its Amazon Handmade initiative many Etsy shareholders rushed to liquidate their positions driving the stock lower and seeing a more than drop from its IPO debut share price of In Etsys revenues were split almost equally between marketplace revenues generated by transaction and listing fees and seller service revenues which are generated mainly from promoted listings wholesale enrollment fees and payment processing fees As shown in chart below Etsy generated million in revenues in and in the company is on track to cross that line and generate around million annually Amazons new handmade initiatives will impact Etsys growth Even though its too early to determine how much damage Amazon Handmade will cause to Etsy Amazons benefits are almost immediate as merchants will use it at the beginning as a second selling point and might move their business there at a later time Maybe Amazons most exciting announcement last week was made during the reInvest conference about AWSs new initiatives Amazon launched a number of new products but I want to mention only two Amazon QuickSight and AWS IoT Amazon QuickSight is a bigdata analytics and visualization tool that allows companies that already use AWS to quickly analyze their data using a native builtin app without the need to spend time on preparing the data modeling it and estimating what an initial report will look like Currently most this market is dominated by Tableau NYSE DATA and Qlik NASDAQ QLIK which partner with AWS to offer an AWS addin that provides the required analytics and visualization needs Amazon QuickSight is actually Amazons first attempt to penetrate the emerging market of streaming big data analytics and compete directly with two leading big data pureplay companies This new initiative was a move that Amazon probably should have made earlier and it makes perfect sense businesswise If Amazon offers its AWS customers a complementary highquality data analytics and visualization tool that enables them to save costs on external solutions more customers will prefer Amazons solution over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL In the short term I believe many customers will prefer using Amazons complementary solution which will save them time and effort over contacting a thirdparty vendor such as Tableau or Qlik This might be true for startups and small corporations that store all their data in AWS However bigger companies using multiple IaaS vendors or a combination of onpremise and online storage will still require a more comprehensive solution In these cases Tableau and Qlik will be used However in the long run I believe Amazon will enhance its QuickSight capabilities with additional features and functions and with a quality sales team Amazon could attract more corporations to import their onpremise or Azure data into AWS The second exciting AWS initiative also touches a steaming hot market Internet of Things IoT AWS launched two new products in the IoT market Amazon Kinesis Firehose and AWS IoT The underlying assumption in the IoT market is that all computing devices such as smart TVs tablets smart watches smart glasses wearables etc are connected and share information online in real time To enable that a user needs the ability to receive live data from multiple connected devices analyze it and quickly translate it to the required outcome as presented in the example below AWS IoT enables users to connect many devices to AWS and gather information in a secured encrypted onestopshop for online data To make this possible Amazon launched a complementary service named Amazon Kinesis Firehose which is an advanced data pipe that allows users to load live streaming data into AWS in real time and enables realtime analytics Both of these tools the Kinesis Firehose and AWS IoT improve the IoT infrastructure and enable the IoT market After years of looking for new adventures outside of Amazons natural core business the company has launched a number of new initiatives that are targeted to strengthen its core business and drive growth in the marketplace and AWS segments The new products answer users demand allow Amazon to extend its existing offering and address some of the hottest emerging trends eg handcrafted goods sales big data analytics and visualization and IoT These new initiatives are a very positive signal from Amazon which is proactively going after new revenue streams In the longrun I believe these initiatives will serve as a catalyst for Amazons revenues and drive up the stock price However before quantifying their impact I would be interested to see users
