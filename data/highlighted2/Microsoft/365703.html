Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Build developer conference showed multiple new paths suitable to build up the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ecosystem Xamarin Xbox devkit mode Desktop Converter and Bash implementation are all great features for the Windows environment Remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is going to release SQL for Linux in while Office and Azure are delivering great results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has managed to upgrade M of devices within the first months and it is going to release the Anniversary Update this summer for free <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel are likely to benefit from the release of Surface Phone in and Desktop Converter They are a buy The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Build event March April has shown how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is working hard on the entire ecosystem accelerating and widening the development on multiple aspects Xbox Windows Windows Mobile Linux SQL PCs Continuum Office and Azure are all core aspects of Microsofts path which looks very promising In addition even if Terry Myersons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group declarations are not so positive for Windows smartphone development in this topic needs some insight to better grasp the possible roadmap But stay assured that Windows Mobile development is not dead at all Anyway a very important topic regards Linux in particular the Bash shell that surprised developers at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Build Considering a lot of other new features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is willing to attract more and more developers in order to greatly improve its still not complete Windows Store its Achilles heel And it may have found the right path <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has already reported that SQL will be released for the Linux environment next year opening a new profit window it is likely that there is a group of Linux powered companies that needprefer the SQL platform or it is highly possible that some companies want to ditch Windows while remaining loyal to the platform In any case that announcement was surprising but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has made another surprising move on the first Build day Windows will support the Bash shell The Bash is a textual GNU shell used under Linux for example Ubuntu and it is going to be natively implemented into Windows I must underline that this is a genuine Linux image provided by Canonical Ubuntu that runs on a Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL this will not be a virtualization or other halfservice implementation A lot of developers will be able to exploit the open source shell and command language directly from Windows using native APIs EXT file system and there will be VT and SHH support under Windows skin Believe me this is a very interesting move from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>since the Ubuntu image is not a recompiled one but a native image this means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has the potential to run tons of Linux apps from its WSL creating a new florid and multiuse developing environment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has announced a couple of interesting things regarding Xbox first the Xbox One and future Xbox devices Preview program will be integrated with the Windows Insider program reducing the Windows development dispersivity Most important <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced that Windows Anniversary the upcoming summer update will enable retail Xbox consoles to become developers kit Xbox consoles just with a setting change This is extremely important for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>entertainment market because it will enable a lot more developers to develop on Redmonds consoles the actual devkit request procedure is a little complex and it may help developers to shape games in a more uniform way across Windows and Xbox During the first keynote Satya Nadella <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO and Terry Myerson shared some statistics about Windows adoption after months from its release Windows is powering more than M devices around the world delivering the best adoption rate in Microsofts OS history For comparison Windows was adopted for M devices and Windows for M devices during the same time frame It is obvious that the year free upgrade strategy is the main cause of this great performance but such an adoption rate is still really remarkable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>targets B devices within years from the release and it is a highly feasible target at this point Such an adoption rate generates a higher potential use of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>related services through Cortana Bing Office One Drive and other cloud services and so on At the same time in devices are sustaining PC sales with correlated OEM agreements that bring additional revenues to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is able to spread Windows the higher is the chance to make additional revenues and profits from the Windows ecosystem I personally consider M devices within months a great mark Considering also that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has reached B of Office users it makes clear how the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ecosystem is growing fast However the first issue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will have to face will be the end of the free upgrade period at the end of July the free upgrade wont be available anymore and the Windows sales will probably decrease anyway a deceleration would be physiological through time However we have to consider that business and enterprise upgrades are going to ramp up during this year and that the Anniversary Edition major upgrade will be free and available this summer Anniversary Edition is a major update similar to that will bring a lot of additional and interesting features A notification center that will be able to synchronize every device connected to a single account even on Android and it will implement also widgets and live tiles inside Double processes are required no more to run background applications This implies great easiness of application development and better performance The Universal Windows Platform will support extensions for the apps implying that every Universal App will be able to have an internal ecosystem Windows Edge will be the first application to implement it New instrument sets for Windows developers and Feedbacks Handofflike features it will be possible to continue with an app on a different device from the same ending point Office will be the first example and it is to be seen if handofflike phone calls feature will be wholly implemented or if it will be relegated to Continuum connected devices Such set of features is obviously highly intriguing and attractive since it makes Windows a more advanced and productive ecosystem for developers consumers business and enterprise users In particular consumers and business users will be very interested in the new Notification Center the extension platform and the handofflike feature Redstone will likely be sufficient to sustain the month Windows adoption rate at interesting levels The browser has always been a fundamental part positive and negative of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows OS Windows Edge is essentially a big improvement and it delivers fast web surfing reliability compatibility and very low power consumption it generally consumes a lot less than Firefox and Chrome with the same web surfing script tests With the major update and through the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Edge will earn an extension ecosystem providing Ad Blocker Amazon OneNote LastPass and Evernote as the first extensions In addition Edge extensions will be able to communicate with Windows native apps with users permissions There will be the biometric and the Real Sense authentication integration in order to access web sites typing passwords no more Edge will be featured with new touch gestures Ad Blocker and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Translator will be integrated I think that advanced authentication and extension availability will be attractive for both business and consumers in particular Ad Blocker integration will be welcome Lets talk about the mobile sector now Continuum will be highly enhanced with the upcoming major update getting various and different features that will make it more polyvalent Continuum will finally support the Xbox controller connected to the dock While it is still unknown if the support will be available also through WiFi this feature transforms the Continuum devices into small portable consoles for the joy of mobile gamers and emulators Continuum will be able to target an existent PC Actually Continuum needs a combination of free to use devices monitor mouse keyboard to be connected through the dock in order to use Continuum But with the major update it will be possible to simply use Continuum directly on your desktop tablet or laptop using the monitor keyboard and mouse connected to your existent device while the smartphone will be available to be used from the PC the smartphone will be mirrored under a window or directly from its touchscreen It is a very sensible feature because it is easier to find a complete PC at home or at the office instead of lone peripherics and the suitable dock or miracast display the availability of compatible devices becomes massive Handofflike features As I have already mentioned it will be possible to resume an activity on a device right away from where we finished on a different one In particular it has been confirmed that it will be possible to transfer a phone call on the PC through continuum but it is still unknown if the feature will work on WiFi Considering also the beefed up notification center it is clear that Windows Mobile will become more productive and interesting thanks to these and other additional features But still we have to face the apps availability issue On th February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced that it would acquire Xamarin The acquisition was very interesting from the developer point of view but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>decided to raise the bar and release it for free even to the holders of Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise versions This is a key developer tool for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Xamarin simply enables developers to take full advantage of Net code use C to build various APIs build a common code and use it to create native apps for iOS Android and Windows This is a powerful instrument for developers since they will be able to use a single language C in order to write a single common code to be shared across three different platforms The fact that it will be free for paying users is extremely important and farsighted In addition the runtime the SDK and the command line instrument will be made open source But this is not enough the company decided to release its Desktop Converter which is the result of Project Centennial this application is the key component of Project Centennial toolkit and it will enable developers to convert Win and Net x applications to Universal Applications There are more than M x applications with the potential to be converted and released in the Windows App Store In that way the application environment will be more solid controlled verified and secure and it will be possible to run traditional x applications even on Windows x smartphones sensibly in Continuum mode In addition for less famous companies and applications the use of a unified store will be a possible source of higher media exposure The Desktop Converter needs a little insight the eventual conversion of a Win or Net app may happen as a full conversion or a partial conversion A partial conversion has two packages a Universal Windows App UWA and a Classic Windows App CWA The UWA can act with a universal interface maybe in a reduced visualization for simple tasks while the CWA remains practically the old application that runs at full thrust once a display is connected In this way developers will likely quickly convert traditional apps once the Surface Phone lineup will be released without the need of an immediate full conversion Thanks to the chance of an hybrid conversion beyond the full one I expect developers to enjoy Project Centennial But something sounded alarming and pessimistic during the Build Myerson said that Windows Mobile will soon be the focus of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>strategy it is part of the family right now but it is not the sector where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to attract the most of developers attention during Beefed up Continuum with PC as a target device Desktop Converter for Win and Net applications The majority of these features have been announced and demonstrated in successive handson sessions this practical approach tells us that Windows Mobile is not the main focus for but the number of features for Windows Mobile and its developers is staggering and it demonstrates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still considering this business a very important one There are many irons on the fire and this is fundamental I think that Myersons declaration regards more what is happening right now on Windows Mobile update and development Windows Mobile was set to be released in October but the update has been released only in Q and not for all the forecasted devices In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has already said that it wants to produce fewer smartphones and that it prefers to let OEMs use Windows Mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has already released the business Lumia and we will probably have to wait the following Fall in order to see something new There have been also rumors stating that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is willing to completely detach from Lumia production and to concentrate only on developing the Surface line with the so desired Surface Phone and Surface Mini eventually but Myersons declaration sounds more like there will be no further device this year It may be true but in my opinion his declaration essentially regards the Lumia and classic smartphone market and this would comply with recent rumors On the other hand the Surface Phone would partially break away from the traditional concept of smartphone it would be a mobile pocket PC able to run Win and Net apps under the form of Universal Applications and that is really different from Android iOS or a simple Windows Mobile It wouldnt be a simple smartphone but a Surface device Obviously a Surface Phone may arrive in early and not in late depending on the actual development level and also depending on Intel NASDAQ INTC products Intel is expected to release the new Broxton platform with Goldmont cores at nm in Q but it is also possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will wait for the next iteration at nm in order to lower further the power consumption In any case if it will not be released in will be the right year the management has commented too many times about the will of producing a smartphone Surface Phone consistent with Surface philosophy therefore it cannot be too far I consider Myersons declaration nothing to be worried about at all moreover consider Nadellas latest interview at Business Insider During the interview I noticed three particular concepts exposed by Nadella first of all he refers to Windows as a single operative system or ecosystem meaning that the mobile aspect grows in synergy with the entire system This is a very important point because we can expect continuous development from this point of view and this is proved by the irons on fire with Continuum notification center Cortana Desktop Converter and Xamarin Then he stated that it sees Continuum as the unique and really distinctive feature of Windows Mobile in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to create another class of devices where the smartphone acts like a PC once it is connected to a PC or a monitor Like it did with the in devices it wants to create a new and peculiar market The Surface Phone or similar products that are able to exploit the converted Universal Apps and Desktop Converted Win and Net applications That is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is probably heading to Another important part of the interview regards India Nadella says that India is essentially a mobilefirst nation more than B people and like every emerging nation it will need more and more computational power and productivity products PCs and sort of as the nation grows In his opinion Continuum would be the perfect evolution suited to improve their productivity starting from the mobile sector I think that the plan is essentially correct Continuum could be a killer feature in that nation Considering also that India is likely to become the new Chinese market for what regards growth and population I think that this is a very important market to monitor and eventually attack There is a fresh rumor stating that three Surface Phones will come in early probably during the first months concomitant to the second part of the major update Redstone The rumor is sensible most of all because the Surface Phone would perfectly exploit Redstone and the fact that Intels Kaby Lake availability wont be so high in late In addition it is sensible to think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would prefer to wait a little more than last year in order to release more hardwaresoftware optimized devices and avoid Skylakelike issues as it happened with Surface Pro It is to be seen if the Surface Phone will adopt a sort of Core M or a Broxton SoC Anyway even if they were to adopt a Broxton platform the Surface Phone are likely to be released in early in order to greatly optimize the product to be released together with the Surface lineup In addition Broxton is expected to be released not before Q Note about Broxton since Broxton is expected to be released in Q it looks like it is a derivative of Kaby Lake architecture This would be interesting because it would mean that the Z class SoCs Z class is used for smartphonetablets are finally on par with the YUSK classes Core M and Core iX used in laptops desktops in NUCs and so on Office and Azure are delivering great results instead Office is used by B single users and is adopted by of the Fortune companies while the mobile downloads have gone beyond M new companies subscribe to Office every month while several billion hours per day are spent on Skype and multibillion emails are sent every day on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>platform This is an outstanding success for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which has been able to build a solid and spreading cloud Office Even Azure is going very good being used by of the Fortune companies with new subscriptions per month M entities use Active Directory and more than M developers already use Team Services of Visual Studio Even Toyota has just announced that its connected services will be Azure powered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is admirably delivering in the cloud computing and services and it has a bright future of profits and revenues ahead The resume is Cloud is bright Azure is bright Office is bright Continuum is beefed up Desktop Converter has an enormous potential Linux under Windows skin is revolutionary and very intriguing three Surface Phones or variants are coming in late or early and Xamarin targets a complete development field The main negative point for Windows Mobile and Windows is the lack of a high number and high quality number of apps on the store but recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been able to add more than apps during the last three months and this has happened without the latest announced features Bash Linux under Windows skin Xamarin under Visual Studio and the Desktop Converter for Project Centennial are likely to greatly improve Windows Store situation Once all these features will be available and working at regime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will push OEMs to build Windows smartphones and it will also release the Surface Phone x powered lineup <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is shaping a powerful ecosystem centered on its OS and Cloud system and the strategy is working extremely well The mobile counterpart will not delay for so long and it will improve Windows adoption and its related services The India market is the most promising for the coming years and it is the most suitable nation to see an effective use of Continuum in the future Surface Phone may drive a new market like Surface lineup did with the in devices while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is working hard on building the most effective ecosystem to support it Intel Corporation is obviously the most important supplier that may benefit from this kind of devices Surface Phone would be x powered probably by Broxton or Core M SoCs or similar and it would provide a fantastic entry point for Intel Intel has always failed to attract customers in the mobile market but now it is developing the interesting SoFIA LTE and SoFIA LTE platform to attract customers in the low and mid end market If it will be able to put its future highend SoCs into a tier product the path for a consistent market share increase would easily open The fact that it has probably won a part of the future modem supply for Apple NASDAQ AAPL devices it is something that makes brighter its future in the mobile sector On the contrary Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM may even suffer the eventual Intels rise in the mobile sector not to mention the increasing lawsuits for unfair competition Obviously Intel has a lot of other sectors where it is set to generate additional revenues and profits like SSD Octane D Xpoint FPGA processors Cloud and Virtualization HPC and Data Servers Are we back to Wintel consortium Yes and it looks solid and promising I consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel a buy with a long term expectation even at these levels Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MSFT INTC over the next hours I wrote this
