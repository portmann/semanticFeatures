a long time because according to a just released report in Japan s Nikkei Apple will continue its reduced production of iPhones in the AprilJune period in light of sluggish sales according to parts suppliers notified of the plan The website reports that slow sales of the flagship iPhone s and iPhone s Plus which debuted last autumn have forced Apple to adjust inventories It lowered production for the JanuaryMarch quarter by about from the yearearlier period With sales still sluggish the US company has told parts suppliers in Japan and elsewhere that it will maintain the reduced output level in the current quarter Apple apparently does not plan to produce a large enough volume of the small iPhone SE released last month to offset the slump of its flagship series However should Apple decide to release its next flagship model earlier than the usual September launch parts production for that smartphone could take off around late May A prolonged production cut would hurt Japanese parts suppliers such as liquid crystal display panel manufacturers Japan Display and Sharp memory chip supplier Toshiba and Sony which provides image sensors for cameras With their plants already operating at reduced rates they may be forced to downgrade their earnings forecasts for the AprilJune quarter The current production cut could last longer than the one Apple implemented in Some billion smartphones are shipped globally in a year but the markets growth is slowing Fri buzzsaw Fri zeropain Fri Ruffmuff Fuck these idiots playing with their phones What happened to the good ole days when we played with each other or played with ourself No app to replace a good bang session Fri Son of Loki Fri Theonewhoknows Politics economics and media they all in the gutter We have to ask ourselves a question what we can do about it HERE AND NOW We all know that the ship is going down but the music keeps playing but what we should be thinking about is how not to be swept by the wave of bad consequences developed world indebtedness bubbles in many corners of market and war on cash Playing a bear against central banks may be very hard on the other hand prolonging this binge QEdriven bubbles equals meeting a wall sooner or later httpindependenttraderorgistimetoshortalreadyherehtml Fri skinwalker The wife bought an SE She used her own money so I cant yell at her Ill stick with my flip phone myself Fri KnuckleDraggerX Fri williambanzai This of course happens every time they get ready to launch a new flagship model like the which is supposedly coming this year Fri zeropain Fri TradingIsLifeBrah Do you see people not using Smartphones anymore I see them all the time What is this new technology that you think has replaced smartphones GoPro or is it your FitBit watch that allows people to no longer need a smartphone If people own a smartphone then they eventually upgrade it the phone become very sluggish after or so years so eventually even the cheapest of people upgrade their phones Apple manages to keep people within its ecosystem and has a ton of people in it so whenever those people upgrade they end up most of the time buying a new iPhone The fascination with Smartphones peaked a few years ago which is why all the Android manufacturers are going belly up Now its a commodity type need versus a want and Apple gives people what they need Fri skinwalker I have discovered a great new technology that blows smart phones out of the water Its called a flip phone The battery lasts more than an hour you can actually make calls with it and you dont have people bugging you every femtosecond with some irrelevant text or email or other garbage Fri TradingIsLifeBrah Im always amazed when people are surprised that a new iPhone will be released those people being the News Media Every year at the same time in September Apple releases a new phone yet within months of release the news forgets that it happens and is surprised that Apple is adjusting its supply chain to slow down builds on its old phones so that they can prepare for the new phone Apples Days in Inventory for was days which is insane for a Hardware focused company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which is a lot less hardware focused has Days in Inventory Why is anyone surprised that Apple would be managing down its inventory when its practically a master in Inventory Management Fri jus_lite_reading Ive been talking to like everybody and they all agree iPhone SE iPhone C Another epic fail NOBODY is going to buy the SE model Not even illegal immigrants want that lowly model LMAO Fri TradingIsLifeBrah Yawn of course sales slow down now There is another iPhone to be released in the Fall Most people get the new phone not the old one if they want to upgrade The bigger surprise in a slowdown would have occurred in the December period end March and June will always be a slowdown as Apple shifts production to the build of its new iPhone In other news Apple is mining Gold now Apples recycling program is doing very well As part of its annual environmental report that the company released yesterday Apple declared that it had recovered nearly million pounds of materials from Apple devices recycled through is program in Sixtyone million pounds of those materials are reusable in future products including pounds of gold which Business Insider calculates is worth nearly million Apparently that iPhone disassembling robot was a good investment Fri EF Mutton Are you trying to say that no one wants a repackaged S at twice the price Or a watch that does the same damn thing on a smaller screen Fri PPT Inc Fri EF Mutton Yes Tims iPlug idea didnt go over well outside of San Francisco focus groups Fortunately the rectal fires amongst betatesters were rare and quickly hushed Seriously STOP If theres no news dont try and make mountains out of mole hills Fri Temporalist Fri smc it might be something to do with trying to sell a phone for with GB of storage thats what stopped me upgrading for the last two years each year they make the same mistake and I put it off for another year until they upgrade the momory on the base model My year old phone has GB of storage Fri Grandad Grumps Funny how the news comes out AFTER it has already taken place Notice the Jan Mar comment The adjustment appears to have been completed Fri Hohum Fri adr Ive had the same phone for years An old Sony Flagship before the Experia Z I paid for it at ATT and then took it over to a non contract cell phone plan that costs me a month for unlimited everything The phone still lasts all day on a charge and can run everything it needs to At some point the power of a new phone isnt needed unless the bloat of the OS ruins the performance Kind of like every windows version past XP My phone was better than the iPhone until the iPhone The screen resolution processor and camera were better than any previous iPhone I also laugh at the people with cracked screens when my phone can survive any normal drop Apple has been and always will be garbage with a premium price tag The Chinese have woken up to that fact now the rest of the world needs to For the record I think weve had peak iPhone and margins are going to start coming under pressure in the next to months and Im interested in news that verifies or disproves that belief but cmon ZH enough with the HYSTERICS Fri Peacefulwarrior Tim Cook Apple Innovation is less than Steve Jobs Innovation flailing demand more stock buybacks margin compression desperate use of their
