style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in an allcash deal for per share We believe the likelihood of the deal closing is high and is expected to close this calendar year This article discusses the potential mergerarbitrage opportunity in LinkedIn NYSE LNKD after its agreement to be bought out by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT The deal essentially brings together the worlds leading cloud and professional networks under one house The number of synergies is exciting when you think about it Individuals are usually working or using one of these two worlds by using Office or Dynamics for CRM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and using their professional network to grow relationships LinkedIn This deal brings these two worlds together Is LinkedIn a merger arbitrage candidate Even with Microsofts less than stellar acquisition history well see if there is opportunity as a MergerArbitrage Candidate Lets dive in and find out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has more than enough cash on its balance sheet billion and plenty of access to capital given its stellar balance sheet Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could theoretically buy LinkedIn times over the company will fund the new acquisition from new debt because the tech giant would open itself up to a massive tax bill by repatriating cash from overseas With this being said we do not see a high probability of failure given Microsofts strong capital position the lack of regulatory interference and the allcash deal that is easily covered by Microsofts excess cash and ability to borrow the billion The deal is said to close by the end of the year months both sides appear to be excited about the deal and the synergies involved and there seem to be no regulatory hurdles This should help pave the way for a smooth transaction LinkedIn is currently priced at x FCF which gives an implied yield of It seems to be overvalued at current cash levels but the synergies involved make it difficult to calculate a real ROI Also we doubt there will be any additional suitors for the company as it would set off a bidding war There are few if any companies that would be able to compete in a bidding war with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>And lets now forget there are many uncertainties around potential mergers such as antitrust approvals multiple government reviews changes in market conditions shareholder approval and due diligence If the deal was not completed we would expect prices to drop to the predeal price of or a loss of We give the deal a chance of being complete based on the parties and terms of the buyout offer which we stated above At the recent quote the stock is trading at per share below the announced cash offer of per share by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>We calculate our expected return with the probability of a favorable deal x And we subtract that from our expected loss with the likelihood of that loss occurring x This is the expected weighted return which gives us a potential return of or per share To calculate our annualized Expected return we divide that by the expected time of holding in years months This gives us an annualized expected return of Cofounder Reid Hoffman called the deal a refounding moment for LinkedIn As a merger of two great companies it looks incredibly attractive As a merger arbitrage deal we do not see a high probability of failure given Microsofts strong capital position and the lack of regulatory interference However from a merger arbitrage opportunity this appears to be unappealing at current levels with a potential annualized return profile The risk does not justify the return in this case If you were inclined to participate in the potential for a higher bid which we dont expect wed typically look to purchase outofthemoney call options as cheap and far out as possible In this case wed look at the November Calls for The deal looks like it will be finalized without a hitch but we dont see a high probably for an increased bid due to valuation and other bidders not wanting to bid with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>WARNING Mergerarb can be tempting for investors to use leverage to increase their annualized return on high probability events Resist the urge Many Wall Street firms conduct mergerarb as their main business and they will normally have or more mergerarbitrage investments at any one time They understand that if a couple of deals go badly the winners will more than take care of the losers Mergerarb can be a very crowded strategy at times Similar to value investing it can be cyclical and go in and out of favor over time The key to mergerarb is to focus on the few deals that are highly probable ideally ALL cash deals with minimal regulatory hurdles and an acquirer with a great capital base And if youre new to mergerarb watch a few deals playout over various industries to get an understanding of the deals If you do invest in mergerarb situations conduct proper due diligence and make sure to spread your risk appropriately If you are so inclined to learn more about these types of special situation I highly recommend Grahams writing on arbitrage in his Security Analysis book Frank Sands
