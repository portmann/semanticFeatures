class='textDiv'>Stocks Dive What Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Thinking Bezeks Daily Briefing Seeking Alpha Stocks continued to sell off on Monday Volatility surged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>buys LinkedIn Im not impressed As seems to always be the case the market has started to tank while your author is traveling Regardless heres my quick take on Mondays dramatic selling Monday saw big losses for global equity markets The US indices were all down close to a percent and this was far from the worst showing globally In fact most countries saw heavier selling than the US markets This was very much reflected in some classic riskoff trades Volatility was one big mover After going dormant since February the VIX index sprang back to life up on the day to put in its first close over in more than three months The volatility ETFs VXX UVXY SVXY and so on made huge moves VXX was up good for its thlargest one day percentage increase ever Normally VXX moves with about a fourtoone ratio to the SP NYSEARCA SPY As such youd generally expect a roughly gain on the day Instead it rose close to Make no mistake this is a market that was heavily short volatility and got caught badly off balance now that new highs have been decisively rejected On a similarsized drop in stocks on Friday the VXX was up less than What happens next This sort of mounting fear while stocks slide steadily often leads to a big washout sort of day Id be cautious buying the dip just yet the move in volatility implies something big may be coming While its tempting to say people are overly worked up about the possibility of Brexit the selling isnt just about that There have been plenty of pentup reasons to sell stocks Among them are renewed weakness in China poor earnings rising recession odds and troubling action in the credit markets While Brexit may be the straw that broke the camels back there were plenty of reasons to think the odds of a correction were mounting as the SP struggled to top Speaking of bonds NYSEARCA TLT they continue to soar to rarelyseenbefore levels And yields continue to slump to record lows abroad in places including the UK Switzerland and Germany The credit markets are preparing for some sort of deep global economic freeze I was left puzzled when stocks surged following the poor jobs data recently Yes its a bit of a plus that the Fed isnt going to hike but what it implies that the economy is too weak to support even a modest rate hike is far from a good thing Without a rapid turn in sentiment we will have now entered a correction I see little reason to buy stocks before the SP tests at least Bulls had plenty of chances to push through to new record highs and they failed Now sellers are in charge and Im in no rush to buck the trend While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has seen improved fortunes in recent years its reputation for a lack of vision as to the future of technology remains firmly ingrained To that end its latest deal an allcash buyout of LinkedIn NYSE LNKD is straight out of the companys wellworn playbook Like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>heading into the MP player market well after Apple had conquered it with the neardead on arrival Zune the deal for LinkedIn strikes one as being tardy and illplanned For starters theres few clear synergies between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and LinkedIn What are they going to do make us upgrade to Windows in order to keep logging onto the site Better mobile integration between LinkedIn and the vanishingly small number of Windows phone users The deal is dilutive to earnings and far too expensive Is LinkedIn really such a hot property that you want to pay almost x EBITDA for it Generally as a investing strategy paying billion in cash for a property yielding million of annual free cash flow would be judged as a poor deal While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>remains a cash cow Windows has held up much better than most people were expecting theres still little investment rationale for the company if it wastes the money on noncore overpriced acquisitions If youre long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>you want the company using that stream of free cash flow to pay dividends or buy back stock If it can find profitable ways to internally reinvest money thats good too But buying a fading social media hasbeen property after the buzz is long gone It adds neither immediately accretive profits or much real potential for such in the future Not only is there no steak you hardly even get any sizzle The only real winners here are LinkedIn stockholders If you held through the quarterly earnings report back in February where the stock got hit for about of its value overnight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has offered you a graceful chance to exit without a loss Beyond that this deal seems like a loser for just about everyone If youre a LinkedIn employee its probably time to update your resume given Microsofts ownership of web properties generally ends poorly As for other social media names there may be some me too trades into companies like Twitter NYSE TWTR or Yelp NYSE YELP Id be wary of chasing the buzz though I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>overpaying for one sector player will spark much of a broader MA rush Finally famed short seller Citron Research was out with a call to short Facebook NASDAQ FB on Monday Citron didnt disclose the reasoning for this citing media distraction in the wake of the tragic shooting over the weekend as a reason to stay mum for the time being Regardless I cant imagine what the thesis will be other than overvaluation which everyone is already aware of To be frank I see little exciting on either the long or short side of social media By the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>starts picking over the remaining MA targets the herd would long have moved to greener pastures Disclosure I amwe are short SVXY UVXY I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship
