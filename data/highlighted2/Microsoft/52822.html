online food ordering service would explode if introduced to social networking platforms Imagine the following scenario foodies share pictures of delicious meals they ordered on Instagram and when their friends click on the photos they have the option to place their own order for delivery for the food The whole scene would be made possible by integrating the GrubHub NYSE GRUB dining system with the Facebook NASDAQ FB platform If that happens all Facebook users on Instagram WhatsApp and Messenger would find much more comfortable living in the Facebook ecosystem with the valueadded service enabled by GrubHub Yes the viewpoint of this article is GrubHub is a good acquisition target for Facebook In the past two years Facebook has made clear its determination to exert impact on everyones social life through acquisitions of popular apps like Instagram and then WhatsApp GrubHub could be the next one added to that list given the potential huge business and userexperienceenhancing opportunities GrubHub could bring to Facebook GrubHub has grown its user base around yearoveryear almost in the same speed at which Instagram and WhatsApp manage to attract new users Currently valued at a little more than three times of the money Facebook paid to buy Instagram in and less than onefifth of what Facebook paid for WhatsApp in See Exhibit GrubHub has already maturated its moneyspinning model and is churning out impressive amount of revenue and profits each day by taking commission on every dining order users make through its websitemobile app This model stands in contrast with how Facebook has delayed heavy monetization through advertising in Instagram and WhatsApp in fear of the side effects of harming user experience GrubHub offers one natural solution for Facebook to exploit its large user base without bombarding them with advertisements which takes the risk of displeasing or even turning away current users The online food ordering industry compared to the internet advertising industry which Facebook sources most of its revenue from is still in its nascent stage The current food takeout market in US is estimated to be around Billion a year in sales while the global internet advertising market is at Billion as estimated by ZenithOptimedia see Exhibit As the market leader in online food ordering GrubHub has the highest market share but only generates less than half a billion in revenue a year Any significant sales transfer from offline takeout ordering to online ordering could give a huge boost to the online food ordering industry considering a commission rate of GrubHub currently charges per order The online food ordering industry is much less saturated than the internet advertising industry where dominant players like Google Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have to compete with each other to grab market share GrubHub sees strong growth ahead and is now valued at a reasonable market capitalization level If we compare financial outcomes between GrubHub and Facebook see Exhibit GrubHub generated revenue and net income around and of that of Facebooks respectively while its market cap is only that of Facebooks These valuations stand all the while GrubHub expands its user base and grows revenueincome at a much faster pace than Facebook does on its business One noteworthy aspect of GrubHub is that its small user base is capable of generating the current level of revenue Say if Facebook integrates GrubHub as an embedded function to its system the usage of this dining feature by of current Facebook active users could easily increase the number of daily grubs by four times and assuming revenue rises proportionally this dining feature could bring in more than of Facebooks current revenue Facebook would benefit from acquiring GrubHub and integrating the online food ordering service to its platform in the following three ways Providing an online food ordering service on their platforms would enhance user experience and help Facebook monetize its large user base Adding real life functions like food ordering service in social networking platforms strengthens the user stickiness to the online virtual ecosystem The need for Facebook to diversify its revenue sources Currently Ads accounts for more than of Facebooks revenue Addition of GrubHub has the potential to open a big undertapped market for Facebook and the integration process should proceed very naturally without disruptive effects on Facebooks social networking platforms Facebook would not need to worry about scalability issues The infrastructure GrubHub is investing heavily in would prepare it well to meet expected huge service demand from Facebook users GrubHub unique among its competitors has the capacity to serve a demand spike thanks to its aggressive infrastructure investment All in all Facebook acquiring GrubHub is a winwin game Providing online food ordering service would fit the current Facebook ecosystem well GrubHub has the most advanced infrastructure and a wellrun management team in the fledgling market to whet appetites of both Facebook and GrubHub investors and most
