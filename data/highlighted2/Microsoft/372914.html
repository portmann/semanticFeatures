opportunity ahead of it in cloud infrastructure services So why look at adding downside protection to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now One reason to consider it is concern about the broader stock market as exemplified by recent warning notes by Goldman Sachs NYSE GS and Evercore ISI On Thursday Seeking Alpha CEO and news editor Eli Hoffman excerpted both notes Goldmans note The recent relief rally may be shortlived cautioned that the markets recovery rally had been too fast and the engine they saw driving it the oil market recovery might be about to stall Evercore ISIs warning was more bearish Sell stocks and buy gold as the firm abandoned its upside target on the SP in light of reversals in technical indicators If you share Evercores view you may have already sold your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares and bought gold in which case you might want to read about Hedging Your Bets On Gold If on the other hand youre still generally bullish about the market and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but want to limit your downside risk in the event youre wrong hedging might make sense for you So well look at a couple of different ways of hedging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>below If youd like a refresher on hedging terms first please see the section titled Refresher On Hedging Terms in our article on hedging Realty Income NYSE O Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge MSFT below but you dont need the app for this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the math Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app one additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for an optimal put is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of Often wed write that if you are more riskaverse you could use a smaller threshold but in this case it was too expensive to hedge MSFT against a smaller threshold over the next several months with optimal puts But if you are less riskaverse you could have used a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Thursdays close to hedge shares of MSFT against a greater than drop by late October As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A couple of points about this cost To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the puts In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes the hedging cost so that in the worstcase scenario your MSFT position would be down not including the hedging cost When scanning for an optimal collar youll need one more figure in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a severalmonth period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap You dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>passed our two screens to avoid bad investments we were able to get a potential return estimate for it from the Portfolio Armor website The sites potential return for it was so well use that as the cap on our collar below As of Thursdays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of MSFT against a greater than drop by late October while not capping an investors upside at less than You might have noticed that the strike price of the put leg of this collar is different from the strike of the optimal put above despite both hedges having the same threshold Thats enabled by the net hedging cost of this optimal collar being significantly lower than the cost of the optimal put hedge As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or as a percentage of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was or of position value One note on this collar hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal put to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have paid less than when opening this collar Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article
