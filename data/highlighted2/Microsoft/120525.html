The rest of the movie pipeline will only lead to greater returns for the company helping to reduce dependence on their ESPN stream Theme park expansion globally improving margins and a strong historical precedence only provides more push in the stock towards the range by the end of We all dont need another article telling us why to be long in Disney NYSE DIS We understand the brand the multiple billiondollar revenue streams and strong dividend are enough to make this stock a portfolio staple What we need is a reason to double down and buy more shares of Disney This stock is currently undervalued heading into based upon its movie pipeline and stake in ESPN among several other factors The YTD increase of is about to skyrocket before the calendar year is out With the change in the stock being preceded by a decade of SPcrushing returns I believe were only going to see higher returns for each of the next three years Studio entertainment only accounts for of the companys overall revenues but I have every indication to believe that is going to change dramatically over the next three years based upon blockbuster potential Double down in Disney because you as an investor know that while their acquisition of the Star Wars franchise was highly controversial the move is going to be the best return generator the company has seen in quite some time With projections for the movie to reach up to billion at the box office which will only represent the accumulation in the infancy of the films full life cycle Disney is sitting pretty with this new revenue component This franchise alone can bring billions more in revenue for merchandise and video games But why stop there Their lineup for movies in the next three years is packed full of billiondollar potential films all familiar and loved by the public Frozen The followup to the billion hit at the boxoffice Cars The third installment in a series that has collectively earned billion at the box office Two more Star Wars films with unlimited potential Over the next three years listed above are separate growth catalysts for the stock to see higher levels While levels are highly dependent upon street expectations and they will be high expectations I fully believe Disney will outperform With Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm all studios under Disneys control the profit potential has an exceptional amount of room to run If the pipeline isnt enough for you take a look at global expansion in theme parks A Shanghai location will launch next spring Disneyland in Anaheim California is expected to create jobs and DisneyWorld in Florida Its worth noting that the companys expansion into China is no small feat Focusing on the middle class who has a rising digital footprint will aid in boosting revenues in the longterm With the recent volatility associated with Chinese markets and abnormal spreads for everything from commodities to financial products Disney needs to be incredibly tactful in how they scale out their operations That being said a move into Shanghai seems like an increasingly fruitful move Id suggest reading another contributors article to gain the specifics on the move The profitability estimates contained within this article are on the high end in my opinion but nonetheless certainly possible for Disney for the FY The stock will see much more growth if the consumer product segment can improve Representing about of total revenue the segment should see much more efficacy given the movie pipeline Playmation is the most notable addition and I see it bringing in about t million in additional revenue for the company which is definitely a more than safe estimate Exploiting Star Wars to its fullest extent will be vital to this segments growth Id like to know where the short interest folks are on this stock especially in consideration of the companys great dividend At a yield the dividend could certainly be higher especially considering the increased profitability over the past decade and the spotty payouts but it is nonetheless there as a kickback and expected to improve in the coming semis The company has also enjoyed a steadily high growth rate for the dividend over the past decade I readily expect Disney to hit by the end of the year and with a PE of I believe this is more than possible given that there are next to no signs that Disney will falter on its current uptrend One recent negative piece on Disney did catch my eye but I actually believe the weakenesses recognized in Disney are actually strengths for the company moving forward The author noted that ESPN accounts for of Disneys profits The focus here rather should be that the company owns of ESPN which has experienced its own tremendous success over the past year With higher subscription rates and an increasing amount of viewers based upon soccer and fantasy sports gaining a stronger foothold in the United States this is a lucrative stake Theres an obvious concern that Disney may rely too heavily on ESPN but I believe the composition of Disneys profits will change with the movie pipeline and global expansion in the coming years Disney has always bred one type of product in my mind a quality one Im late to the games in terms of an entry point as this stock is much like Apple or Google or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>where I shouldve bought years ago
