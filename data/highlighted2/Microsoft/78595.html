Apple may preview a version of iOS that runs multiple apps simultaneously possibly in a split screen The compelling motivation for this is the impending onslaught of Windows devices A little over a year ago rumors sprang up of a splitscreen multitasking feature that was in the works for Apples NASDAQ AAPL iOS The feature would allow two apps to run side by side as Windows does now on tablets The rumors came to naught but could this be a part of iOS I believe that forces are converging that make this likely The rumors kicked off last year in May with a report by Mark Gurman in tomac that iOS would feature splitscreen multitasking for iPad Further fuel was added to the rumor fire when developer Steven TroughtonSmith produced a video claiming to demonstrate hidden code in iOS that supported app resizing as a precursor to splitscreen multitasking To this day iOS doesnt support splitscreen multitasking and users can only experience apps one at a time except for notifications In a recent article from May Mark Gurman again repeated his prediction of splitscreen multitasking in conjunction with the much rumored inch iPad Pro Why is splitscreen multitasking important The ability to view and interact with multiple apps simultaneously is something we all take for granted for desktop and laptop devices running Windows or Mac OS X In Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT implemented a tablet analog to multiple open windows through the split screen Since Windows represented a convergence of tablet and desktop user interfaces it was natural for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to offer some form of app multitasking for Windows tablets As of Microsofts latest Build developer conference in April the ability to run multiple simultaneous apps will become even more useful in the soontobereleased Windows Through what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>calls Continuum tablet users will be able to view multiple apps either in splitscreen mode or through touch or pen resizable windows With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>focusing its efforts on Intel processors for all Windows devices the multiapp experience on Windows Continuum will work very well Without something equivalent for iOS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will have a significant competitive advantage through its multitasking support in Windows The lack of splitscreen capability in iOS has led many to conclude that iOS is not a true multitasking operating system Nothing could be further from the truth iOS like Mac OS X is a true multitasking OS based on UNIX iOS like its Mac OS big brother continuously runs multiple tasks or processes in the background These processes can include other apps than the one the user might currently be engaged with What an app is allowed to do in the background is very limited however Thus this articles title refers to the fact that apps are kept on a very tight leash The limitations that Apple imposes on background operation of apps have mostly to do with hardware the limited RAM screen size processor capability and battery power of the device Its not the OS With the introduction of Apples iOS devices last fall those hardware limitations began to be relaxed iPhone introduced much larger screen sizes The Apple Ax processor in the iPad Air featured processor cores as well as very enhanced graphics capability With the A Apple would probably have had sufficient processor capability to implement splitscreen multitasking if it hadnt been for Continuity not to be confused with Microsofts Continuum In retrospect Continuity may have been partly to blame for many of the problems iOS and Mac OS X users encountered since the release of the latest versions of the operating systems last fall Continuity provides for proximitybased transfer of ongoing tasks such as document editing Continuity is supposed to allow for seamless transfer of the users app focus from device to device Continuity requires that iOS devices be situationally aware to a greater extent than ever before This usually means monitoring Bluetooth and WiFi for a potential hand off of an application focus from a nearby device Since the latest release of Mac OS and iOS numerous users have complained about poor WiFi performance and battery life Continuitys impact may only have been indirect but everyone has noticed the problems this year with the latest Apple operating systems Recently it was reported that the latest OS X beta contains a reversion of the system to prior code The OS component that was yanked out of the beta called discoveryd appears to have been put in as part of the OS overhaul to support Continuity With all the fires that Apple has been racing to put out in the current gen operating systems its not really surprising that splitscreen multitasking in iOS fell by the wayside And given that at least some of the problems have yet to be fully resolved its no wonder that many articles on WWDC have asserted that this years versions of Apples operating systems would focus on incremental improvements and bug fixes The conventional wisdom has it that just as Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL IO developer conference focused on bug fixes in the next generation Android Apple must do the same for iOS There are certainly many in the developer community who might wish for Apple to slow down and do what the pundits suggest Thats not likely however Even as the threat of Android seems to have abated somewhat a new much more potent threat has emerged in the form of Windows Microsofts Build developer conference gave every indication that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is going to get Windows right this time One of the ways that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is getting it right is by going to an all Intel NASDAQ INTC architecture approach something Ive long advocated Often when I write about Intel I get accused of being antiIntel Im not At this very moment Im writing this article on an Intelbased computer For desktop applications Intel has no peer as yet What I have said is that Intel is cost disadvantaged relative to ARM processors of equivalent capability So why have I advocated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>abandon its ARM devices Because the most important factor for Microsofts success is retaining its current Windows user base And that means compatibility with Intel Microsofts Windows users will pay the Intel premium to maintain that compatibility The ongoing decline in iPad sales year over year demonstrates that Windows on Intel tablets is gaining traction Windows is going to get even more traction Windows phone has been only treading water since the Nokia acquisition but Windows on Intel phones will probably start to increase market share for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Ive dwelt at some length on the implications of Windows by way of setting the stage for Apples response The threat of Windows is by far the most compelling reason that Apple has to implement some form of app multitasking in iOS If for some inscrutable reason Apple fails to implement app multitasking it will have to endure even further iPad sales declines But there are other motivations that make split screen or a similar feature almost inevitable for iOS The most important enabler will be the next generation Apple A custom system on chip SOC This will be fabricated initially by Samsung OTCSSNLF on its nm process As such it will be much more powerful while having longer battery life If the performance of the A was marginal to support split screen the A wont be In addition to the new processor theres the advent of the iPad Pro expected later this year This is a device supposedly targeting professionals and may even be equipped with a pen Its hard to imagine this market responding enthusiastically to the iPad Pro with only iOS x to power it iOS enabled with some form of app multitasking will be critical for the success of the iPad and this is probably the reason why we wont see the Pro until the Fall In order for developers to modify their apps to support the app multitasking approach that Apple implements Apple will have to provide that capability in the iOS beta that will be made available at the conference This will afford developers this necessary time to get ready for the roll out of the new OS and related devices in the Fall We might also see a sneak preview of the iPad Pro Once again this is for the benefit of developers so that they know what changes to make to support the Pro and iOS Even if the Pro doesnt go on sale right away Apple would need to provide developers with a Pro simulator at which point the cat is out of the bag Fellow SA contributor Bill Maurer has pointed out that WWDC has historically not been particularly good for Apples share price I believe that if Apple unveils app multitasking and especially if it shows the iPad Pro this will have a galvanizing effect on the stock And Apples stock price may once again approach reasonable Source Will Apple Unleash iOS Multitasking At WWDC Disclosure The author is long AAPL MoreThe author wrote this article
