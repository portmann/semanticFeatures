class='textDiv'>IBM Declares Maneuver Warfare Against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>International Business Machines Corporation NYSEIBM Seeking Alpha IBM will build a suite of cloudbased tools and applications jointly with Cisco for social collaboration Can Microsofts plan to acquire LinkedIn challenge IBMs competitive edge in social business In the past such acquisitions didnt work for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>IBM NYSE IBM and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO have announced that they will develop a suite of cloudbased tools and applications for greater collaboration in the workplace Embracing IBMs cognitive computing platform IBM Watson the applications will help enterprises grow their revenue from social presence As a result IBMs revenue from Watson will rise significantly Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT plan to acquire LinkedIn NYSE LNKD is aimed at growing the formers social business The big question is can IBM and Cisco together displace Microsofts social business I believe IBM Watson will make all the difference in favor of IBMCisco IBM Watson has the potential to provide IBMCisco a competitive advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Workplace collaboration is gradually rising with UC unified communications fast gaining momentum UC is a set of communication tools including email instant messaging web conferencing and so forth which facilitates performing business by exploiting the advantages of cloudbased collaboration platforms such as IBMs Connections or Microsofts Yammer Rising adoption of UC will lead to greater collaboration and in turn greater innovation According to a report It has been predicted that by when the ideas economy is fully matured a culture of collaboration and innovation in the workplace will be what motivates people and stimulates business growth IBM and Cisco have already built compelling social platforms for collaboration Now they have announced that they will partner to combine the marketleading strengths of each company to transform how knowledgeworkers collaborate and work IBMs analytics technology coupled with IBM Watson will allow businesses to take the advantages of cognitive computing which can be integrated into the collaborative platforms As a result social communications will become more productive for driving business growth Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is planning to strengthen its UC platform via acquiring professional networking site LinkedIn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>acquired collaboration platform Yammer four years ago but failed to properly integrate it with its existing UC platform SharePoint The company has therefore made Yammer a core component of Office Given Microsofts current hodgepodge social business strategy it will be difficult for the company to outcompete IBM and Cisco via acquiring LinkedIn IBMs collaboration platform Connections offers a social network for enterprises that lets them gather generate and improve ideas via a variety of communication tools Cisco on the other hand has developed its online collaboration platform Spark and online meetings platform WebEx The two companies have agreed to build a broad ecosystem comprising of developers and partners which will let them build their own collaborative solutions Further integrating IBM Watson with their solutions developers will be able to incorporate BI business intelligence therein On the contrary Microsofts social strategy is somewhat uncoordinated What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has done so far Well it has created a platform to consolidate data that it receives as customer feedback from various channels such as surveys UserVoice forums and Yammer groups In the next step <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>passes the data to Azure machine learning APIs to analyze the data using Azures analytics solutions Finally for easy visualization of the data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>pushes the data to Power BI using Power BI APIs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is currently using the abovementioned platform for its own internal research on how to offer customers compelling analytics tools to extract actionable insights from various social channels The company is planning to extend the benefits of the platform with customizable features to customers as well starting next year In addition to performing research <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has introduced a new reporting dashboard in its Office admin center earlier this year which shows usage reports for SharePoint OneDrive Yammer and Skype However unless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>comes up with a customizable ecosystemdriven platform the reporting dashboard will be nothing more than a clumsy solution for a complex problem I believe Power BI is a strong tool that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will eventually exploit to compete with IBMCisco Granted the IBMCisco duo hasnt built their ecosystem yet and in this context <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt far behind But IBM has made some visible progress in social business by developing Connections which I believe is more powerful as a social platform compared to Microsofts Yammer to learn more watch this video To put it into perspective lets focus on how the platform helps enterprises extract insights from unstructured text obtained from emails Since we are heading toward the ideas economy as mentioned above we need insights from communications Among the communication tools of Connections I believe the Verse email tool is most useful since it offers integrated social analytics software Analytics helps users prioritize email content according to relevance Analytics can also be used for content delivered via email in order to accomplish predefined business goals such a growing revenues or lowering costs Microsofts Azure also offers machine learning APIs based on NLP natural language processing for extracting insights from unstructured text However since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt have a compelling social platform like Connections enterprises have limited scope to use the APIs in a social environment For other forms of communications apart from emails such as instant messaging or web conferencing developers can write apps in future for extracting actionable insights using the ecosystem the IBMCisco duo is going to build In contrast building an ecosystem for social business per se isnt something which we can expect from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the nearterm It has to spend a lot of time to properly integrate LinkedIn to its existing UC platform In maneuver warfare the goal is incapacitating the enemys decisionmaking process via shock and disruption I believe the term is appropriate in the current context because IBMs cognitive computing platform is really disruptive Why Well I wrote two articles earlier to explain this Click here and here if you want to read In addition its collaboration with Cisco has the potential to provide shock to Microsofts social business endeavor via acquiring LinkedIn For businesses new ideas dont always come from employees but from analyticsdriven insights from external content as well As a result IBMs Connections could emerge as an essential tool for collaborationdriven innovation For IBM this is a huge opportunity to grow its cognitive computing revenue ie revenue from IBM Watson IBM is silently making steady progress in social business which has tremendous growth potential The stock is a buy for the longterm I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology
