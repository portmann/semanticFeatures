NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha MSFT has released a fresh round of content packs for Power BI I continue to applaud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for its tailored approach to winning customers via Power BI <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has again added a round of content packs to its Power BI platform This time the content packs for Power BI include packs for widely deployed Adobe Analytics NASDAQ ADBE inhouse tech Azure Mobile Engagement and SMBfocused Webtrends Power BI which is already my BI platform of choice gets even more comprehensive with these tailormade additions That said the increased content pack capacity also speaks well to the broader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Power BI strategic initiative of avoiding off the rack BI additives whenever possible a luxury that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can afford to indulge in being of the size that it is While this hasnt been stated as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Power BI strategy per se its one thats easy enough to extrapolate via the companys focus on frequent content pack updating and delivery What does Power BI get for its content pack efforts I think it gets quite a bit But first lets breakout what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is deploying in each content pack Adobe Analytics Adobe Analytics which has a huge following across SMBs and enterprise seats both areas of focus for Power BI with a particular bonus focus on SMB aggregation is part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud Adobe Analytics core purpose is analysis of customer data With integration via a content pack to Power BI BIAdobe Analytics users can analyze where visitors are coming from what days they come the most frequently and how long theyre staying as well as several metrics based on ecommerce data CRM attributes and engagement Power BI offers Adobe Analytics users a tailored sevenpage report based on the most recent data load which is displayed at a central user Dashboard From there Adobe Analytics users can drill down into the data set report data repin to customize the Dashboard or rerun the data set Azure Mobile Engagement Azure Mobile Engagement is an app analytics service that allows developers yet another key <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>seat target track their applications performance which can lead to increased retention and app usage Of course increased app usage drives key metrics you can imagine why nailing down a content pack for Azure Mobile Engagement which is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>tech anyways is important Once credentialed credentials are provided from within Azure Mobile Engagement a Dashboard is created for users on an automatic basis The Dashboard is a set of tiles with each displaying a specific metric to monitor from the Dashboard view Selecting a tile drills in further into a report Examples of reports than can again be pinned to the Dashboard in total open architecture are Monthly Crash and Bug Report Weekly Crash and Bug Report Other Technical Data Monthly Other Technical Data Weekly Monthly User Report Monthly User Activity Weekly User Activity and Map etc Webtrends Webtrends is an analytics engine for digital marketing that is widely used by advertisers marketers webpage managers etc I hate to be repetitive but these are all key seats that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is focused on introducing itself to Webtrends users have the ability to observe analyze and deliver insights on the visitor process across web social mobile and SharePoint channels With the release of the Webtrends content pack users will now have the ability to use Power BI to monitor analyze and visualize their Webtrends analytics data While having less total capacity and open architecture than the Adobe Analytics content pack only six pages of reporting where Adobe Analytics has seven this is still quite a bit of BI tech being deployed Now that weve described the content packs individually what does this mean for Power BI and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Again I think the big takeaway is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is targeting user acquisition the right way Whats the right way I think its by doing whats best for the customer instead of maybe doing whats best for the company at least in the immediate term Could <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had just as easily not deployed these specialized content packs and asked users via more traditional marketing efforts to use its BI for the above now tailored use cases Sure It very well could have But by taking the time effort and costs to actually build customized content packs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is telling the users that it wants to be the partner of choice for the tech being deployed and that its willing to invest in the relationship That matters In a tech economy thats moving further and further away from being one thats transactional and one thats for lack of a better phrase fully comprehensive this is pointing to the fact that many tech customers are now using the best of breed point solutions as an aggregated best of breed solution being willing to win a relationship rather than a right now usecase matters It matters because as the tech economy shifts more into a lifetime customer value focus the relationship is the underlying retention creator I think its fairly obvious that gone are the days of superaggregating all inhouse solutions Now a user can use Wordpress for his or her webpage Zendesk NYSE ZEN for customer service Salesforcecom NYSE CRM for CRM HubSpot NYSE HUBS for marketing and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Power BI for BI and analytics And guess what Thats just fine to every company in the hypothetical list as long as the company in the list has a happy customer that it can get recurring revenue from and a max LTV Believe me this describes the new tech economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is just further acknowledging this with Power BI content packs and the content pack focus With these content packs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has basically sent a nonthreatening letter of sorts to users of the broader platforms for integration ex the inhouse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>tech obviously The letter says I know you love your platform for insert use case and thats fine I know I cant compete But maybe I can make this platform a little more useful Consider us for addressing a need you dont already have a solution for Heres to hoping Microsofts sense of awareness and sense of reality pays off for it Disclosure I
