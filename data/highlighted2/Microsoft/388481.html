dive If you still believe in the company this can provide you with an attractive entry point Three companies that my wife and I have in our portfolio and would like to add to got clobbered after reporting earnings this week Visa NYSE V dropped Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX lost and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT got hammered to the tune of the day after their quarterly earnings reports came out All three companies are flat or down since the beginning of the year If you were an investor that only cared about capital gains you probably would not be too happy with the price action of these stocks If you are a dividend growth investor however your emotions might be the exact opposite All three of these companies are dominant in their sectors of the economy All three have shown that they are willing to pay and raise dividends to shareholders And all three have had impressive gains in share price over the last year If you are a dividend growth investor the following table might interest you Each company has had impressive dividend growth over the past five years While Starbucks and Visa are relatively new to the dividend game they both have average dividend growth over the past five years Even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which has been paying a dividend for most of the past century has attractive dividend growth of close to over the previous five years In the table I also included each companys return for the previous year Even with yesterdays drop each company has an impressive gain in share price over the last twelve months This doesnt even account for dividends received Since all of these companies have had a run up in price you may have thought that they were too expensive to add to Each of these companies suffered losses because their most recent quarters werent as good as expected In other words they were priced for perfection If you are a longterm investor like us the sharp drop in share price might be a buying opportunity While quarterly reports give you an insight into a companys current financial decision they can often cause investors to overreact either positively or negatively to the current news Using that overreaction to your benefit can help you acquire shares at attractive prices I use a shopping list to identify what target price I have for each company that I follow That way when the market knocks them down I can attempt to remove emotion from my investments and buy more shares at the prices I want Lets take a look at my target prices for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Starbucks and Visa For a recap of our investment guidelines click here As previously stated the technology giant has had a nice share price appreciation Ive purchased two lots of shares at an average price of and have been looking for the stock to trade lower so I could add to the position Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ended the week at FAST Graphs has a fiveyear average PE ratio of and the current PE ratio is That is a steep premium SP Capital has a twelvemonth price target of and a current fair value of which is a and discount respectively Morningstar is much more bullish as they see fair value at almost higher from Fridays close Averaging the metrics together I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as undervalued With years of dividend growth I would be willing to pay a premium for shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be considered a buy One reason I might hesitate to pull the trigger at these prices is that the current PE is really out of whack compared to the fiveyear average If you use the FAST option to look at the threeyear performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>you see the threeyear PE ratio is just overvalued This is a tad easier to swallow even if it doesnt fit my guidelines exactly Because the other metrics show the company is undervalued I would be willing to purchase more shares under The coffee giant wasnt hit nearly as hard as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but it still saw a significant loss in share price Weve bought shares of Starbucks twice at the split adjusted price of and so we are sitting on a solid total gain Starbucks has been on a tear in recent years but Fridays drop in price brought the company back to earth just a little bit This loss also brought the company into a slightly better valuation SP Capital says fair value is lower from Fridays close of However they see shares trading at or higher from here in April of Morningstar finds that the company is currently undervalued FAST Graphs says the current PE ratio of is only a premium to the fiveyear average PE ratio of All told Starbucks is undervalued by our criteria With six years of dividend growth I would like Starbucks to be at least fairly valued In a previous article I stated I would like to own more shares at I will maintain that same price target The largest credit card company in the world was tagged with a loss of under on Friday Visa held up better than both Starbucks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The valuation metrics I use are all over the place on the company FAST Graphs fiveyear PE ratio is and the current PE ratio is This metric says Visa is trading at a premium SP Capital fair value is lower than the closing price of SP Capitals twelvemonth price target is which is just higher from where the stock ended on Friday Morningstar on the other hand is extremely bullish and says fair value is If the stock were to reach this level it would be a gain Combined the metrics say Visa is under fair value Ive only managed to purchase Visa once at a price of so I am eager to add more shares With eight years of dividend growth I am willing to buy shares as long as they are not more than overvalued by our criteria At Visa is within that range for each metric outside of FAST Graphs PE ratio At this price shares of the company would be undervalued on our combined metrics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Starbucks and Visa are dominant players in their part of the economy They have all shown the willingness to pay and raise dividends In retirement these dividends will cover our expenses While we are primarily concerned with dividends and dividend growth we do care about acquiring shares at a reasonable valuation We are eager to add to these holdings and all three of these companies are close to reaching our target price Disclosure I amwe are long MSFT SBUX V I wrote this article myself
