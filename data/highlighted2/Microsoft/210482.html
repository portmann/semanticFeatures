Enterprise subscribers of Office can now get free premium Google Apps for Work subscriptions Google wants to increase the market share of its premium cloudbased productivity apps because Office is increasingly getting more popular Google NASDAQ GOOGL or should I say Alphabet is notching up its campaign against the very popular Office cloudbased productivity suite of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT In a blog post two days ago Rich Rao Google Apps For Work Global Sales chief wants companies with existing Enterprise Agreement EA with another software provider to signup and use the enterprisepremium version of Google Apps until their EAs expire While Rao did not mention it this is a direct campaign against the corporatecentric Office business of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Google is specifically trying to compel existing companies with Office subscriptions to switch for free to Google Apps for Work The free to use offer for Google Apps is only available for corporate clients that are currently paying for Office subscriptions in North America but I expect this to be expanded to other markets too Google will only charge these companies once their current EAs with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or other firms expires Google further sweetened this sweetheart deal by also offering to help pay for part of the deployment costs of switching to Google Apps from Office The Google Apps for Work is already available for dirtcheap subscription fees It wont really be a detrimental contra revenue tactic for Google to offer them for free now to corporate users attached to Office From the usual basic per user monthly fee for Google Apps for Work Alphabet recently reduced it to just per user If we compare Googles two offers to the Business plans of Office the per usermonth Google Apps clearly offers more features than the per usermonth package from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The cheapest Office plan from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt offer free phoneemail tech support or custom business email address In spite of the cheaper costs of subscribing to Google Apps for Work more companies are still favoring Office As per the August report of Bitglass Microsofts Office usage surged from market share in to this year Google Apps only increased its share from to in enterprise cloudbased email and productivity software Please study the chart below from BitGlass Cloud Adoption Report edition In less than a year Microsofts Office outgrew former cloud productivity leader Google Apps for Work in the allimportant enterprise market Bitglass report made it very clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is beating Google when it comes to enterprisecentric cloud applications It is therefore not a surprise that Alphabet is now more aggressive by directly targeting existing subscribers of Office Bitglass found out that of corporations with or more employees already use cloud software suite It is also important to take into account that companies with less than employees are also embracing cloudbased subscriptiononly software for their daily needs The future of office productivity is clearly trending toward the cloud Googles cloudbased software are not as comprehensive or deeplyembedded as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office By giving freetouse untilyouunsubscribefromOffice privileges Google is giving companies the chance to try and be proficient in Google Apps so their workers will find easy to migrate from Office I am long MSFT and GOOG I am endorsing a Buy for these two competing softwareasaservice rivals The cloudcentric approach of providing software and collaborative tools is a growth industry with few players involved Googles aggressive move to try and poach more Office subscribers is therefore decisive A contra revenue approach is justified because Googles cloud apps are not getting adopted as fast as Office is getting welcomed by corporations Please study the chart below out of companies surveyed by Bitglass Microsofts cloud softwareservice package is clearly getting more subscribers In the EMEA regions Microsofts Office has a far higher adoption rate than Google vs In the APAC region Google also trails Microsofts cloud software in terms of corporate adoptions vs The decadesold dependence of many companies on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office gives Office a huge advantage Alphabet therefore has no choice but to do a contra revenue tactic to try and attract more paying customers Google also needs a more robust revenue stream from its cloud apps This extra money could it offset any reduction in advertising revenue arising from the growing use of adblocking software on desktop PCs and mobile devices
