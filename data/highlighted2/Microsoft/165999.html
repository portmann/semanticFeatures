capacity Apple wants to bring Siri closer inline to being competitive with Microsofts Cortana Googles Now and new entrant from Facebook M Apple is at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to machine learning and predictive analysis because of its privacy policies I opine that Apple shouldnt try to be innovative because of its privacy driven disadvantages but simply stay on the heels of the latest developments if it can Its a good thing that Apple NASDAQ AAPL has apparently been aggressively hiring AI specialists VentureBeat is out reporting that a former employee familiar with the matter has observed that Apples AIdevelopment human capital capacity has quadrupled the last several years with a particular focused ramp taking place as of late as it appears that Facebook FB also is going to be putting an increased demand on an already very finite commodity of talent Facebook is out with news that it has been and will continue developing its own humanblended personal assistant tech named M Facebook has as well been aggressive in staffing up its human capital for this vertical and my take on M is that it should force Facebook to continue to do this for the mid term at the very least likely for the long term So Apple being ahead or behind depending on how you view the space of this curve is likely to be helpful to its efforts What are its efforts Apple wants its iPhones of course this likely also includes the entire product ecosystem inclusive of the iPad to be the most predictive and most helpful in the space With underlying hardware being hard to differentiate between devices spare me the Apple has by far the best phones rebuttal full disclosure I use all Apple products the software and more specifically how automated the software of a phonephablettablet can make a users life has become a big point of differentiation This is an area in which many looking objectively will admit that Apple has fallen behind While I dont expect Apples efforts to inject new capacity into Siri to be anything along the lines of what Facebook is trying to accomplish with M I do expect that Apple has quite a few tricks up its sleeve for the next Siri iteration But Apple in all its aesthetics and in all that it does better than everybody else would do well to simply catch up to everybody else Apples Siri is behind Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Now and Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Cortana in a big way in fact I might argue Siri isnt even a good comparison to those two Now as described in the VentureBeat article not all of this is Siris fault or the developer teams fault some of this has to do with Apple itself Its Apple that values privacy over almost anything else Its Apple that has uberlimited storage of learned information and its Apple that wont upload a lot of information to the cloud for group learning Thats like studying weather in one particular region and then extrapolating that data on a global basis While you might be right in some circumstances youre likely not right in many And what happens when the information changes For Apples Siri issues what else is to be expected when working with an incomplete data picture So without knowing if well get an update at Apples upcoming event with regard to if Siri will be getting any immediate term upgrades I think Apple should focus on just playing catchup If Apple can find ways to simply stay just on the heels of new assistant features that should be enough when coupled with Apples reputation for device excellence and its loyal following to capture a large market share I personally think that Apple is focusing not all of a sudden but all of a sudden with such efforts on SiriMachine Learningautomation because Apple is positioning itself to be the device of choice for the nonconsumer segment This is a vertical that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been more than open about wanting to aggressively pursue Without at least a levelplaying assistantpredictive automation operator tech I just dont see how Apple pitches itself to market leadership in nonconsumer mobile I think Apple can definitely do at least levelplaying even while boxing itself into a machine learning corner Again I also think this should be the company focus simply staying on the heels of everybody else But what of the future What of Facebooks M and Microsofts Cortana and its anybodys guess if IBM NYSE IBM is working on a deployable assistant that it wants to license out with a Watson backing this is totally realistic purely speculation at this point There are some things Im sure that just arent going to be doable at scale at Apples scale at least without huge data capture and huge data science This has been something that Apple has already struggled with according to many in the Machine Learning niche VentureBeat polls several sources which conclude this but this is something that is talked about in Austin tech circles often as well and that Ive heard many times I just think that if Apple is serious about taking down nonconsumer like it took down consumer that its going to have to open up its privacy policy even if just simply for the purpose of helping it help users which I think users would be on board with For now though it looks like this is going to be a rare blind spot for Apple one that I think its acknowledging exists with its huge hiring initiative I think this means that Google which has SMBenterprise aspirations as well and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have an early head start also rare for these two in market share opportunity for the nonconsumer vertical Its one that they would be wise not to waste <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has now had two delays for its Surface Hub launch as this market is much much more sticky than the consumer market It will be interesting to watch Apple the next few quarters to see if any updates to Siri are announced in my opinion Hey Siri has been an absolute disaster Apple also might be looking to get aggressive with MA to pull forward RD development It might be worth scanning the SMIDcap and microcap horizons for names that are active and competent in this space for potential exit opportunities While Apples machine learning lag isnt a reason to be concerned about the company right now maybe ever depending on which direction the company leans if Apple wants to compete in nonconsumer this could become a headline issue in the near term Lets hope Apple gets its figured out Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL FB MoreI wrote this article
