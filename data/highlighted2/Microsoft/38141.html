cloud revenue growth of the seventh consecutive quarter of tripledigit growth shows how quickly Nadella is expanding Microsofts cloud capabilities per share seems like the next target for MSFT stock based on fiscal estimates of which puts the forward PE at Personal computers are dead and Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT CEO Satya Nadella wants no part of them at least thats what his cloud vision suggests And investors should rejoice And for that reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock has become a nobrainer to quote Carl Icahn Sure theres still a place in our society for the PC But any notion suggesting that PCs are on a slow decline or may revive at some point ignores whats obvious consumers no longer care about their desktops Its why Facebook NASDAQ FB and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are investing billions each year to grow their mobile ad capabilities And good luck getting a decent search ranking on Google if your website is not mobile friendly or optimized for the smaller screens on smartphones How long will it take before Googles algorithm enforces smaller screens like those on Apples NASDAQ AAPL Apple Watch which officially releases Friday Essentially the PC or various functions of it now fits on your wrist And thats wearables going to become a fastergrowing market than the PC market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>once thrived upon But for now the companys shareholders should rejoice that Microsofts cloudfirst mentality ushered in by Nadella has begun to take shape For that reason investors should be piling in on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock which is down roughly on the year Save for Apple stock theres perhaps no cheaper alternative on the market than <span

discount to the SP which trades at a PE of This means if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>traded on par with the rest of the market the stock would trade today at around higher not Sure Microsofts growth is still tied to the PC That its bulk of revenue and profit comes from Windows and Office may suggest slow growth thus the discounted PE But sales in its commercial division grew to billion in the fiscal third quarter And that commercial cloud revenue grew the seventh consecutive quarter of tripledigit growth shows how quickly Nadella is expanding Microsofts cloud capabilities This means Microsofts commercial cloud segment which comes from its enterprise Office product Dynamic CRM Online as well as its Azure cloud business is now its fastestgrowing segment While the company doesnt reveal exact quarterly or annual revenue figures for the cloud business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does say that the segment is running at an annualized rate of billion Amazon NASDAQ AMZN on Thursday finally revealed its dominant AWS cloud segment generates billion annually Wall Street responded sending Amazon shares up in afterhours Microsofts cloud capabilities should no longer be underestimated Sure theres still ground to make up before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can be mentioned in the same breath as salesforcecom NYSE CRM and IBM NYSE IBM But its cloud performance shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is not being left behind Thus its ridiculous that <span
