NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha I previously said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should fix the bug that allowed techsavvy users to run native Android apps on Lumia phones Project Astoria is for developers only not for general public use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants Lumia phone users to use the official Windows App store not Googles Play Store for inapp purchases I discussed last month that it was possible for techsavvy people to run Android apps on Lumia phones with GB of RAM My suggestion before was for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to immediately plug this hole in the Project Astoria kit Well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has indeed fixed this bugexploit because it is necessary to protect its Lumia and app store business The geeks who could run Android apps were able to use Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Play Store for inapp purchases on cheap Windows enabled hardware like the sub Lumia This was unfair to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>since it is likely subsidizing the low prices of entrylevel Lumia smartphones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>obviously wants Lumia buyers to do exclusive inapp purchases on ported Android games only via the Windows official app store I therefore salute Nadellas quick action to eliminate the said illegalunofficial way to run Android Apps and Google Mobile Services on Windows devices Project Astoria would become a laughingstock for industry observers if it becomes just another channel for Google to make more sales from the Play Store Enabling Google Mobile Services on Lumia handsets also allows Google to track Windows Mobile users personal data for advertising purposes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>urgently needs a more robust app store business to help it offset the lost revenue from giving away free Windows Mobile OS licensing to device manufacturers Project Astoria was supposed to help Android app developers easily port their gamesapplications to the Windows platform Project Astoria is not meant for ordinary people to run native Android apps on their LumiaWindows devices It is pointless for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to sell millions of sub Lumia handsets every year if people buying them will just use Google Play to do their inapp purchases Microsofts ambition was to let Android developers quickly replace the Google Mobile Services API with Microsofts own mobile servicesapp store There are billions of dollars at stake on this matter Google doesnt care if its Android OEM partners kill each other with their racetothebottom price wars Google still makes great money from its cut from the billions of dollars worth of apps and inapp purchases being bought by Android device users The latest App Annie Q report revealed Googles Play Store is now generating higher number of downloads and revenue than Apples NASDAQ AAPL App Store The sheer volume of cheap Android phones being sold daily today has helped Google create a very lucrative app store business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should try and imitate this by continuing its strategy of selling entrylevel Lumia phones to further propagate its own Windows mobile services It is very reassuring to investors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>fixed The Project Astoria bug before Windows Mobile gets it official commercial launch Building up the Windows app store is now a lot easier since app developers will need to actually port their Android apps to Windows if they want to monetize the millions of Lumia device owners It might be better for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to create and release free custom Windows ROMs that will let people install Windows on their Android phones This is a better idea than Lumia Windows device owners being able to run Android apps and Google Mobile Services on their handsets While Project Astoria is free it is not a guarantee that the topgrossing Android app developers will officially port their apps to the Windows Mobile OS platform Majority of the topgrossing Android games are still not available for Windows devices The prompt action of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to stop the illegal use of Lumia to run native Android apps is one more reason to trust Nadella and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>This companys future is now in the good hands of a very reactive management team Under Nadellas management <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now even wise enough to settle antitrust legal suits before they go to trial He was the man who was also aggressive in porting Office to Android and iOS devices Platformagnostic subscriptionbased software sales are now Microsofts great white hope MSFT is a Buy This company has a wide moat and tons of cash reserves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is also a decent dividend giving company with a strong history of doing
