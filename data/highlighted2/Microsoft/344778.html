extremely quiet Perhaps many traders have already gone on holiday Stocks were little changed and not much was happening in other markets such as oil NYSEARCA USO either As far as market outlook you can reread Mondays Briefing nothing has changed in my mind So with that preamble out of the way onto todays topics My three most controversialunpopular market calls over the past year here at Seeking Alpha have all been fading conventional wisdom on popular stocks My call that Kinder Morgan NYSE KMI was a dividend bubble was the most obviously correct It turns out that even toll roads suffer if the passengers run into inclement economic conditions My Gilead NASDAQ GILD call sell at was similarly unpopular The stock appeared optically cheap But once you dug in further there was much less certainty to the growth upside than the bulls were hoping and the Hep C sales picture has indeed remained muddy going forward New political pressure subsequent to my call has provided additional downside push to the stock Like Gilead Apple looks similar on a fundamental basis Massive cash generation huge dividend hikes and a relatively stable market for a high profit margin product That was and still is all true However Apples one massivelyimportant product is near or perhaps already has peaked Just look at the sorts of warnings weve been getting from some of Apples suppliers lately The company is out of new ideas as Mondays dreadfully bland product announcement event showed Since the passing of Steve Jobs besides a gimmicky watch what sorts of fresh ideas have come out of the company The talk is that Apple has upside from the new cheaper phone that targets India and other such markets As a regretful era BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY bull I remember falling for the sweet talk about how less advanced nations such as Indonesia were going to save the day Howd that turn out And apparently by cannibalizing the iMac it might be able to shore up the iPad line a bit Thats fine but both new products are likely to lower overall operating margins while doing little for overall revenues Lets face a simple if potentially unpleasant fact Smartphones arent really a sphere for innovation anymore Smartphones already do just about everything that of users might want Most of the world including even emerging markets already have decent smartphones Theres not a whole lot of feature phone market left to displace And in wealthy developed markets at this point theres little reason to replace or upgrade your phone The subject only tends to arise when the current one breaks or stops charging Theres no novelty factor to new phones anymore It used to be inevitable that Id have to scroll through many friends Facebook photos of Apple product boxes on Christmases past This recent Christmas zero Even here in Mexico you hardly hear anyone talking excitedly about phones anymore Its a passe product People were disappointed with Apples Monday announcement But really what could they do They arent doing much new or interesting and the products they are going with now people already generally understand Its Amazon NASDAQ AMZN of all companies that has the truly fun and exciting Echo Apple now finds itself stuck in the same rut that hit PCs years ago Remember when Compaq and Dell were highflying stocks Yes there was a time when people were thrilled to buy new PCs and closely watched new product launches in the space Windows XP was released in Despite its age the archaic operating system remained the number two most installed computer operating system as of mid with more than million active users For a product that stopped being standard in thats simply breathtaking At that point less than one year ago XP still had more users than Windows and combined And it had more than four times as many users as the topinstalled Mac operating system Once products stop being innovative people only upgrade when their prior version stops powering up entirely Hardly any regular consumers care when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT updates Windows anymore except in cases such as where the new version was a fiasco at launch Apple will likely still dominate the upperend smartphone market in five years They still run the MP player market now Unfortunately the MP player has collapsed to the point of virtual irrelevance The tablet is quickly heading there as well What happens to Apple when Samsung OTCSSNLF and Xiaomi offer sub smartphones that do everything todays phones can do Since Jobs passing Apple has stopped making products that are cultural touchstones Commoditization and Moores Law will do the rest of the work in returning Apple from its pedestal to becoming just another tech company Now sure Apple still generates a gargantuan amount of cash Its smartphone business will erode over time rather than dropping off a cliff The company may become a master innovator again though its looking increasingly questionable There are ways where an Apple investment could work But you have a very high bar for the worlds largest company to outperform the SP NYSEARCA SPY Its difficult for very large firms to put up respectable revenue growth rates due to their startling size Apple is showing that it is struggling to find the next big thing Without that next big thing its a solid bet to underperform the broader stock market going forward When I hear people saying its a nobrainer long for conservative retirement portfolios I get ugly flashbacks to Kinder Morgan and Gilead Japanese bonds have long been viewed as a perfect short Very smart people have been made to look foolish for many years now touting short Japan as a bulletproof concept So I think many of us have become inoculated to the short Japanese debt trade Its one of those wonky ideas that sounds good but simply doesnt work based on the last years of evidence That said the situation is rapidly transforming into something even more bonkers in recent weeks Please take a moment to reflect on this chart of Japanese year bond yields As you can see the year bond traded between and for the past years This is a very low interest rate and there was a good deal of volatility in there Still keep in mind the change in price required to generate a move Over that span the yield never fell by more than half However since December the yield has fallen by twothirds The former rate has gotten cut to a truly paltry Im hesitant to use the word bubble as it comes to treasury bonds People have been discussing a potential bond bubble in the US since I was in middle school and no pop has come yet its one of those concepts that seems prone to hype That said we may actually have a bubble here as far as Japan goes A bubble broadly defined is when people pay rapidly escalating prices for assets that have zero or an infinitesimal chance of providing reasonable returns This year Japanese paper pays a yield Assuming you dont reinvest interest your starting would throw off a year in interest adding up to a princely at maturity in The year yield is into the negative you lose money holding it Now lets ask ourselves is there any rational outcome where youd want to own Japanese government bonds that yield for a commitment of years Assume you cant sell early otherwise your investment thesis is greater fool which is a mainstay of bubble thinking In a Japan goes into and then stays submerged in a deeper recession scenario the bonds likely eventually default Yes the debt is owed to itself mostly as people love to say But there would be massive societal repercussions if the Japanese government robs its savers to fund the debt If the Japanese cant get the economy turned around over the next year span its quite unlikely the government will still be solvent by year Before you write this off as farfetched the current Japanese economic downturn has been running for years now And the same unrelentingly negative demographic situation continues to weigh heavily today On the upside lets suppose a technological breakthrough sudden permissive attitude toward immigration or other such fortunate event gets the economy solidly back toward economic growth In this case inflation should also pick up Even if it gets back to just your yielding bond is a gigantic loser Once you get as far as years out its hard to see a scenario where Japan doesnt either go into a deflationary default spiral or things start to perk up triggering inflation The government could also try monetizing the debt with money printing which would cause your bonds to get crushed by inflation without necessarily even helping the economy I get that bonds are insurance But at a certain price you have to ask what am I insured against Compared to cash its really hard to make a rational or logical argument for owning this year paper The yield provides the thinnest of reward in return for taking large risk of both default and inflationary shocks I suspect most buyers are technical or swing traders that are in fact buying because they imagine they can sell it at a higher price in the near future If so there will be great pain when the music stops If you want to short Japanese government bonds there is a leveraged inverse ETF NYSEARCA JGBD though as always the usual caveats apply for that fund structure Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
