October which may include Intelbased Windows smartphones Although a Windows Phone with Intel Inside would be an improvement over the Lumia line these phones still wont be competitive with Apples iPhone s Microsofts October event to announce new Windows devices has stimulated speculation that these might include an upgraded line of Windows Phones featuring Intel processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT moving to an all Intel NASDAQ INTC platform for PCs tablets and phones would be great for both companies and for consumers However Intelbased phones cannot hope to compete in the same league as Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone s until late at the earliest The deficiency in Intels current Atom line up relative to Apples iPhone and s was brought home to me indirectly by an article by SA contributor Alcaraz Research which argued I think persuasively that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should abandon the legacy Lumia brand for a premium line of phones to be marketed under the Surface brand Alcaraz also argued once again correctly that these phones would have to be based on Intel processors in order to be full fledged Windows devices capable of exploiting the Continuum feature I agree that this is the only path forward for Windows phone If Microsofts mobile devices arent part of the larger Intelbased Windows ecosystem theyre no where Such phones Alcaraz asserts could rival the iPhone s Perhaps Alcaraz doesnt specify a time frame in which said rivalry might occur or what Intel processor could reasonably support that rivalry There is no Intel processor currently available that could The difficulty Intel based phones have in being competitive with iPhone can be seen in the Asus ZenFone highlighted in another Alcaraz article The ZenFone has been out for a while and has been thoroughly reviewed by Anandtech The ZenFone runs Intel Moorefield processors fabricated on Intels somewhat older nm process In most of the CPU and GPU benchmarks that Anandtech ran last years iPhone was superior to the ZenFone What about Intels newer Atom x series of SoFIA smartphone SOCs Even Intel isnt trying to position these in the premium tier as the chart below from Anandtech shows Intels x processors use the same CPU core design Silvermont as the Morefield processor in the ZenFone but theyre fabricated on a less competitive nm node by TSMC NYSE TSM The Atom x and x series are fabricated on Intels most advanced nm process and feature Airmont Silvermont with die shrink cores and enhanced GPUs Wouldnt the x be competitive with iPhone s Perhaps but it really isnt targeted for smartphones as it is for tablets as the chart below shows Not only would the x be inappropriate for a smartphone primarily because of battery life but its unlikely that it would outperform the A in the iPhone s The Atom x has been thoroughly tested in the new Surface by Anandtech In most of the benchmarks where the iPad Air could be compared the iPad Air which features last years AX SOC performed better than the Surface Apple has claimed roughly a improvement on CPU performance and a improvement on GPU performance for the A relative to the A as I have noted in a recent article I havent seen any independent test data on the A yet but if Apples claims hold up Apples A will be the worlds fastest smartphone SOC even including the Atom x So the competitive landscape for Apple through the end of the year is that its top phones will offer unrivaled performance compared to any smartphone at any price point The iPhone s and s Plus will also come with the latest generation iOS and enjoy all the benefits of the iOS ecosystem This is unlikely to alter until Intel moves the Atom x series to its own nm process in Even then this next x series will probably not equal the performance of the A since we already have a reasonable expectation of performance improvement from the move to nm by virtue of the Atom x and x There really is no reason to expect Intel based phones to achieve performance parity with the latest iPhone until Intel completely redesigns the CPU and GPU cores for Atom which probably wont be until late I often encounter the opinion expressed by Apple critics that Apples pricing of their iPhones is all driven by marketing hype When I point to objective metrics such as processor speed the reply all too often is that these metrics dont matter The consumer doesnt care about them its asserted Im sure that most consumers dont base buying decisions on benchmark scores but they do base decisions on user experience Processing speed does affect user experience So does operating system reliability and convenience Since the introduction of Apples first bit smartphone SOC the A in the iPhone s Apple has maintained a consistent lead in smartphone processor performance Most people point to the larger screen of the iPhone as the most important factor in Apples iPhone sales growth in fiscal Apples faster SOCs were critical enablers to those larger screens Without the faster processors the massive increase in screen pixels in the iPhone and Plus would have led to noticeable performance degradation The faster processors were essential to provide the fast and fluid experience that iOS users are accustomed to on the larger screens Although Apple critics may not be realistic about why Apple has been able to occupy the top tier in smartphones I doubt that Apples competitors have any illusions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO Nadella strikes me as both extremely intelligent and realistic On October <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may well abandon the last vestiges of the failed Nokia strategy with a line of Intel based phones But I doubt it will be positioning them as iPhone killers Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
