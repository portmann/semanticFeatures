</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has acknowledged that Windows will not reach the goal of billion users by In order to convert existing Windows users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will need a Windows OS that is better than either Windows or Windows Last Friday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT officially acknowledged that it wouldnt meet its goal of billion Windows users by This was commendable openness and very characteristic of CEO Satya Nadellas management style Left open was the question of how or when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will reach its goal Hopefully investors will get insight into this in the upcoming earnings report on July The news didnt come as a great surprise Following Microsofts March quarter earnings report I had expressed skepticism that Windows could reach the billion user goal before it was time for the next version of Windows With a year cycle for major Windows releases time would run out by about Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has touted that adoption of Win has been the fastest in history most of the current users have come from new PC sales Since the release of Win in July there have been million total sales of new PCs globally according to IDC quarterly reports Excluding Apple NASDAQ AAPL Mac sales about million were Windows PCs This means that only about million out of the estimated billion Windows users have taken advantage of the free Win upgrade Its been an uphill battle to win over existing Windows users to the new operating system My simple thesis about this is that Windows overall just isnt as good as Windows This is despite offering new features such as the Windows Store and Cortana Certainly Windows remains my personal favorite of all operating systems available in the world today including the latest macOS Although my personal take can only be viewed as anecdotal it probably reflects the views of the larger body of Windows users My basic problem with Win has been its split personality The lack of visual and UI cohesion between desktop mode and tablet mode continues to be a source of annoyance and occasional consternation I continue to believe that Microsofts approach of convergence offering a single OS for desktop convertible tablet and smartphone is the right answer I continue to believe that it should be possible to offer a nearly seamless experience across all devices It just hasnt been done yet by anyone Given the limitations of Win there just hasnt been much motivation to upgrade for existing desktop users of Win and this is reflected in current usage as found by netmarketsharecom As of June Windows usage share was found to be This amounts to at least million global users of Win Just allowing more time for Win to gain converts isnt going to get to the goal It remains to be seen what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will do in response It could just declare end of life for Win in and kick everyone off the platform This would probably result in a significant backlash from Win users and I dont expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to do this What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has to do is offer a new OS thats genuinely better than either Win or Win Thats a tall order but Im convinced that it can be done and probably will be in the next release It would be helpful to investors if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offered some guidance as to it OS roadmap Windows Surface Phone the Need is Now Almost all reactions to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>acknowledgment have also pointed to the lack of mobile presence as part of the problem This has been a central concern of mine for some time The idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>didnt need a smartphone was just silly considering how important the devices have become In my recent article on Surface Phone rumors I found encouragement in the concept of a Surface Phone Surface Phone would be a premium <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>designed device along the lines of the Surface Pro I love the concept and believe it could rejuvenate Microsofts smartphone sales This is especially true because Continuum is a great feature that allows the smartphone to be converted easily into a desktop mode platform Given the increasing power of smartphone processors this is a usage model that I believe will be compelling for many consumers with modest computing needs Its probably the lowest cost PC computing platform one could imagine and therefore could be compelling in emerging markets where consumers cant afford multiple devices Given the complete collapse of the sales of the old Nokiadesigned Lumia phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>badly needs the Surface Phone to get back in the game Unfortunately most rumors about Surface Phone point to a H release Why is it taking so long There may be a silver lining in this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may be waiting for the next generation of Intel NASDAQ INTC mobile processors based on its next generation nm process Althought Intel has discontinued its current generation of mobile Atom processors for smartphones and tablets the Atom X series the nm node may allow Intel to get back in mobile An Intel processor in the Surface Phone would be very welcome to Windows users since it would greatly expand the software available for the Phone in desktop mode This is all speculation right now but I think it makes sense given where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to go The Surface line has demonstrated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can do mobile devices and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>desperately needs a smartphone Every earnings season focus tends to be on Cloud services since this is a clear strength for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still has a very substantial Windows OS and device business including Surface OEM licensing and Xbox that still accounts for the lions share of its revenue Last quarter More Personal Computing was about of revenue the largest of any segment Now that its been acknowledged that Win isnt going to make the billion user goal investors really need to hear what the game plan is to reach the goal Hopefully that plan involves a new Windows Itll be interesting to hear what if anything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has to say on this subject at the conference call tomorrow I continue to regard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a strong hold I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from
