Apple still dreams of a better camera for the iPhone MingChi Kuo of KGI Securities already hinted last January that Intel NASDAQ INTC will supply baseband or LTE modems to the iPhone in I do not agree with Kuos musing that ARMbased Mac OS X computers will soon be released However the recent rumor that Apple NASDAQ AAPL will use an Intel XMM LTE modem for some iPhone models intended for emerging markets fortifies Kuos speculation over baseband processors If we look at the chart below released by KGI Securities Kuo predicts that Intel will supply basebandwireless components to of the iPhone production in Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM which is still the sole supplier of baseband parts this year will supply its LTE modems to of the iPhone production next year Kuos speculation that Apple will use different wireless modems for its iPhone in is not supported by Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin Bajarin claims that if Apple will really switch baseband processor supplier it will do so on a universal basis Intel could really benefit if Apple completely drops Qualcomm in favor of the XMM An IHS teardown of iPhone models reveals that the basebandwireless components gives Qualcomm around per iPhone Apple sold more than million iPhones during its most recent quarter Even if Intel prices the XM at the huge amount of iPhones that Apple sell per year could help Intel erase the big losses of its Mobile division Apple sold million iPhones last year and Adam Levy of Motley Fool argues that the company can sell million iPhones this year Even if Bajarin is wrong about his universal switch speculation and we use MingChi Kuos estimate Intels future benefit from iPhone baseband processors still comes around to million x million units Winning the supply rights to the iPhones wireless section is even more lucrative than supplying the processor The screenshot below shows that the XMM like Qualcomms MDM modem inside the iPhone also supports LTEAdvanced and Carrier Aggregation But the MDM is allegedly only a category LTE modem limited to Mpbs download speed The XMM is Category modem that can deliver up to Mbps speed on LTEFDDTDD networks The iPhone Could Use The Camera From Intel Another important component which Intel could supply inside the iPhone is the camera Looking at the chart of IHS above we can see that the cameras of the iPhone costs around in the iPhone and in the iPhone Plus Winning the camera slot of the next iPhone could give Intel another to revenue from every iPhone sold Intels revolutionary RealSense SnapShot technology might be what Apple need to make its iPhone become a real alternative to compact digital cameras The iPhone has a very powerful bit A processor but people are still not satisfied with its old MP cameras The experts says Apple has failed to keep up with the competition when it comes to resolution and picture quality of other smartphone cameras The big inch design of the iPhone plus means the three cameras that Intel uses for its RealSense SnapShot technology could fit at the backside of future iPhones and iPads The Lytrolike quality of Intel RealSense SnapShot camera technology can help people manipulate the focus of their pictures after they already taken the shot The depthsensing ability of RealSense SnapShot can help iPhone users create wonderful Bokeh effect which professional photographers usually can only achieve using expensive lenses like the Canon EF mm f USM lens Dell already used the RealSense SnapShot camera in the mmthin Venue Series Android tablet CNET claims the SnapShot camera of the Dell Venue makes it an innovative photography gadget Toms Hardware also praises the RealSense SnapShot camera of the Dell Venue However a smartphone is still more convenient to use than an inch tablet when it comes to taking photographs Apple can use the Optical Image Stabilization found in the iPhone Plus to complement Intels RealSense SnapShot Samsungs upcoming Galaxy S will feature a MP camera with Optical Image Stabilization but it still wont be able to match the D depthsensing capability of Intels RealSense SnapShot Intel can worm itself inside the iPhone even if Apple continues to ignore the nanometer Atom X The possibility of replacingjoining Qualcomm as the iPhones baseband processor supplier could help Intel reduce its contrarevenue expenses on mobile chips The ripple effect of an Apple endorsement of the XMM could also inspire other smartphone vendors to drop Qualcomm for Intel Qualcomm still dominates the LTE baseband processor market with market share However Intels investment in Spreadtrum Communications could decrease Qualcomms share Intel and Spreadtrum are already among the top five vendors of multimode LTE modems Spreadrum has G and G baseband processors which are popular among Chinese manufacturers of lowcost Android phones and tablets A twoprong attack against Qualcomms modems for highend and lowend smartphones is a great tactic for Intel Furthermore my argument that Intels RealSense D camera technology could help Apple is supported by recent actions of the iPhone company Apple again filed a patent for a new way to improve the optical image stabilization of mobile phone cameras Patently Apple has a list of patents that Apple filedowns which exposes Apples strong desire to come up with better cameras for iOS devices It is true that Apple already filed for a patent on a D camera last December However Intels RealSense camera is already available for immediate use I hope that Tim Cook takes a look at a RealSense SnapShot camera Intels invention is a very intelligent addition to any smartphone The RealSense SnapShot can duplicate the Bokeh effect of a Canon lens after the photo has already been taken INTC is a Buy Look at the chart below with or without Apples approval of the XMM Intel is still a dividend aristocrat that is patently underpriced compared to its semiconductor peers In spite of Intels recent reduction of its Q revenue estimate there are still analysts at TipRanks who share my Buy recommendation for INTC First Quarter PC sales always drop significantly since If <span style='background-color:
