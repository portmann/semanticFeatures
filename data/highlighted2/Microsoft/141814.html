class='textDiv'>Apples Fall Why Its A Buy Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Compared to the market Apples earnings are a bargain for the price Competitiveness as quantified objectively in gross margins and market segment dominance remains high Following its last earnings report Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL has suffered a headlinedrawing price drop thats left it more than below its recent alltime high Is this the beginning of the end for Apple Or is this another colossal misunderstanding This article explains why the value case for Apple is only strengthened by the postearnings selloff Before the recent selloff The Jaded Consumers bull case for Apple rested on a multilegged stool of low marginal costs from high vertical integration high profits from dominance of the best market segments and high quality maintained by regular investment in the technologies that differentiate Apples products so as to enable premium pricing at the top end The evidence this effectively set Apple ahead of competitors historically rested on surveys of Apples customers keeping customers and building personal recommendations as an advertising method both depend on customer reaction to the products performance in everyday use and to prove this had a realworld effect on Apples bottom line Apples profit share Yes profit share Sales share is for chumps Ask Nokia Corp NYSE NOK which while it remained in the handset business was losing money despite <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corp NASDAQ MSFT forking over tendigit subsidies to prolong it in the business of selling Windows Phone hardware When eventually as Nokia lay on life support <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>found it necessary to buy the company in order to keep its Windows Phone units rolling off the assembly line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>found itself no more capable than Nokia to make money selling units below cost Hence the recent job bloodbath and the billion postpurchase writedown To put the billion writedown in perspective consider that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>last quarter alone wrote Nokiarelated goodwill down from billion to million a dramatic reduction and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in just last year bought Nokias devices business for billion Now as ever mobile hardware remains a brutal business Or ask an Android vendor The world market share of Android is frequently cited as evidence Android owns the future Even if the future takes a long time to arrive is this the beginning of the end for Apple If Apples future lay in international markets then what should be made of Androids dominant share abroad Traditionally the attack on Apple has grown from concerns that Apples competitors are catching up on quality Apples product differentiation is shrinking and Apple will inevitably descend into lowmargin unitshare competition a game people saw Apple lose on the s against Microsofts Windows OEMs Is this movie about to repeat Technical analysts were quick to point out that Apples latest decline pushed share prices below their day moving average which should they say give any investors a cause for concern Value investing isnt about plotting stock price chart graphs Peter Lynch author of One Up On Wall Street famously said that charts are great for predicting the past Warren Buffett has alternately said that charts looked the same to him upsidedown or that he realized pricechartgazing didnt work when I turned the charts upside down and didnt get a different answer From a value perspective cheaper prices could mean all kinds of things the market catching on to a dud or foolish sellers dumping a longterm winner Remember when Buffett bought a American Express NYSE AXP after the salad oil scandal hit The abrupt stock drop represented an overreaction creating a buy opportunity thats increased Berkshire Hathaways NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB yield on the shares ever since So is that Apple now Or is Apple the next Motorola for which Yahoo delightfully lists a share price of want some or Nokia once top the mobile world but descending now into irrelevance To answer that one tries to look at the world like Lynch and Buffett to compare the price to what the companys worth First lets compare the price of Apples earnings to the price one must pay to get the same earnings from the broader market Compared to the estimated PricetoEarnings ratio of at the time of writing for the SP is Apple frighteningly expensive Apples trailing PE seems closer to than to making its earnings cheaper A chart of PE based on forward earnings involves the uncertainty of others estimates but it provides a PE less than The real question is whether products like the AppleTV and Apple Watch provide some kind of weathervane into Apples future is the company done If onlookers dont see that its about to fall off a cliff the forward PE they project might not mean much more than a Motorola stock certificate So lets have a look at the factors that lead to earnings at Apple and see how those are looking Apples historical profit originally came from computers then music products a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>employee once asked me why Apple didnt close down its computer business to sell iPods bless his heart then most recently smartphones Currently nearly two thirds of Apples global revenues are iPhone revenues which are in turn the vast majority of Apples revenues from iOS Although the App Store historically led Google Incs NASDAQ GOOGL Google Play in revenue weve been hearing for years that the sheer size of Googles installed base and its growing Google Play revenue will cause it to inevitably surpass the App Store in software sales just as Androids vast unit sales have made iOS devices a minority worldwide And hows that played out In the App Store lead on Google Play actually widened Moreover Googles mobile revenues dont come primarily from its huge Android installed base Apples iOS ecosystem is so valuable it now drives of Googles mobile revenue But Apples revenues arent primarily postsales revenues even in markets rich with postsales opportunities like the mobile market Unlike Google whose position in mobile is predominantly a platform vendor with costs and benefits deriving from the platform rather than hardware Apple makes its real money as a hardware vendor Every year huge rivals roll out hardware intended to take Apples premium customers with justcheaper devices Its a dogeatdog world Why Apple s lastannounced quarter was so tough its revenues were up only and its earnings per share up only For those of you who dont own Apple shares and think the pershare numbers dont matter Apples last quarter netted it billion Isnt that sad Are those vultures circling No wait Doubledigit revenue growth and profit growth outstripping revenues This isnt a company whose margins are collapsing to keep unit sales share this is a company thats widening its margins Expanding its hardware margins is exactly the kind of thing that proves Apple retains its position in the mobile hardware catbird seat The iPhone models that drove up Apples average selling price ASP for iPhones earlier this year have continued to bear fruit driving Apples June quarters iPhone ASP up over the prioryear quarter to While Apples perunit prices rose its edge on margins endured Samsung OTCSSNLF charges less than Apple for its Galaxy S but spends more money building each phone Part of this may be that Samsungs got a huge fabrication plant to keep occupied an overhead cost Apple avoids by bidding fabricators against one another to keep unit prices down The fact Samsung sells a nice big phone doesnt mean it can make as much money as Apple on them which means its got to sell even more of them just to match Apples profit Since the postsales revenue from Samsungs phone falls largely in Googles coffers keeping up with Apple is a tough task for mobile hardware competitors even ones as successful as Samsung Samsungs relatively modest unit sales on its highestend models make it risky to invest in custom CPUs so Samsung buys an offtheshelf part from the same suppliers that serve its Android competitors Investing in differentiating features is challenging for a company that must deploy an externallycontrolled Android platform in order to access the marketplace even before considering the financial risk If Apple lends a halfbillion dollars to a sapphire vendor that cant meet its yield demands it can simply repurpose the facility that secured its loan into a data center After all Apples backend services require more data centers so whats to lose For Apple whose vertically integrated business reaches further uphill than competitors whose product stops at the hardware the risk of billiondollar bets is just not that frightening Apples scale creates opportunities competitors just dont have reducing Apples risk on projects competitors would rationally avoid So its no surprise Apple is preparing phones with features like forcetouch intended to train users to expect interface features competitors wont easily offer uniformly across their product lines Differentiation may really affect the way some games work but it may also create subtle differences in interface behavior that make other products fee different unexpected and alien thereby raising customer reluctance to switch For Apple this is a cheap improvement it can leverage with some inhouse software adaptation For competitors Not so much Likewise Apple faces little barrier in picking up tech firms like Anobit a fabless semiconductor firm that designs memory controllers Apple can deploy across its entire product lineup reducing its component costs by owning more of the technology it deploys and enabling it to use components that with lesser controllers would provide iffy performance If Apple can save money owning tech that allows it to use cheaper parts why not drop a few hundred million By steadily investing in technology that maintains both Apples differentiation and its margins advantage Apple helps maintain the math behind its profit engine And remember its earnings not unit volume that matters Its not unit price alone or unit sales alone but the maximized product of unit margins and unit sales that keeps Apple at the top of the top end A few years ago Apple made headlines making of the worlds mobile profits with its minority market share Far from suffering erosion of its dominant position Apple has solidified its hold Apple now earns of the operating income reaped by the worlds top eight smartphone vendors up from a year ago Its even up from the of global smartphone profit Apple took in the last calendar quarter of when it first launched its current phone model This isnt based on Apples industrycrushing mobile software revenue but is limited solely to the applestoapples comparison of hardware revenues between hardware vendors Apple adds to this revenue the ad income earned when its customers shop Last Black Friday smartphones drove just over a third of all online sales traffic Apples iOS devices smartphones and tablets drove of total online traffic more than double all Android devices aggregate traffic of When an Android customer did make a purchase Apples customer trounced it with an average order size larger than an Android customers While other smartphone vendors dont generally share in this postsales revenue Apple gets to compete not just with the hardware vendors its trouncing but with the platform vendors and search vendors who pay for access to Apples premium customers Reportedly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Yahoo Inc NASDAQ YHOO are vying for the defaultsearch position on Apples products when the deal with Google expires Contrary to reports that sales of Apple Watch collapsed to fewer than watches per day after an initial sales surge Tim Cook reported in July that Apples accelerating sales had made June its best sales month yet But honestly since when did we think wristwatches were going to beat computers in revenue much less smartphones The Apple Watch is an interesting piece of tech that allows Apple more involvement in its users everyday lives unlocking hotel rooms paying for groceries but its never contributed materially to Apples bottom line The AppleTV business nobody talks about is of greater strategic value to embedding Apple in homes providing media content and potentially coordinating home automation Between AppleTV and video sales its a billion dollar business already On the other hand does anybody else sell tens of thousands of smartwatches per day The big revenue drivers at Apple are not only resisting attack theyre extending their moats to fend off encroachment From about million iPhone units in the yearago quarter Apple grew unit volume past million units while raising average sales price and expanding its competitive position in margins Apple isnt a company losing its grip on its competitive position its a company carefully executing a profitmaximizing strategy to sell enormous unit volumes on Spartan production costs at prices that reflect its products quality and their differentiation in the marketplace The proof Apples product is differentiated is its price a commodity product would not command Apples premium pricing And far from being subject to commodity pricing pressure Apples seen customers intentionally pay extra to shop up Apples product line raising their average purchase price Apple products are not a collapsing fad theyre a competitive powerhouse Apples headlinedriven price route represent a bargain both to Apples recent prices and to the broader market Whatever traders may conclude from the squiggly lines on their charts Apple shares remain a represent a buy for
