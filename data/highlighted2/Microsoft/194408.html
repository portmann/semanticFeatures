style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google continue to try to emulate Apples integrated mobile device model Apple mobile devices continue to be superior because Apples design expertise is much deeper than its competitors Now that Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL have all debuted their new mobile devices for the December quarter its time for investors to step back and assess their overall impact While some may portray the new devices from Apples competitors as threats Apple has continued to thrive and grow despite these threats which are introduced year after year The reason for this is due to a fundamental structural difference Apples competitors have yet to emulate Both Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have amassed huge bases of users for their operating systems based on the commodity PC model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still has a user base for Windows it claims is about billion strong Likewise Google claims to have billion Android users Under the circumstances one has to wonder why Apples competitors field their own branded mobile devices The answer of course is profitability Selling mobile devices with Apples unique hardware and operating systems turns out to be the best way to monetize Apples operating systems Apple is well known to reap most of the smartphone industry profits Apple generally charges a premium for all its devices and its mobile devices have become its main revenue source Apples revenue and profit now dwarf that of its competitors despite having fewer users for iOS and Mac OS X The device events of Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google have served to underscore that theres a missing element in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google devices that is present in Apples mobile devices This is the custom system on chip SOC that powers all iPhones iPads Apple TVs and iPods Touch The lack of ability to design their own custom SOCs relegates the smartphones of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google to immediate secondtier status Both Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>based their flagship phones the Nexus P and the Lumia XL on the Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon Ive pointed out that the is about a year behind the latest A SOC in the iPhone ss Plus and about half as fast Nevertheless the commodity manufacturers had to use it because it was simply the best currently available off the shelf Rumors that the suffers from overheating seemed to be confirmed by Microsofts claim to use tablet class liquid cooling for its new Lumia phones The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>did not put an Intel NASDAQ INTC SoFIA now Atom X processor in its flagship phones also says a lot Despite claims by ardent Intel supporters that Intel could build a competitive with Apple processor they have yet to do so Microsofts decision to use Qualcomm QCOM must have been a difficult one in light of Windows and its Continuum feature which was demonstrated on the Lumia XL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>showed how the XL could support a desktop mode of Win when docked with an external monitor keyboard and mouse Its a cool feature but of limited value since the phone can only run Universal apps that are compiled to run on the Qualcomm processor The larger app ecosystem of Windows software is still off limits This is basically the same situation that existed with Windows RT running on ARMbased Surface tablets And Windows RT is now extinct Continuum on an ARMbased Lumia phone continues to be a promise of future capability that is largely unfulfilled Until it is Microsofts Windows phones will be as undistinguished as their predecessors and suffer the same fate of minuscule market share Likewise Googles Nexus phones have failed to achieve even the topfive status in IDCs market results such as for the June quarter Despite losing market share Apple is still the dominant player in tablets as IDC confirms for the June quarter Apple had the largest tablet market share at As usual Googles Nexus tablets dont even make the top of IDCs survey and neither do Microsofts At the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>event it was revealed that Surface is a billion a year business but this is hardly impressive Apple still sells more than this in iPads every quarter Once again the use of commodity processors hurts the offerings from both Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Googles Nexus uses the Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Tegra K Denver This is a very respectable tablet processor but the Nexus still tests out behind the iPad Air in most benchmarks as an Anandtech review shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has gone a different route with the Surface Pro series now updated with the Surface Pro By using Intel Core i and i processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>guarantees that the tablets will have the best performance as well as full backward compatibility with Windows software The cost is bulk and heft The Surface Pro weighs pounds vs pounds for the iPad Pro despite the iPad Pros larger inch screen The Surface Pro is also thicker at mm vs the iPad Pros mm Surface Pro requires a cooling fan while the iPad Pro does not Surface Pro uses the latest Intel Skylake processors so it should be a pretty fast machine in i and i form Given the early results of the A processor in the iPhone s the AX in the iPad Pro should be pretty fast as well When iPad Pro goes on sale in November the world may discover that Apple has built an SOC to rival even the mighty Intel Core iX series processors But even with that I would concede that the Surface Pro is the better general purpose personal computer by virtue of running Win Does that mean that Surface Pro will sell better than iPad Pro Probably not As a tablet the Surface Pro is a little too heavy while as a laptop replacement its still a little underpowered Some may be disappointed that the iPad Pro is not a better general purpose personal computer or better able to run applications available for Windows or Mac OS X This has always been true of iOS devices yet iOS has thrived nevertheless iOS apps have allowed the iOS ecosystem to thrive in its own right and iPad Pro is clearly intended to give iOS developers a better platform to create compelling apps rather than serve as a replacement for the laptop Apple doesnt need for Windows and Mac OS X developers to port their apps to iOS although theyre welcome to do so The developer community for iOS is now so large and profitable that virtually every target market is being served within the iOS ecosystem Legacy PC developers such as Adobe NASDAQ ADBE are not really needed for iOS to flourish This is illustrated by the situation with iPad in the enterprise iPad still commands a huge market share according to Good Technology Is this because iPad serves as a substitute for Windows or Mac OS X systems No Its because enterprises are deploying them to run apps in situations where the use of the tablet form factor is a true advantage An example of this is the flight charts that United Airlines pilots use Most of the uses for iPad in the enterprise involve special purpose apps developed by third parties or by the enterprises themselves This has been the focus of the IBM NYSE IBM partnership as well This highlights the advantages of stability and security offered by iOS as well as the ease of developing apps using the free development environment Apple makes available Every year when Apples competitors field a new set of mobile devices Apple bears assert that these constitute a grave threat to Apples leadership position It has become a tried and true formula And who can really take issue with the literal use of the word threat since it only speaks to possible rather than certain outcomes Apple will always face competitive threats Thats the nature of a free market Investors deserve to hear more from analysts than the mere fact that a threat exists since this is a trivial observation What is the extent of the threat posed to Apple by its competitors mobile devices The threat is not market share since neither Google nor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have significant market share currently Neither Google nor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are likely to gain significant market share in mobile devices since these devices are inherently undistinguished commodity devices and dont represent significant advances from previous devices that also failed to gain market share The only other way in which Apple could be threatened is in profitability Once again Apples position as a premium mobile device provider is not really under threat The past few years have demonstrated that commodity devices simply cannot threaten Apples premium devices because they lack the hardware and software discriminators that would be necessary We only use your contact details to reply to your request for
