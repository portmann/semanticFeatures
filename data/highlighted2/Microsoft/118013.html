the buyback may result in a share price of The stock price of Apple NASDAQ AAPL is estimated by using the currently published share buyback program and assuming a constant market value Considering that the share price may hit in March up by from the current price of By additionally assuming a PE of the price may hit Currently Apple is in a blackout period that lasts until the day after it announces its earnings on July Thus the company is not allowed to buy back stock The black out period is five weeks before every earnings announcement Apple share price broke down from the narrow trading range it had been trading in this quarter and hit the day moving average before pulling back The Apple share price is shown in the figure below source Etrade line shows day moving average Also seen in the graphic is that the volume has increased substantially This behavior has been seen before as recently as last November figure below source Etrade upper line is day and lower day moving averages Then the stock was trading in the range of to until slowing down and then moving up to a higher trading range of to Then it broke down twice in the blackout period in January before a record sales of iPhone were reported and the stock moved into the current trading range of to One may assume that the stock is showing the same behavior now after breaking down from the current trading range and testing the day moving average before it moves up to a higher trading range where would be the lower level If Apple posts good numbers next week then this is a likely scenario but bad numbers might keep the stock in the current trading range Note analysts expect good numbers this quarter as iPhone sales have remained unusually strong see SocGen upgrades Apple hike FQ iPhone estimates The forecasted EPS for Apple is and for current fiscal year and respectively Historically Apples stock price has traded in the PE ratio range of to for the trailing months figure below Etrade except for the period in when it dropped below as a result of a reduction in iPhone sales The stock price next year for a PE ratio of to may be to respectively If we look only at the recent narrow range of to the price range may be to For comparison Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has a PE of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has a PE of Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM a PE of HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ a PE of and Samsung Electronics OTCSSNLF a PE of The current growth in sales is compared with sales This is mainly due to increased market share and a record number of Android users switching over to iPhone according to Tim Cook Apple earnings call The iPhone has been very strong in China market share in May despite many cheap but good Android phones available there Another interesting fact is that Apple had market share for people earning to RMB to per month iPhone Plus sells for RMB thus there is no indication that although car sales are contracting that people will buy cheaper phones Currently about of Apples revenue comes from China and thus the impact would be small on total sales China car sales peaked in January this year and have been trending down since or about in May see figure below source Statista According to recent rumors Huawei will produce the next Nexus Android phone Its the first time that Google picked a Chinese manufacturer and indicates that Google also is focusing on the Chinese market But Huawei phones are competing with Xiaomi Lenovo and Android rather than Apple as people switch between Android phones more easily Samsung is also rumored to be introducing the new Galaxy Note in midAugust from September to get ahead of Apple before their introduction of iPhone S This also is an indication that their new flagship Galaxy S has not been selling as expected The main risks for Apple going forward are high expectations after such a strong turnaround since loosing market share to Android before the bigger iPhones went on sale and a growth in earnings Currently though expectations seem tampered and the media coverage last week was negative Sherri Scribner senior tech analyst at Deutsche Bank Research who last year downgraded Apple to Hold said that Apple was out of surprises and trading near all time high making it more difficult to outperform expectations Now she says Apple has growth this year and thus it will be hard to pick up growth next year and predicts that Apple will underperform next year underperform is the lowest grade and thus it cant be downgraded further by Deutsche Bank Analyst mean price target is The Apple Watch seems to have reduced substantially in online sales from its introduction in the US source Slice but its not known how it is doing in other parts of the world or in direct store sales in the US Apple initially didnt expect as much demand and the demand now is probably closer to their expectations The iPhone sold million units in its first two quarters and million the first year of sales The impact on earnings is small as the margin on the watches is negative according to Tim Cook in the last earnings call Apple earnings call Apple has decided to return some of that cash they have been hoarding by buying back the shares and thus reducing the share float In April they announced a billion buyback through March To estimate the effect on the future share price by assuming a constant market value billion diluted the share buybacks are distributed evenly shown in green in the figure below Then the share price would increase from to or as shown with the black dashed line If we assume a PE ratio of and increase from share buyback the share price might be in the beginning of The impact of the share buyback calculated from Apple earnings releases The red columns show the decreasing shares and the green columns the cumulative share buyback left axis The black line shows the average share price and the dashed line the calculated share price increase due to the buyback if the market value would remain unchanged from the current price right axis USD Net share settlement new share rewards and options to employees was only of the cumulative total at March this year The high increase in buyback should lower this ratio to less than next year This is quite low for Apple compared to many tech firms that lower expenses with stock issues to employees Its doubtful that the increasing market share trend will suddenly stop in China or that the world market share will hit a ceiling ie which is still much lower than Android or that there will be no new markets to penetrate ie India and Africa The biggest threat to Apples share price are high expectations and constant worries from analysts but none of them is hardly expecting another year of such a spectacular growth and neither am I But its important for every investor looking at a stock receiving this much attention to know the risks and the negatives as there is less risk of exuberant expectations and prices to develop In light of the recent earning hikes from analysts I wouldnt be surprised that after all Icahn would turn out to be correct and that earnings will be above this
