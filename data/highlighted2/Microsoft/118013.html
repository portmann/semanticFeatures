The current growth in sales is 40% compared with 2014 sales.This is mainly due to increased market share and a record number of Android users switching over to iPhone according to Tim Cook ( Apple earnings call ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The iPhone has been very strong in China (22% market share in May 2015 ) despite many cheap but good Android phones available there. (Uncertainty) </span>Another interesting fact is that Apple had 25% market share for people earning $320 to $650 (RMB 2,000 to 4,000 per month, iPhone 6 Plus sells for RMB 6,088), thus there is no indication that although car sales are contracting that people will buy cheaper phones.Currently about 16% of Apple's revenue comes from China and thus the impact would be small on total sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>China car sales peaked in January this year and have been trending down since or about 27% in May (see figure below, source: Statista ). (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to recent rumors , Huawei will produce the next Nexus Android phone. (Uncertainty) </span>It's the first time that Google picked a Chinese manufacturer and indicates that Google also is focusing on the Chinese market.But Huawei phones are competing with Xiaomi, Lenovo and Android rather than Apple as people switch between Android phones more easily.Samsung is also rumored to be introducing the new Galaxy Note 5 in mid-August (from September) to get ahead of Apple before their introduction of iPhone 6S.This also is an indication that their new flagship Galaxy S6 has not been selling as expected.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The main risks for Apple going forward are high expectations after such a strong turnaround since loosing market share to Android before the bigger iPhones went on sale and a 40% growth in earnings. (Uncertainty) </span>Currently though expectations seem tampered and the media coverage last week was negative.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Sherri Scribner, senior tech analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, who last year downgraded Apple to Hold, said that "Apple was out of surprises and trading near all time high, making it more difficult to outperform expectations." (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now she says: "Apple has 40% growth this year and thus it will be hard to pick up growth next year and predicts that Apple will underperform next year" ("underperform" is the lowest grade and thus it can't be downgraded further by Deutsche Bank). (Uncertainty) </span>Analyst mean price target is $149.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Apple Watch seems to have reduced substantially in online sales from its introduction in the US (source: Slice ), but it's not known how it is doing in other parts of the world or in direct store sales in the US. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple initially didn't expect as much demand and the demand now is probably closer to their expectations. (Uncertainty) </span>The iPhone sold 1.5 million units in its first two quarters and 5.5 million the first year of sales.The impact on earnings is small as the margin on the watches is negative according to Tim Cook in the last earnings call ( Apple earnings call ).Apple has decided to return some of that cash they have been hoarding by buying back the shares and thus reducing the share float.In April they announced a $200 billion buyback through March 2017.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To estimate the effect on the future share price by assuming a constant market value ($730 billion diluted) the share buybacks are distributed evenly (shown in green in the figure below). (Uncertainty) </span>Then the share price would increase from $126 to $142, or 13% as shown with the black dashed line.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we assume a PE ratio of 15 and 13% increase from share buyback the share price might be $165 in the beginning of 2017. (Uncertainty) </span>The impact of the share buyback (calculated from Apple earnings releases ).The red columns show the decreasing shares and the green columns the cumulative share buyback (left axis).The black line shows the average share price and the dashed line the calculated share price increase due to the buyback if the market value would remain unchanged from the current price (right axis, USD).Net share settlement (new share rewards and options to employees) was only 3.6% of the cumulative total at March this year.The high increase in buyback should lower this ratio to less than 2% next year.This is quite low for Apple compared to many tech firms that lower expenses with stock issues to employees.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It's doubtful that the increasing market share trend will suddenly stop in China or that the world market share will hit a ceiling (i.e. 22% which is still much lower than Android) or that there will be no new markets to penetrate (i.e. India and Africa). (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The biggest threat to Apple's share price are high expectations and constant worries from analysts, but none of them is hardly expecting another year of such a spectacular growth and neither am I. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it's important for every investor looking at a stock receiving this much attention to know the risks and the negatives as there is less risk of exuberant expectations and prices to develop. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In light of the recent earning hikes from analysts, I wouldn't be surprised that after all Icahn would turn out to be correct and that earnings will be above $10 this fiscal year and $12 the next .
