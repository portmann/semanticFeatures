MSFT launches Surface Hub in two weeks I think Surface Hub is not only going to be a meaningful revenue segment for the company but a huge valueadd driver and retention vehicle MSFT should consider being highly promotional with productivity suite platforms like Project Power BI etc at Surface Hub launch to help both with take rate One fully immersed into the MSFT apps especially if deployed on the Surface Hub I believe customers will have a hard time exiting the ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is two weeks away from launching sales of its Surface Hub which I think has the potential to be a huge valueadd to its productivity suite take rate particularly Project Power BI Power BI Design and Visual Studio Everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has done as of late from restructuring management to continuing to drive key productivity integrations for its platforms has been in this effort to make its platforms the platforms of foundational choice <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would like nothing more than to see Power BI for instance become the Word for Business Intelligence a default program that users turn to without second thought The Surface Hub is all about making more visible the value of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ecosystem again the primary strategic initiative at the company currently Surface Hub will be an immediate collaboration and workflow valueadd and should become the central conference hardware for any institution that can afford one Its in this and how Surface Hub will be an ancillary capture funnel for the other applications that I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should seriously consider being highly promotional with app licensing to Surface Hub customers for a period of time immediately after purchase With a price tag of either or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>only needs to sell of its larger Surface Hub to create billion in revenues With most of the nonOffice suite apps Project Power BI etc having incremental subscription fees I think as a way to drive the value of both Surface Hub and the apps themselves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should give away months access to the productivity apps across the board for months with the purchase of a Surface Hub Of course not on an enterprise level but to a set number of subscriptions I think that with an ideal delivery platform for collaboration which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will also be making quite a bit of topline from that the benefits of immersing the customer in the total ecosystem hugely outweigh any nearterm reductions to subscription revenue I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should make a hard push to both establish its Surface Hub as a mission critical accretive piece of hardware while exampling the efficacy of its total productivity suite Again both can be done more effectively when used in tandem in this instance I would also think it beneficial to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>if on July st the company announces next iteration optimizations of all the platforms that are under its umbrella <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to launch Surface Hub with a bang and have everything as dialedin as possible If Surface Hub can gain traction not only will it become a new most likely low to midmargin revenue segment but it will become a retention vehicle from highmargin subscription revenue Im actually expecting a big positive reception for Surface Hub and think that it provides meaningful upside to numbers in the midterm Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface Hub Launch Is Important Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
