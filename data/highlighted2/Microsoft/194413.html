Seeking Alpha Many feel that the Havoc Engine is for internal game development I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has something much more aggressive in mind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT purchased the Havoc engine from Intel NASDAQ INTC For those not familiar Havoc is not an actual turning pistons kind of physical engine but rather the framework that numerous popular video games have been built on The Havoc engine is primarily focused on creating a realistic physics simulation inside of these games The other opinions Ive read so far focus on the benefits to Microsofts internal software development studios for the purposes of designing new games Im certain this will be a benefit but Im looking at this in a slightly different way An area where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has an exploitable weakness Windows is still the operating system of choice for almost of all PC users this includes the number of people who use Macs as well However there are many choices out there for the types of hardware that people can construct their computers from Motherboards RAM and graphics cards can be a nearly infinite number of combinations Since the introduction of Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has sought to bring simplicity to this jungle of manufacturers As has Intel The two companies have helped develop standards across the hardware industry that have streamlined the functions and cost of PCs Its still not perfect though When comparing performance many people have noted that game consoles especially Sonys NYSE SNE Playstation are capable of creating a very impressive experience in spite of using hardware that is several generations behind what is currently available as graphics hardware in the PC market The advantage is in the lower cost of building consoles over PCs for games Additionally games that were simultaneously developed for PC and PSXbox One have tended to have more glitches Time Warners NYSE TWX Batman Arkham Knight was a classic example of the problems that programmers have faced trying to optimize the game on what should have been easily more powerful hardware But even on cards that cost the game would stutter and crash during dramatic moments This happens because there are all those hardware possibilities with the PC market But with consoles every one of them has the exact same hardware in each box Software programmers can optimize the code that they are writing knowing that the outcomes will be uniform across the board and will not have as many problems with bugs They call this Writing to the metal internally The longer a console has been in the marketplace the better programmers become at making it more efficient <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>started to address this issue with DirectX a number of years ago They started helping D hardware manufacturers like Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and Radeon NASDAQ AMD create standards for what they were releasing As the years passed each of these companies was able to write closer and closer to the metal Where we stand today in graphics hardware has essentially come down to one remaining standard Physics Nvidia has its own proprietary physics engine called PhysX They bought the rights years ago and they have been using hardwareaccelerated physics since then The Radeon cards have no such component relying on most game designers to supply engines of their own It helps keep the cost of their cards down and lets them focus on geometry rendering instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will likely be seeking to integrate the Havoc engine into a future update of DirectX It would be for the purpose of optimizing the D performance on Windows hardware with less costly graphics cards likely the sub market I strongly believe that their end goal with this is to allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to sell set top computers with strong gaming performance At the beginning of the year I wrote an article titled Steam Machines A Serious Threat To Sony Microsofts Video Games Divisions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apparently knew this as well already Windows X is bringing functionality that combines the capabilities of the XBox One with PCs in general I think that they are trying to split the user base in the same way that Valve is trying to do with their Steam Machines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is going to market a new sort of XBox but thats not what it really is While the hardware inside may not be standard the performance will be and predictable This new set top box will be sideways compatible with Xbox One and older Xbox and classic Xbox games but will also be upgradeablescalable at the users discretion for an even more impressive experience People who want to save money can buy the Xbox One console Gamers who want to have the best experience possible will buy one of these new machines There is some additional evidence that supports this theory At E in July this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced backwards compatibility for the Xbox One but through software It allows the Xbox One to render older games created for the Xbox at higher frame rates and cleaner resolutions I believe that they intend to fully extend this capability to modern PC gamers as well The same computers that are being built as Steam Machines will also be able to play <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows games They always had that capability in fact but the Steam Machines use Valves proprietary operating systems to operate that hardware With a stronger physics engine in place players might be less motivated to use Valves SteamOS and just stick with the Windows that they already have That certainly helps make operating all of their other applications more convenient By adding this feature <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will allow more developers to write to the metal in a way they havent been able to previously Putting Havoc into the DirectX software will create a standard that will improve performance across the board You will be able to purchase a high end lets call them Xbox
