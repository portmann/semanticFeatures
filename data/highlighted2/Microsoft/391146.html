and its first revenue drop in years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market The companys sales dropped by more than a quarter in China its most important market after the United States and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues Its shares fell about percent dropping below for the first time since February A hike in Apples share buyback and dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors Apples results followed disappointing quarterly reports from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CorpMSFTO and Googleowner Alphabet Inc GOOGLO and microblog Twitter TWTRN also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations Apple said it sold million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter down from million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts estimates of about million devices While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise After years of blockbuster sales many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation spelling the end for Apples exponential growth Apple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth said Neil Saunders chief executive of research firm Conlumino Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter The iPhone is an anomaly he said But Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing reinforcing wider concerns of saturation Cook also conceded that the iPhone S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the I dont mean just a hair lower its a lot lower he said If wed had the same rate on S as it would be time for a huge party He pointed to the services division which includes Apple Music and the App Store as a bright spot Its revenue grew percent to billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales Cook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come The future of Apple is very bright he said Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store Earnings of per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of per share according to Thomson Reuters IBES Revenue of billion missed expectations of billion Apple forecast thirdquarter revenue of billion to billion short of the Wall Street consensus of billion Apple also said it was raising its capital return program by billion through a billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a percent rise in the quarterly dividend In March Apple released the iPhone SE a smaller inchscreen phone featuring much of the companys latest technology Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter the device is off to a strong start particularly in emerging markets Maestri said The situation right now around the world is that we are supplyconstrained he said The demand has been very very strong Although Apples revenue in Greater China fell percent from the yearago quarter Maestri stressed that the company was extremely optimistic about China We continue to make a lot of investment there he said Cook said that mainland China sales were down only percent in constant currency attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong where strength in the local dollar which is pegged to US currency deterred tourist shopping The company did not comment on prospects for its iBooks Stores and iTunes Movie service which were shut down last week in China The drop in afterhours shares wipes out roughly billion in market capitalization roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc CATN In
