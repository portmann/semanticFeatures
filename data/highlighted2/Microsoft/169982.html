Seeking Alpha MSFT EVP and CMO Chris Capossela presented at the Citi Global Technology Conference Capossela gave some very candid and very powerful commentary as to the nearterm strategic focuses of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and the overall direction of the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT EVP and Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela recently presented at the Citi Global Technology conference Capossela whos a growing more important figure at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>thanks in no small part to CEO Satya Nadellas strategic initiative to reshape the company image and messaging touched on several marquee areas of wonder in what was hosted as a very fireside chatlike presentation The following are my key takeaways We care about things like your what kind of browser are you using what is our share of our browser versus Googles browser versus Firefoxthats more queries being executed through Bing thats more ad revenues flowing through Edge and thats obviously the revenue source for us independent of the Windows device I should not say independent I should say post fail of the Windows device clearly shows another big oneso weve invested heavily in Cortana which is a personal digital assistant thats built into Windows and she can help you do all sorts of different things look up information remind you of things finds things for you And as you use Cortana you are not using the Bing or the Google query engine you were probably using minutes agoand the more people fall in love with Cortana and use Cortana the more were able to essentially capture that query share from Google This is a new product so I wouldnt have expected this to be a huge focus for the company prior but I was caught off guard when hearing Capossela stress the importance and the focus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will have on Edge going forward I actually think that Edge is a very nice Google Chrome NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL comp It might even be a slight improvement but my guess is it will take years of proving out its valueprop for Edge to take real market share from Chrome and I understand the investment in the browser by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but this is a bold initiative Chrome with it having over one billion users is the pound gorilla incumbent Trying to unseat Chrome wont be easy and it likely wont be cheap Regarding one possible spend item tethered to the unseating of Chrome Cortana might have been developed primarily with this endeavor in mind when assessing Cortanas capacity as a layover onto Edge I never would have thought about that prior to this conference It makes sense though thinking that Cortana is an Edgefirst developed tech in that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has no real competitive phone capacity where personal assistants are largely being deployed and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been hugely focused on winning the desktoptablet since Nadella took the head spot Im shocked by this Im intrigued But mostly Im just impressed The Nadella regime is going allin on winning the desktop and winning the productivity use case Expect this to be a huge narrative focus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>going forward PostWindows Device Fail A Return To Mobile Were also going to build phones for businesses We know business customers want a very very secure phone thats incredibly good at calendar management at email at productivity at Skype for business etc and so we think those two segments are segments we can focus on and build a much much better solution and much better business than we have todayI think we have too much to do in front of us right now to get back in the game with the two audiences that we think we can serve incredibly well and then well see how things evolve and well take it kind of one step at a time but obviously we want to be in the phone space Fresh off a huge impairment and off the multiyear embarrassment that was the mobile effort to hear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>eventually wants back in isnt surprising but it is somewhat surprising to hear that the company is making a clean break from the space This just isnt going to be a focus for the company and you know what Thats just fine if you ask me Im actually encouraged to hear the issue put to bed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should continue to do what Nadella has it doing focusing on winning what its good at Sticking to hitting the ball down the middle of the fairway and hitting the short lay up onto the green rather than trying to hit onto the green with one shot What I also took from this dense passage was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and the company has evidenced this with its recent partnering and deep integration with Box NYSE BOX this greatly values security Box with its EKM and governance product rollouts is the leader in the cloud collaboration and cloud storage niche Box also happens to be getting cheaper by the day Of everything outlined by Caposella the only thing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt provide per se is the securing of everything via its cloud lets not have the OneDrive discussion here because Box simply does it better And how convenient would it be to just add that service as a layover via MA Ive opined this makes a bunch of sense before but hearing Caposella lead with security isnt something that isnt productive to my BoxMicrosoft MA thesis Right now by all indications it appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is content to simply lean into Boxs services but my guess continues to be that if Box gets cheap enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would step in and take it out Ill be closely watching Microsofts MA efforts from a rollup standpoint much smaller MA to see if they leave any breadcrumbs for what could be a bigger push so you know we have Skype the consumer Skype business which essentially is a free model and then we monetize on the enterprise side with Skype for Business and there youre essentially paying for all the IP value that consumers really dont care about but then enterprises care a lot about So that might be quality of service that might be audit ability log ability discovery obviously security those types of things When you think about the Skype for Business category you are really talking about corporate instant messaging audio conferencing video conferencing remote meetings realtime collaboration Its all of those spaces sort of blended into one tool setand so for us there is just a huge opportunity for an IPbased solution that a company can use with their existing hardwarethey are only to bring in new devices as literally laptops tablets phones that can run all of this tech and yet they can make their employees far far more productive than they are today and frankly unplug a lot of the legacy infrastructure that they have I mean I think we all still have that experience of starting a conference call and taking a long time for everybody to get going We think it takes about to minutes to get one of these meetings sort of up and running which is just pathetic particularly when you add a third party and when it is not someone working just in your company and so it is just a lot of upside to making that experience reinventing that and making it far far better and thats how we think of it Ok I know thats a big passage but I think all of it is important I also think being a realist about what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is trying to do here matters as well Ill try to break this out while now waving the pompoms First I find it incredibly refreshing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is taking on big challenges This is a big one the remote corporate meeting problem But its also highly competitive Plenty of capable wellmarketed public and private competitors also are trying to capture this market and some are doing a fairly decent job of this That said nobody is executing on a level where it wouldnt make sense to at least hear a pitch from somebody else <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>took on Skype with big eyes and high ambition but no real deployment use case that made sense in its at the time Frankensteins Monster of a product portfolio and company model Now with its focus on productivity and on securing enterprise business how smart does that Skype purchase look How perfectly does Skype with its nearopen architecture for usage fit into the total productivity suite for SMBenterprises We now have the greater Office productivity suite we have the ancillary additives like Power BI and Desktop and finally we have specific usecase additions like Skype <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>if it can drive adoption of Skype or provide some ecosystem benefit for using Skype has a closed loop productivity ecosystem that is all inclusive That matters It really matters to huge enterprises that want one singular provider of technology and enterprise solutions It also really matters to that midrange SMB market thats growing quickly and not simply selecting a productivity provider based on the now but on the who is big enough to service us when were double this size in months Thats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can find a marquee item outside of its Office productivity suite something thats the final yeah but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also does this for me item I just think that its SMBenterprise pack is going to be really really hard to pass up Thats viewing the suite and the ecosystem asis in realtime Thats not giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>any credit for integrating Cortana into Skype or to Dynamics or to anything Thats as of right now and right now only My guess is that Cortana wasnt developed and wasnt invested in to only be deployed at minimal scale So just factor that into any personal assessments I think Skype is going to be a major major mover for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the immediate term Im also going to be watching Microsofts roll up acquisitions for anything that hints at helping along SkypeCortana integration or SkypeCortana use case expansion I continue to really like the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I think that the company is doing all the right things and saying all the right things to rebuild market confidence that was lost the greater part of the last five years That doesnt mean <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will execute or imply that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will see any level of success but boy is it a start I think the next months at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are going to be incredibly important in determining the companys place in broader tech and its longterm viability While this was just one conference I really like what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has going on right now I continue to recommend a long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Good luck everybody Disclosure Iwe have no
