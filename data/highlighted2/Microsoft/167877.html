alternative hardware to maintain growth A key selling point for the new TV will rely on AAPLs app store According to the media outlets Apples NASDAQ AAPL new TV will feature improved hardware a dedicated app store and wireless controller that could potentially challenge the existing game consoles dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Sony NYSE SNE Additionally AAPL also will integrate Siri into Apple TV to deliver voice interaction to the consumer living rooms I see two key implications for upgrading the Apple TV product First iPhones innovation curve is flattening and this was reflected by the deceleration in handset upgrades across major wireless carriers With the iPad seeing declining sales and the Apple Watch failing to gain meaningful traction among consumers AAPL is looking to enhance another hardware category to strengthen its ecosystem and also offset the weakness in iPhone growth Second the improved Apple TV is designed to drive higher app store and media content sales which are potentially a bigger part of AAPLs longterm story Although Im bearish on AAPL due to its flattening of the innovation curve on the iPhone due to its diminishing ecosystem from slower handset salesupgrade and the competitive threat from Asian OEMs such as Xiaomi and Huawei Im more positive on the growth of the app store given its higher than average margin profile and growth rate However given the smaller revenue contribution of apps and Apple TV to AAPLs overall revenue I continue to remain cautious on AAPL as I do not expect the next iPhone model to be a game changer In my view AAPLs decision to rekindle its TV product is a clear sign that the company is acknowledging that the iPhone innovation curve is plateauing Worth noting despite the changes made to the iPhone in terms of display processing power memory exterior designs camera and voice assistance lowcost rivals from China such as Xiaomi OPPO Huawei Lenovo and OnePlus have created devices that easily match AAPLs flagship device In some cases the Chinese OEM can even deliver innovative features to the market ahead of AAPL The best example of this would be the recent introduction of touch force display by Huawei for its Mate S handset at the IFA event Huaweis pressure sensing device is similar to that of AAPLs soontolaunch force touch display which detects pressure on the display to deliver a completely new set of interaction with the apps and the device One of the authors friends got the opportunity to test the Mate S and came away impressed at both the feature and the handset and even is considering purchasing a Huawei after the contract expires in her iPhone Huaweis firsttomarket on the force touch display is not a special case but a part of a bigger trend as smaller Chinese OEMs abridge their hardware gap with AAPL Another friend of mine who works at Huawei HiSilicon the chip division once said that whatever AAPL can make they can make it better and beat AAPL to the market This view is actually shared by many Chinese smartphone companies as they gradually migrate their handset from lowend to the midhighend to compete directly against AAPL Competitive risk is clearly increasing and its critical for AAPL to promote another hardware device to offset the oneproduct risk that it has with the iPhone Apple TV could be the answer as the TV market globally is less disrupted with many OEMs producing similar settop boxes and TV sets similar to the preiPhone era with many mobile handset makers This provides a favorable backdrop for AAPL to create an innovative device that can compete against the existing players A key selling point of the Apple TV will be the number of apps and content The new TV device will drive a new line of apps and this will be a positive for game publishers such as Activision NASDAQ ATVI EA Games NASDAQ EA and TakeTwo NASDAQ TTWO These prospects are widely documented but investors should not expect hardcore games to embrace the product as the new device will still lag that of existing consoles in terms of graphics and processing power That said investors should not expect meaningful share gain in the near term but improvements in hardware specs cloud technology and the potential entry into the VR race could give AAPL a chance to expand into hardcore games In conclusion I remain bearish on AAPL which is essentially a oneproduct company and I do not see how sustainable AAPLs ecosystem will be due to decelerating product sales that in turn limit the growth potential of the ecosystem
