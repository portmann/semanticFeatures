Microsofts execution strategy and tone have changed for the better MSFT has some great new products on the market Years ago I read some good advice which suggested that investors should wait at least six months if not longer before buying stock in a turnaround story The rationale is that it will take at least six months to determine if changes are starting to generate positive results or gaining any traction You may have to pay a higher price for waiting but it reduces the downside from the companies that are not making progress By following this advice I have been able to avoid many poor choices and at the same time taken advantage of some good opportunities that still had a long runway With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT I ended up waiting over a year before finally feeling comfortable enough to pull the trigger Below are some of the reasons why Im excited for Microsofts future Under Steve Ballmers reign Microsofts execution was hit or miss We tend to remember the misses but there were some successes as well However since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in February the execution appears to have improved Also Mr Ballmer was criticized for the companys strategy which Mr Nadella has changed substantially Another change is on its way as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is updating its financial reporting again to better reflect the companys strategy and ambitions It will now have three reporting segments Productivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing Up to this point I have been very pleased with the moves that Mr Nadella has made and believe the Board of Directors made the correct choice in hiring him I dont expect everything that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does to be a success but I do expect that future execution and strategy will be better than the past The tone at MSFT has changed substantially which has allowed the strategy to change <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is becoming much more open and willing to provide products and services across competitor platforms This is an important change Also it is unusual for a company to not only willingly bring an activist on board but to also encourage the activist to be a spokesman However that is exactly what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has done If you havent seen it already here is a video with ValueAct Capitals Mason Morfit published on Microsofts website I am very excited about Office and the subscription model Currently I am writing this article on Word Why Because I am value minded cheap and had an old disk lying around which I used to download it free on my computer That is the problem with the old model as a person can buy an Office product once download it on their computer and not have to pay again until the computer dies With the new subscription model you pay less up front but pay more over time as each customer is charged subscription fees on a regular basis Initially this will reduce revenue and earnings but over the long term it should increase both This creates a more stable revenue stream as well At my last job I used Office and thought the product allowed me to be more efficient With that argument it may be worth getting rid of my free Office for the improved efficiency I was seeing with Office Within days of Windows being on the market I was able to download it onto two computers It is far superior to Windows in my opinion I have not had nearly as many issues with Windows as Windows and I like the look and feel of it Also I appreciate that it will be continuously updated The strategy to allow free upgrades for all Windows Windows and Windows Phone was a great move Already million users have switched to Windows which means it is about of the way to its goal In the near term the free upgrade strategy will reduce revenues but will increase usage Along with Windows I downloaded the new Edge browser It is an upgrade from Internet Explorer and has some cool features but there are some websites that I still have issues with when using Edge That being said over time I expect these issues to be resolved Windows and Edge provide more evidence of Microsofts improving execution and strategy MSFT still needs to improve its execution on many of its hardware products but the new Surface Book is a good start As Wired stated Microsofts Surface Book is the most exciting Windows laptop in years If I wasnt so valueoriented I would probably think about buying one myself but its a little too pricey for me The ability to detach the screen and the flexible hinge are useful but performance is key <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>claims its the fastest laptop of its size ever made This shows that the company may be able to put out products that really excite people It also may encourage other computer OEMs to improve their designs which should benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as well The Surface tablets also appear to be good products and HoloLens has some potential and interesting capabilities We will see if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can continue to push ahead and make more cool devices Compared to the prioryear quarter Dynamics revenue grew in constant currency and Dynamics CRMs online base grew by almost x in Q Furthermore commercial cloud revenue was up in constant currency This bodes very well for the new Productivity and Business Processes segment which includes Office Office Dynamics and Dynamics Online Also last quarter server products and services grew at in constant currency which is a good sign for the Intelligent Cloud segment Search revenue grew with Bing increasing market share by to Combine this with the new Surface Book and maybe it can offset a little bit of the decline in Windows OEM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a bright future ahead in my opinion I expect better execution strategy and products The subscription service should add value and there is strong growth in many areas of the company We only
