not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article VentureBeat has reported that Apple is considering Intel for a modem and possibly foundry services for the next iPhone Selection of an Intel modem is unlikely given that a superior modem from Qualcomm will be available Use of Intel foundry services is also unlikely for a variety of reasons Most importantly tests of the iPhone s demonstrate that its processor is far superior to any x processor Intel could offer Recently VentureBeat reported that Intel NASDAQ INTC has people working on chips for the iPhone which is a repackaged speculation VentureBeat had published back in March While the reports may appeal to Intels investors it probably doesnt make sense in the context of the paradigm shift in semiconductor manufacturing that Apple NASDAQ AAPL represents I continue to find signs in technology articles and article comments of a certain nostalgia that semiconductor investors have for the commodity semiconductor paradigm In this paradigm companies such as Intel supplied chips for a host of OEMs who duked it out with other OEMs To the semiconductor supplier it didnt matter which OEM became dominant The semiconductor supplier was in a sense at the top of the food chain Articles such as those that appeared in VentureBeat play on the longing for a return to those good ol days The fantasy scenario that is proffered is that once Intel has its foot in the door with a modem for the iPhone then Apple would turn to Intel for foundry services for an SOC that integrates the Intel modem Finally there is the implication that eventually Apple will give up this silly notion that it can design its own SOCs and turn to Intel Architecture since its obviously superior So in the fantasy scenario we come full circle to the commodity processor supplierOEM device maker paradigm of the PC days Then all will be right with the world There are so many things wrong with this scenario that its only by appealing to a very deep seated bias on the part of Intel investors that such articles can even find an audience And clearly the leaked information being reported in the VentureBeat articles has to be coming from the Intel side Even this says a great deal about the substance of the rumors If Intel had anything like a commitment from Apple there would be no leaks Intel is professional enough to respect Apples product secrecy requirements if there were any No this is Intel deliberately leaking information in the hopes it will get some buzz and contribute to a groundswell of interest that might sway Apple Im sure its true as far as it goes Im sure there are many Intel engineers working on the LTE modem Im sure Apple has been invited to presentations where Intel pitches the modem Im sure there is some level of interchange between the two companies where Apple engineers have communicated requirements for a future iPhone In particular Im sure its true that Apple has not committed to the Intel modem Why should Apple commit to the Intel modem It has better modem waiting in the wings in the form of the Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM X modem that Qualcomm will incorporate into the Snapdragon and which will also be available as the MDM Apple currently uses the MDMM in the new iPhone s By virtually every standard the Qualcomm X modem will be superior to what Intel is promising for the For instance the X will feature a maximum download rate of Mbitsec versus the rate of Mbitsec Qualcomm by virtue of the prior experience of Apple engineers with Qualcomm modems enjoys a tremendous incumbency advantage over Intel Given that Qualcomm will offer better performance than Intel I dont see why Apple would be motivated to switch One scenario has it that Apple will choose the Intel modem on the basis of its assumed lower cost for an iPhone targeted at emerging markets When has Apple shown any willingness to lower the quality of its phones to move down market What of the supposed link to Infineon where the modem technology of Intel came from that exists inside of Apple When Intel bought the German company Apple took the opportunity as the VentureBeat article points out to scoop up numerous Infineon executives and engineers who were jumping ship rather than work for Intel Clearly they have no particular allegiance or love for Intel The hiring of the Infineon personnel is an important clue to Apples longterm objectives Apple as the SOC integrator for its mobile devices needs to be able to include modems into the SOC This is clearly where the industry led by Qualcomm is moving This will reduce the overall chipset cost inside Apple devices as well as give it better control over the modem in terms of power management Until that objective is achieved the Infineon personnel can certainly serve as liaison with Intel but Im sure they do with Qualcomm as well The VentureBeat article also supports Apple wanting to move the modem onto the SOC However the article assumes that this would be a modem design licensed from Intel and that Intel would get foundry business from Apple by fabricating the resultant SOC The key problem with this scenario is that Intel executives have already made it clear on numerous occasions that Intels foundry services are not open to processors that would directly compete with Intel Architecture chips Since Intel is currently competing in both smartphones and tablets Apples SOCs would certainly qualify for the ban I believe that this is the best explanation for why Apple isnt already using Intel as a foundry but its not the only one Suppose Intel relaxed the ban Theres still the problem of Intel as a competitor who has waged a campaign of predatory pricing in the form of the contra revenue scheme of its tablet and possibly phone processors to gain market share That has to lead to some bad blood between the companies given that declining sales of iPad that have coincided with contra revenue since the beginning of Even if Apple overlooks this Apple has already been there and done that with using a competitors foundry service As I have pointed out Apple is motivated to transition away from Samsung OTCSSNLF partly because it cant really be certain that its trade secrets will not be leaked from the foundry service to Samsungs mobile device business This would certainly be a consideration for any foundry arrangement with Intel Given Apples need for security Apple relying on TSMC NYSE TSM as a foundry partner makes more sense Apple doesnt have to worry about TSMC trying to get into the device business TSMCs process may not be the equal of Intels but it makes more sense for Apple to fund TSMCs move to nm from the current nm process as rapidly as possible Given Intels slowdown of introduction of nm to late Apple has a good chance of getting to nm faster with TSMC which has stated that it will start nm production in Another possible interpretation of the foundry issue is that Apple adopts Intel Architecture CPU cores in its SOCs I still encounter articles and comments that assume that Intel Architecture would be superior but in fact with the A processor in the new iPhone s Intel is only falling further behind This point was made clear to me by the excellent and very comprehensive review of the iPhone s that just came out in Anandtech The review confirms my longheld belief that iPhone s is the worlds fastest smartphone Intels Atom X SoFIA smartphone SOC is so far behind the A that its not even worth the trouble to compare the two And it might not even be fair since the X is still fabricated on a nm process for cost reasons So lets do a comparison that makes more sense in terms of indicating future Intel smartphone capability Lets compare the A to the Intel Atom X which is actually a tablet processor but it probably shows where Intel could be in smartphone SOCs in about a year or two The X is fabricated on Intels best nm process so its not disadvantaged the way the X is In the table below I compare test results administered by Anandtech for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface running Win bit and the iPhone s of the just completed review The test results were given in two separate articles and Ive compiled only the benchmarks that were in common Here Ive normalized the performance results to the iPhone s and included the iPhone for comparison In almost all the tests the iPhone s is clearly superior You could argue that to some degree the poor performance is the fault of Windows and I cant disprove this Clearly a processor comparison would be better done with identical operating systems But even Anandtechs tests often compare iOS and Android devices so cross OS comparisons are normal My own experience says that Win is not that bad In fact it showed considerable performance improvement compared to Win I personally doubt that its the underlying cause of the performance shortfall I think the results demonstrate that with the A processor Apple has moved way ahead of Intel Architecture for low power devices Apple makes performance improvements with each new generation A series SOC so the A in the iPhone will be even better In all three of the categories Ive discussed Intel falls short Intel doesnt offer the better modem Qualcomm does Intel doesnt offer the more desirable foundry service all things considered TSMC does And Intel doesnt offer the better processor architecture Apple does I continually urge investors to be datadriven in their decision making The VentureBeat article is not a datadriven approach its a prejudicedriven approach that simply assumes that Intel inside would be a good thing At most theres a possibility that Intel might get a modem into iPhone but even this seems very dubious As for foundry services I think Apple is quite happy with TSMC And as for Intel Architecture despite claims to the contrary its just falling further behind Despite the fond wish of Intel investors there is no going back from the paradigm shift that is making oldstyle semiconductor companies like Intel obsolete </div></body></html>
