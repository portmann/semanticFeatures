from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site On Wednesday of this past week Apple held its muchanticipated annual rollout of new products and features to the Apple lineup However this latest presentation caused more head scratching as well as out right consternation than any in recent memory There was one other but Ill get to that later when theres more context as to compare Whether it be within the confines of media reviews or tech blogs it seems almost to a person the reaction to this latest event was anything but celebratory Rather the overarching theme revolved around the questioning of Did they just witness the initial confirmation that many have pondered now these last few years ie Has Apple lost or is rapidly losing their soulspirit of innovation Or just the outright feeling of confirmation without Jobs Apple is an also ran Like many I too was flummoxed when watching the event However unlike some I saw things a little differently What I saw and the way I saw it Ill illustrate as well as counter how I believe many of the obvious missteps as well as outright blunders were made should have been handled and addressed differently Although Im going to address my assertions through my business eye for thats what I do professionally as if I were called into the board of Apple in a hypothetical sense and asked my opinion I want to make sure its known for the record I could be what one considers an Apple fan boy I use their products near exclusively and have great respect for the company Yet much like if I saw a family member doing the obvious wrong things being openly harsh critical or straight forward in that criticism doesnt mean any lack of respect Quite the contrary So first things first For the first time since the inception of these stylized Event rollouts one thing was clear to almost everyone that viewed it The presentation along with its cinematic star quality infused theatrics more often than not didnt help nor bolster the products or presenters Again for the first time that I can remember it actually seemed to take it away A few things were obvious One of these is the incessant use of the glorious styled verbiage made famous by Apple when trying to invoke awe inspired anticipation The problem this time were the products they were introducing There were obvious trip wires that needed to be addressed that one could see for miles Yet it seemed as if Apple was going to pay no attention to them and roll them out because Theyre Apple therefore youre going love it The Apple Watch fits into this category probably more than any other The problem It seems the push is to present the watch as a fully formed device which it clearly is not Yes there is the nod that more and more applications are forthcoming However it is quite obvious the main focus is all too centered on fit and finish The push about what band one can now choose and the on and on aspect of the details of these bands subliminally pushes one to assume I guess thats all they have to show right now I believe the watch will be a great product in the future And its easy to understand its a work in progress that needs to be out in the public a little before prime time as to see just where the market wants to take it And theres nothing wrong with that That said the more that Apple makes this almost sycophantic push towards fit and finish currently It doesnt hide or subvert its obvious current limitations it pushes them more into the fore front If you wanted more proof of the Were Apple therefore youre going to love it attitude that I believe allowed for the lack of selfawareness to see obvious issues or miscues All one had to do was watch the introduction of the Apple Pencil It went something like this Ladies and gentlemen May I draw youre attention to the big screen behind me and behold Never before in the history of mankind has such a device ever been thought of by mere mortal man Ladies and gentlemen I introduce to you the pencil And there on the screen stood what at first blush was a representation of the one thing Jobs railed against a stylus You could hear either a collective chuckle or YAYYYYyyyyywait a what The set up for this product buzzkilled its own introduction Another was when the new IPad Pro was revealed to show it with its newly designed specific keyboard What seemed at first like thunderous applause drifted quickly to be silenced by the obvious kneejerked gasp when the big screen showed what everyone instinctively recognized as a product resembling what no one seems to use or want a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface These werent the only missteps just the most obvious A few others Well there was the lets show you just what you can do on this fantastic great super stupendous mind altering supercalafragilous new product Well start by bringing on our next guest speakers from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Even the crowd within the center went speechless It was a clear awkward moment Again all selfinflicted Think about it Within the span of a few minutes a new product was introduced that for all intents and purposes can really be a game changer with applications for both personal as well as enterprise use never before available to Apple And within the course of those minutes did nothing but leave the impression this great new product has a stylus and a keyboard configuration that looks all to close to a Surface and cemented that impression with introducing none other than a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>representative to demonstrate how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office will run on it Again think about that And as bad as that progression was it was enhanced And not for the better in my view The next guest or representative in the line up Adobe You know that company which right before Jobs passed was still calling them out for shipping lousy software One silently wondered if Pages or Keynote were going to still run on Apple products because other than what seemed as a hat tip to Garageband one was left feeling unclear And remember this is Apples premier event The missteps as to the attention to detail of presentation flow was nothing less than stunning I personally can not remember such outright blunders in previous rollouts And I was not alone for what I heard from others who just wanted to see what was new reacted in ways I previously never encountered Here was my first confirmation that it wasnt just me All the above overshadowed what has been the usual star of these events The iPhone Nobody that I talked to could even remember what new innovation or updates were made to the newest version All they seemed to remember was theres now an S version but other than that it was all about What is up with that new iPad Or A stylus Are you kidding me A freaking stylus WTF is up with that And that seemed to be the cumulative summation I distilled from both my personal exchanges as well as what Ive seen in both tenor and tone reported almost everywhere This is and should be taken by Apple as a clear warning sign this bruised Event could be the one that spoils the whole bunch going forward The event showed to my eyes in stunning clarity that Apple delivered this presentation via the viewpoint and execution of Were Apple and youre gonna love our new products and upgrades because were Apple and were saying so because were Apple Again whether intentional or not Too my eyes it was a clear illustration of Rarefied air has become breathing ones exhaust fumes Now heres where I take a different tack from everyone else Personally I believe the upgrades as well as new products are noteworthy Its all about the delivery as well as introduction I take issue with And this area of difficulty is a first for Apple How they mange their way around as well as through this obvious debacle will be one of Apples greatest challenges post Steve Jobs in my view For perception is just as big as product to no other company as it is to Apple So thats my descriptive view Now lets delve into the prescriptive Right off the start lets address the greatest of overhangs that is not nor will not go away unless Apple itself stops trying to push it themselves Tim Cook is not nor will he ever be seen in the same light as Jobs Period end of story Not by anyone at Apple itself nor the public at large So stop trying Again period Its hurting Apples as well as Mr Cooks image more than its helping So again stop Please for the love of humanity just stop Although I dont know Mr Cook personally Im sure hes a great guy and we know hes a competent executive for he has done some great things since Jobs passing in helping to lead and maintain Apples core structure We also know Jobs had great admiration for his executive qualities However no one can replace Jobs And the more one tries or desperately hangs on to the idea to replace rather than move forward is in effect moving backwards This is why the more one tries the worse the comparisons fester And Apple seems to be trying far far too hard in this one area alone Let me use an analogy based in music as opposed to strictly business Van Halen didnt replace David Lee Roth with Sammy Hagar Sammy Hagar nor the band tried to be Van Halen with Sammy acting as a stand in replacement for Roth Same can be said with ACDC Just like with first example after Bon Scott there truly was no replacement So they didnt They added Brian Johnson and the rest is history Whether you liked or disliked the new band was exactly the point Van Halen as well ACDC were a new band and they werent afraid of the comparisons They took them straight on and made no bones about it This allowed the band to be its own force while still paying reverence to previous milestones without any regards to What would David or Bon do Apple needs to apply the same or theyll never get out from under What would Jobs do Ill use as proof for my assertions using a current screenshot I took from Apples own public webpage Photo Credit Screenshot taken of Apples public home page Why my criticism First of all It has nothing to do with Mr Cook personally The issue is it shows or implies just how tonedeaf blind or nervous Apple is becoming Apple seems to be bordering on desperate as to be trying to create a replacement figure and its now far too striking as to evade the inserting for subliminal comparison whether intended or not of Cook as Jobs And far too many have an instinctive gut reaction too it And its not in the affirmative Jobs was and always will be the comparison to these events as well as the face of Apple Now and for the foreseeable future If the solitary person in this type photo is not Jobs it should only be the closest thing possible to him and its not a person its the product or the logo Anything or anyone else stands right out as trying too hard in pushing a narrative Since the passing of Jobs no person for the immediate future will meet the mark The only one that can is the productproducts themselves Anything less hurts the image as well as brand of everyone involved by my calculations I believe unlike many and Ill wager its the Board itself that is the most confused on this subject the more Mr Cook removes himself as the face of Apple and puts forth the product as the face the more Jobslike Apple remains in the public eye as well as the lessening of many of the unfair comparisons Cook as well as Apple has to constantly dodge or defend against This is where Apple is being its own worst enemy They desperately need as well as want to move out from under the Jobs comparisons as time and products march on Yet it seems Apple itself is the one unwittingly making that trek all the more harder Then there were the introductions of new or improved products Here there were far more miscues as well as missteps than I can remember So Ill take just the ones that are in my frontofmind First there were the transitions from introduction to video presentation In a word for someone who understands the importance of theater and seamless transitions They were horrible Apple once excelled at these until recently At this event They were clumsy allowing for misconceptions to fester No not in the content and production value of the videos themselves It was in the handoff from presenter to video They simply just didnt flow There was no better example of this than when the Apple Pencil video was shown Personally I cringed The videos introduction did not match the content The content was great but you were trying to get over the idea that this was not a stylus first And it felt that way For anyone paying attention this was an obvious flaw And it was obvious the ones who should have been paying attention ie Apple were not or could not see it The attention to details such as this was always prominent and seemed to never be lost on Jobs However at this event it was conspicuously not there And while were on it lets talk about the Pencil Not only was the rollout worse than bad It actually may have set back the whole adoption cycle months if not years just based in ridicule For nearly everyone remembers one of Jobs strongest arguments against anything was the need for a stylus And the way the introduction of the Pencil was presented did nothing to alleviate that memory In fact it brought it out frontandcenter Its a shame because the Pencil truly is so much more but again the presentation did little to change that initial perception It would not have been hard to take this issue head on and maybe have some fun with it Make it their own postJobs product launch he would be proud of It could have easily been done in my view if the obvious hurdles would have been addressed right from the get go rather than trying to act as if no one would remember the past The diametric forces of aweinspiring and ridicule enforcing left it up to the product itself to overcome them A tough task when everything is running perfectly Quite another when its happening within obvious missteps or miscues An easy way to have overcome many of the obvious would have been to remind people of a few things like When Steve was around one thing he was not afraid to do was to change his mind if one could prove that he should which he did many times but you had to prove it first to convince him not just express or think that he should Steve would tell anyone who asked As soon as you need a stylus you lose and we still believe he is right Thats why we dont and wont make one So today I introduce to you a technological instrument so advanced we gave it the only name that could match it for context simplicity and ease of use Ladies and gentlemen I introduce to you today the Apple Pencil It took me no longer to think of the above than to type it Its not perfect but its far better from what was presented ie act like no ones first reaction will be Its a stylus Again this is a detail I believe would have never been allowed circa Jobs It was far too obvious for initial reactionary ridicule Yet thats exactly how it went off Then there was the other obvious calamity The gut reaction to the iPad Pro with its new smart cover keyboard Again here we saw Apple acting as if it there was no such thing as the Surface It was breathtakingly tonedeaf for what would be the obvious reaction You almost could feel the collective gasps worldwide through your monitors Again I personally was stunned on such a misstep My argument is this all could have been so easily addressed and possibly as Ive stated again and again been a turning point in the post Jobs era And in a good way If the new IPad had been presented differently showing its new size and features for general use as associated with the current versions only They did some of this but it was far too little What they should have done was introduce and infuse with a little more depth some of the new features and reasoning why a physical keyboard will be necessary for upcoming partnerships with new collaborative partners such as those announced with IBM and highlight it with more detail People get that Say things like As game changing as the iPad was to the home and business weve discovered there more possibilities than ever and these possibilities demand two new features unparalleled by any other brand today First with our larger screen size new enterprise functions and uses are now available that were not conducive to previous iPads Although the bigger screen allows for a more natural feeling keyboard we know by listening to all of our customers they want an Apple designed and built dedicated IPad removable keyboard Im here to tell you we heard you and we listened And so I introduce to you today what at first may look like another brands however I respectfully say It is anything but and heres why Instead the keyboard attached version went up on the big screen and did nothing but put frontofmind what the heck is that A Surface Thats the new thing The following dissertation felt like Apple believed customers had never seen a similar product No matter how well crafted and design specific for IPad this new keyboard is The timing and delivery for its introduction like the Pencil was a self inflicting buzzkill for it I say again this all was so blatantly selfinflicted it was painful to watch from my view One place that has yet to lose its luster or fall into the lame are the informative product videos showcasing Jony Ive Here is where the Apple of yesterday still shows through today Even though Ive is not shown there is gravitas in voice and reputation for we all instinctively understand many of these products are associated with his creative vision much like Jobs However these unlike the Event shake free of the postJobs gravitational pull Why The product is the feature not a person Its not lost on anyone that Ive is still responsible for the products creative attributes But it does one thing that Apple Inc itself has not yet learned It allows Ive and the product to stand on their own in a postJobs world of Apple And I believe not only are these displaying a tenor and tone Jobs would approve of I believe they are showing the way Apple itself needs to start addressing this issue far more head on than seemingly trying to either avoid it or push a persona in the fear of they dont know of any other way That way is right under their own noses yet they seem somehow patently blind to the obvious Apple isnt about Jobs anymore Hes gone and hes not coming back And the more Apple tries to fill that void the deeper and wider the chasm becomes to fill by their own hand Apple is no longer about a person its about the product And the product is the only thing capable of bridging that gap or hole left with the passing of Jobs And the sooner Apple realizes it and takes that to heart The faster and better both Apple their products as well as the management and employees will be Where they can all get back to doing what Jobs would be the most concerned with as well as probably proud of ie Running a great company steered by smart people creating insanely great and revolutionary products second to none And as for that only other Event I mentioned at the beginning I could think of none other than the one that caused an even more visceral knee jerk reaction than the one hosted by Jobs himself That event One of the first where he introduced none other than Bill Gates on the big screen as a new partnership between the two rivals Again Jobs could have easily tried to hide the fact or never speak about the collaboration he made with Gates at the time There possibly was no worse time than then to even discuss such a possibility never mind an already done deal Yet Jobs did just that Jobs instinctively knew you cant hide the pound gorilla or act like its not there You have to get past it one way or the other come hell or highwater And they did just that Again the lesson for Apple today is right there in the Apple of yesterday All they have to do is look For the only thing in my opinion holding Apple back from moving forward and beyond is Apple itself Sun Chuck Knoblauch Unfortunately it will remain classified as a national security secret Sun

than a sub shop plus their spokesman is not a pedo like Jared trabesman Fogel Sun jnx Zero innovation there now The first thing that Cook did after taking the helm is use his position to come out of the closet I was like who gives a shit who you like to screw What about the products and the innovation That guy is a lost cause All my coworkers sitting around watching that circle jerk last week for hours while I rebuilt servers was annoying the shit out of me I felt like telling them all to get back to work and stop wasting time Downloading music fom the internet onto mobile devices Putting a

Sony kept the Betamax technology to themselves Sun Pure Evil Apple might have had more market penetration if they hadnt projected an air of superiority about their earlier products Man Can you imagine how much that jar would be worth on Ebay if you let it ferment for a decade Despite all he wrote the fact is Apples biggest threat to it isnt lack of innovation and all that it entails but BANKERS Bankers are destroying the middle class and soon Apple is going to find it ever more difficult to sell anything to anyone at any price Ive always wondered why the captains of industry havent gotten together to fight the banksters The banksters are a collective threat to everyone Sun Catullus The part that was shear asshole from Apple was that the Apple TV was released at different price points for gb and gb when its the size of a mini desktop mini is pushing it now Fuck that noise You can get a mini desktop for the same with gb of RAM over a TB of space And they previewed no home automation with it If you buy that new Apple TV youre an asshole Buy an HP mini desktop with Linux on it Sun Spiritof IMO without Jobs Apple has enough product line inertia to stay profitable for a long time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>since Gates has gotten just as bureaucratic The rapid change in improvements couldnt keep that pace forever Sun buzzsaw they might as well join

stylus It is clearly a nonJobs Apple so one of major arguments of the article is a doozy It is clear that Surface is a superior product to iPad so their nervousness is understandable I personally have dropped Apple from my shopping lists ever since I had to pay to get the same obsolete and year old graphics card on my iMac plus their refusal to service Mac Air keyboard due to water damage few keys
