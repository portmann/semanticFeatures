notebooks The new Dell Venue Pro is more attractive than the iPad Pro Dell which previously signed up to selldistribute <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Surface tabletnotebook products announced that it is coming up with a new line of Windows Venue tabletnotebook products The new Venue Pro Series is a enterprisecentric tablet that uses Intels NASDAQ INTC latest nm Atom xZ SoC Dell is obviously positioning this one as a cheaper alternative to the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPad Pro and Surface Pro While it has agreed to sell the highend Surface Pro to its corporate customers Dell is not abandoning its Venue tablet business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>already offers the budgetfriendly Surface for However Dell is likely intent on selling its own Windows tablet so it could sign up more customers for its commercial enterprise software products like Client Command Suite While Dell will get a commission for every Surface Pro it sells the potential income from selling its own hardware plus the sales from its software is too important to ignore I opine that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is unlikely to package Dells commercial enterprise software inside its own Surface Pro Whatever the reason is for Dells decision to not go exclusive on Surface Pro Intel still benefits from this major OEMs continuing loyalty The enterprise campaign of the iPad Pro is now facing another hurdle Aside from the Surface Pro the iPad Pro now has a potent rival in the much affordable Dell Venue Pro The tray price of the Atom xZ belies its decent computing power Its an advanced bit processor that touts W of Scenario Design Power SDP of energy efficiency and yet it can still run any x industrystandard or custom software This is something that the ARMbased iPad Pro can never match in terms of universal usability The multicore GeekBench scores of this cheap Intel laptop CPU is high enough to decently run Office Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Photoshop CC and AutoCAD I think the current scenario is that majority of companies rely too much on their existing custommade x software for them to risk it all on the iPad Pro The cheaper Dell Venue Pro is more useful to companies which are not willing to spend more money just to port or virtualize their x software to run on ARMbased tabletslaptops Samsung OTCSSNLF Hewlett Packard NYSE HPQ and other highermargin Android device makers are also using the xZ The more CPURAMefficient Windows OS should give the xZ of the Dell Venue Pro a better realworld performance Dell also equipped the model of the Dell Venue Pro with GB of DDR RAM This should make multitasking a comfortable experience for officeroad workaholics Unlike the iPad Pro the cheapest model of the Dell Venue Pro also has a microSD slot which supports up to GB cards As for battery life Dells latest enterprise tablet will allegedly last for hours Like the Surface Pro the Dell Venue Pro also has a stylus However Dell opted to use Wacom OTCPKWACMY solutions for its digitizer pen rather than the Ntrig technology of the Surface Pen Enterprise IT managers may also fall for the preinstalled security measures on the Dell Venue Pro Dell will preinstall its Trusted Platform Module TPM and Dell Data ProtectionEncryption on its enterprise tablet The smaller Dell Venue Pro could also become a serious rival to the iPad Mini I opine that smaller inch tablets with stylus remain attractive to office users who dont like the in keyboardequipped tablet concept The onehandoperationfriendly Dell Venue Pro also has the same Intel xZ SoC It therefore has the same computing power and usability of its more expensive bigger sibling It is good that Intels mobile chips are getting more design wins from leading PC manufacturers Higher margins on enterprisecentric tablets mean Intel doesnt have to do any contrarevenue on DellMicrosoft tablets Intel is all about hardware profits Unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which can monetize buyers of its sub Windows phones via ads and Office subscriptions Intel doesnt have any other viable way to make money except from processor sales I believe that focusing more on highermargin tablets is more important than Intel meeting its annual sales target for tablet application processors While Intel indeed beat its million sales target for tablet application processors last year it also cost the company figure operating losses Dells loyalty to the Intel brand is a solid tailwind for Intel The more companies that realize x processors are still best for enterprise usage the better it is for Intel My premium account at I Know First Research told me its algorithm forecast only has a Neutral rating for the month future of INTC However I still say INTC is a Buy Intels stock is valued below its competitors This is in spite of the fact that it has no real rival anymore in the lucrative x desktopserver processor market As long as Dell Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY HP Asus Acer and other PC vendors ignore ARMbased processors for their highend PCserver products Intel remains a longterm winner for me We only use your contact details
