class='textDiv'>Why Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Making Huge Adjustments To Its GAAP Results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha On Tuesday after the market closed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT reported its fourth quarter and full year results beating estimates widely Ill take a look at the results and the adjustments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made to get to the numbers they have shown us <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported GAAP revenues of billion and GAAP earnings per share of The adjusted nonGAAP numbers were billion for the companys revenues and for Microsofts earnings per share Thats a huge discrepancy between reported and adjusted numbers but I believe these adjustments are justified at least partially The difference between reported and adjusted revenues billion is made up from Windows revenue deferrals entirely billion on a net impact basis I feel making this adjustment of including those Windows revenues in the adjusted number is justified as the revenues may not be earned yet in the accounting sense of the word but the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will render the respective services and thus earn those revenues in the future is almost guaranteed It thus makes sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to include those revenues in their adjusted revenue numbers These deferred Windows revenues are also responsible for billion in the difference between Microsofts reported net income billion and its adjusted net income billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has however also included million in impairment integration and restructuring expenses in its adjusted net income here the picture is a little different Since Microsofts restructuring expenses are not one time items but rather costs that occur very often excluding them in every earnings report can draw a wrong picture of the companys profitability The asset impairment charges as well as goodwill impairment charges are less of a problem since those are noncash costs but the restructuring expenses are cash costs and thus have a meaningful impact on not only the companys GAAP income but also on Microsofts cash flows Restructuring expenses which does not include asset impairment charges totaled million in the most recent quarter which is still a substantial number but only about half as much as last years Q restructuring expenses of million this is a positive Microsofts huge restructuring expenses are coming down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will start using a new revenue standard in two years July which will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to recognize all revenues at the time of billing which means the deferred revenues for Windows will be a thing of the past In combination with hopefully further falling restructuring expenses and asset as well as goodwill impairment charges this should lead to GAAP results being more in line with the nonGAAP numbers in the future Looking at Q results we see that adjusted currencyneutral revenues were up yoy which shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is moving in the right direction Intelligent Cloud has been the growth driver here up yoy in constant currency whereas More Personal Computing saw a revenue decline mainly due to the phone business cratering yoy Currency adjusted income grew currency adjusted net income grew a strong growth rate but impacted by a lower tax rate thus this huge growth rate was more of a one time thing Due to a lower share count Microsofts currency neutral adjusted earnings per share grew by an astonishing The difference between Microsofts net income and EPS growth rate is due to a the rather strong buyback pace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has shown over the last quarters the number of outstanding shares is dropping faster over the last few quarters than over previous years Due to Microsofts huge cash flows and fortress balance sheet investors can count on continuing substantial share repurchases which will allow for a huge boost to earnings per share growth over the next years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has returned a total of billion to its owners in the most recent quarter comprised of billion in dividends and billion in share repurchases This means a dividend yield of and a buyback pace of enough to move the needle significantly and adding to annual EPS growth in comparison to net income growth With its huge cash position and billion in quarterly free cash flows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can easily finance the current shareholder returns for a very long time even if free cash flows would not grow from the current level which is very likely they grew yoy in the most recent quarter Microsofts reported and adjusted earnings show huge discrepancies which can mostly be explained by the accounting methods used to recognize Windows revenues The asset impairments and restructuring expenses have an impact as well but are thankfully coming down in comparison to the prior year Microsofts core business revenues income and cash flows are all moving into the right direction and the companys shareholder returns are attractive When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>adopts its net revenue standard in two years the huge discrepancy between reported and nonGAAP results will likely be a thing of the past Authors note Dear readers if you enjoyed this article
