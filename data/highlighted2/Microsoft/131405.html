may operate on Tick Tock whereas PCCG will run on Tick Tock Tock Strategically this makes sense as it optimizes node efficiency on a highermargin product The integration of FPGAs will boost compute performance for largescale cloud vendors which will result in a more virtuous cycle for Intel Demand seems robust as demanding use cases have cropped up over the years The market has expanded in response to more powerful parts which is counter intuitive Intels NASDAQ INTC Data Center Group seems to be on the right track In fact its the only division that seems to be getting it right these days as the various other segments have under performed due to competitive issues or market dependent issues The stock has already responded to the weakness in PC fundamentals and should eventually find some support on the back of reassuring comments from management on DCG and ongoing developments in the data storage space I reviewed the QA session of Jason Waxman DCG Group Vice President which can be accessed on Intels Investor Relations website The conference got through a lot of pertinent information which helped me to further understand the durability of earnings going forward I cant cover everything but Im going to cover the three most pertinent points that surfaced throughout the conference call Intels DCG may run on a tick tock cycle whereas PCCG will run on tick tock tock This makes sense because server chips have higher margins and the initial ramp of a new process node tends to compress gross margins due to lessthanoptimal yields So pushing the server chips into a more advanced node will sustain Intels competitive advantage without impacting margins as significantly This gives Intel time to optimize for nm on the server side and develop more advanced architecture on the consumer side By the time consumer chips reach nm Intel will be able to maximize wafer production and conversion of nm capacity to nm will be less cost intensive The acquisition of Altera will give Intel the ability to create a truly comprehensive platform for coprocessors and GPGPUs For algorithms that are repetitive in nature ie file compressions crypto currency mining and various other compute heavy tasks that are heavily repetitive FPGAs fill in the hole Furthermore the energy efficiency and the ability to scale the FPGAs is a huge selling point for top cloud vendors The companies looking to implement FPGAs are at the cutting edge so think in terms of Google GOOG GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ Facebook NASDAQ FB and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN The performance advantage of a fully integrated platform has left alternative server ecosystems dead in the water ie ARM based servers Intel doesnt see meaningful deceleration in chip volumes even as reports indicate that the top cloud vendors are expected to reduce capex growth pertaining to data centers Perhaps demand is coming from alternative sources The growth rate in DCG seems to have held up pretty well which speaks volumes about the demanding computing needs that are being offloaded onto servers rather than being run on PCs Ideally Intel should have had a robust PCCG and DCG business but at least mobile growth comes accompanied with more demanding data center usage on the backend To conclude Intel is in a position of strength in the data center space and I dont anticipate competitors to encroach upon those higher power envelopes Intel has optimized its server CPU architecture over the years The simplicity of a cloud build out using Xeon CPUs and the better total cost of ownership has mitigated much of the hype presented by alternative platforms Therefore the high growth nature of the business and the mixshift to highermargin SKUs across server classCPUs keeps me optimistic However I didnt see any shift in prior financial guidance throughout the conference call therefore I continue to reiterate my price target
