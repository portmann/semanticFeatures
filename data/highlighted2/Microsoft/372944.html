Buyandhold investing with reinvested dividends has the potential to reward the patient investor with fantastic compounding growth over time If the investors timeline is long enough time can often heal poorly timed buyins but this is not guaranteed I am a fairly conservative valueoriented dividend growth investor I like beatendown blue chips low PE ratios yields with a history of annual increases buying with the intent of holding for life and dollar cost averaging techniques I find myself frequently challenged by investors with other strategies particularly folks in the momentumgrowth camp I originally performed the research for this article based on a challenge I was motivated by a comment I observed from a momentum growth investor criticizing the buyandhold investing strategy I have heard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT touted as a frequent example of the flaws of buyandhold investing strategy The argument posed is simple Investors who bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in and held until saw no return on their investment Ive heard that argument before an argument I was able to effectively tear down in the case of ConocoPhillips NYSE COP Investors who make such claims often conveniently forget to account for dividend reinvestments spinoffs and special distributions stock price charts lie when we are talking about strong dividend stocks such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The research that follows is my attempt to dismantle this assumed lie fully expecting to find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>performed adequately for investors who bought in at any historical price as long as they reinvested their dividends due to the companys strong dividend growth What I found surprised me Before the tech bubble burst in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was priced to perfection On December MSFT closed at an alltime high of share Microsofts diluted EPS for the previous four quarters ending December was and respectively giving it a nosebleed PE ratio of x Of course stock price charts dont tell the whole story <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>began paying dividends in If a hypothetical investor reinvested their dividends they would have had dozens of automatic buyins of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock well below their initial purchase price slowly whittling down the average cost into something much more manageable over time Or so I thought Dividends assumed to be reinvested at Closing Price For this exercise I assumed our hypothetical investor purchased worth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at its alltime high closing price of share This would have purchased shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock After enduring one for split in and separate dividend reinvestments without a single additional dollar of capital added to the initial purchase our hypothetical investor would own shares of MSFT today At Thursdays closing price of share our hypothetical investors investment is worth This means our hypothetical investor is still in the hole from their initial buyin in terms of purchasing power A Fantastic Growth Story With A Stagnating Stock Price On December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>closed at its apex of share On December MSFT closed at share In less than a year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>lost over of its value The company stayed rangebound from all the way to where it finally began breaking toward new highs Despite poor stock performance the underlying business engine was humming along <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continually posted impressive growth numbers throughout this time period Revenues increased YoY every single year except where they slipped a mere as the world crashed down around us Income and EPS have been a steady trek upward saw earnings contractions but they were due to a onetime impairment Only three times has impairment shown up on Microsofts balance sheet since This negative income does not appear in which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>currently trades with a forward PE of x as per Morningstar This reliable stellar growth allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to routinely increase its dividend Some wounds are too deep to be healed during our lifetimes and sometimes companies completely fold up shop and go to Buying and holding is never enough on its own and must be combined with other techniques to be successful long term For a buyandhold strategy to be effective the investment must be purchased at a reasonable price This can be done effectively using two wellknown methods Using value investing techniques to assess a margin of safety If the margin of safety is sufficient a single large lump sum with dividends reinvested over time has a better chance of delivering superior returns Using dollar cost averaging to slowly build a position over time Dollar cost averaging is also effective at recovering from point number one if the initial investment was not valued accurately enough by lowering the average cost of ownership of each share If our hypothetical investor invested the on December merely a year later the very same portfolio would be worth a healthy for a CAGR of Not stellar returns but adequate even after the tech bubble collapsed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still carried a high value Todays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a very different animal Because of the years of flat stock performance I believe there is a market perception that MSFT hasnt grown much as a company since the tech bubble especially when compared to its biggest competitor Apple NASDAQ AAPL which has seen tremendous stock price appreciation As shown with the charts above that is not the case Increases in revenues and earnings have been staggering since but the stock price has lagged because a massive bridge had to be built in the valuation gap from then until now Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trades at a forward PE of x has a healthy dividend exceptional revenue growth that has increased over the past three years and a below industry average debtequity ratio of While I do not believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a deep value play at current prices it does appear to be reasonably priced for a longterm investor who believes in the companys future and would like to go long For those looking to establish a longterm position with less risk <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does offer a Direct Stock Purchase Plan as well Disclosure I amwe are long MSFT AAPL I wrote this article myself and it
