class='textDiv'>Apples September Event iPad Pro Steals The Show Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apples iPad Pro is aimed at creative professionals in the enterprise iPad Pro continues the trend of Apples custom designed processors that are ever more capable and competitive with Intel Although the iPad Pro wont arrive until November Apple NASDAQ AAPL chose to thrust its new tablet into the limelight at its September event For good reason since the new iPad has the star power Apple has needed for some time Now the question for Apple investors becomes how will the Pro do at the box office In introducing the Pro Tim Cook declared that iPad is the clearest expression of our vision of personal computing This is perhaps the most explicit statement made by Apple that its iOS devices are a direct challenge to the Wintel enterprise hegemony Even as PC sales have faltered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Intel NASDAQ INTC have fallen back on what they apparently regarded as an unassailable bastion of productivity iPads and iPhones were mere toys for consuming content For real productivity a Windows PC was required iPad Pro is a direct assault on that bastion It borrows unabashedly from a machine I greatly admire the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface Pro The Pro has a large inch diagonal screen and with iOS will be able to multitask between two apps in a split screen mode The Pro also has provision for a removable keyboard like the Surface Pro and a stylus called Apple Pencil Apple has set its iPad Pro against what could be viewed as tough competition iOS vs Windows The ARM architecture AX system on chip SOC vs Intel Core processors Is this really reasonable Ultimately the market will decide but just the fact that Apple thinks that the Pro represents the future of personal computing says a lot It says that fundamentally theyre in agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that touch screens will become ubiquitous in personal computing There the agreement ends however as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has chosen to adapt its desktop OS to the needs of the touchscreen As such even Windows still has a poorly integrated feel to it But at least you can use a mouse or trackpad with it and sometimes you just need that Apple is set on maintaining the purity of the iOS experience so no touch pad on the detachable keyboard accessory of the new Pro iOS is a wonderful touch screen OS and with split screen multitasking it will be much more capable as a productivity platform But its still not quite in the same league as Win or Mac OS X I still maintain as I did in Apple Thinking Outside The iPad Box that a touch screen equipped Mac OS X convertible would be a better bet in the enterprise But Apple clearly is positioning the iPad Pro for that role This may not matter to many prospective customers The demos of the Pro at the special event mostly focused on creative professionals Graphic design and page layout featured prominently For this type of enterprise customer the Pro could be an easy sell Especially because the Apple Pencil appears to be the stylus done better than anything that has come before This is where Apples control of hardware and software design really pays off The Pencil is both pressure and tilt sensitive so that it can be used more like a physical writing instrument The Pencil is going to be enormously popular While the Pencil is a nice touch its the AX SOC that really sets the iPad Pro apart from its Intel based competition Its low enough power to be fanless of course which puts it in the same group as the new Skylake Core M series of SOCs Quite possibly the next gen Surface Pro will use Skylake When Intel rolled out Skylake at the beginning of the month they took pains to point out that the Core M was twice as fast as the previous generation AX in the iPad Air Apple appears to have closed that gap with the AX since it also claims twice the performance of the AX The AX is fabricated on a nm FinFET process probably Samsungs allowing it to be more powerful and more energy efficient Well know more about the performance of the AX once Apple starts shipping devices but probably the AX and the Skylake M are roughly comparable Here I give Apple the advantage based on what is typically the lower cost of ARM architecture processors of equivalent performance to Intel The AX also incorporates all the motion sensing functions that were carried in the M motion coprocessor for the iPad Air In this we see a fundamental advantage of Apple being a system integrator for SOCs As process nodes shrink Apple can take advantage of this by incorporating the functionality it specifically wants on the SOC rather than accepting an array of functions it doesnt need in a generic commodity processor So the Pro doesnt quite have the industrial strength caliber of Windows but it has better hardware than the Surface Pro and possibly better hardware than the Surface Pro when it comes out iOS while lighter weight has the advantages of not having a lot of legacy software baggage to lug around and a much cleaner and more intuitive user interface On the face of it it might be a tight race only I dont expect it to be at all This really has mostly to do with Windows Now that Ive been using Windows for a while Ive realized that its not really that much better than Windows I upgraded the one PC I had that was running My other machines that are running Windows Im going to leave alone I expect that most enterprise users of Windows will probably do the same thing especially since enterprise users of Win and Win dont get the free upgrade Windows is looming as an even bigger problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>than Windows XP In the consumer market I dont expect Win to be a catalyst for new PC sales growth including Surface and Surface Pro Most value conscious Windows users will choose the free upgrade to Win instead of buying a new machine This only makes sense Win provides a host of modern features such as an app store and a performance boost compared to Windows As I pointed out in Apple The Stark Contrast Between iPad and Surface Sales even with the sales declines iPad has suffered in the past year iPad still outsold Surface and Surface Pro in terms of revenue in the June quarter At the very least I expect the iPad line bolstered by iPad Pro to hold this ratio Now that Ive seen the iPad Pro and understand what the hardware can do Im standing by my prediction made in that article that the iPad Pro will halt the yy decline in iPad sales for at least the next few quarters of Pro availability Whether iPad unit sales in the December quarter will equal last years million will depend on availability of the iPad Pro If the Pro isnt supply constrained total iPad sales could easily exceed last years amount Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no
