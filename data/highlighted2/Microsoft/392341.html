influential individuals as well as some vendors in attending VMwares NYSE VMW annual VMworld conference runs from Aug Sep this year He thinks this is due to the diminished strategic importance of VMwares vSphereESXi server virtualization platform in an IT landscape where Amazon Web Services increasingly looms large Pott A picture is slowly emerging of the future of IT In the middle is Amazon or at the very least software and services built on top of Amazon Around that lies everything else a web of public private and service providerhosted workloads radiating out like a spiders web This is a future where VMware could still be the glue that binds together the data center however that data center is but one point along the edges of tomorrows IT design Beyond all of that vSphereESXi is facing growing competition from Microsofts HyperV and opensource virtualization solutions such as Xen and KVM However as its Q numbers show vSphererelated license bookings declined sharply but bookings for PCmobile SDNnetwork virtualization and storage virtualization offerings saw strong growth VMware isnt blind to these trends SA contributor Doug Young LinkedIn Networks In China With
