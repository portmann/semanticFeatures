class='textDiv'>Generating A Month From <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Often investors just starting out can be intimidated when thinking about a lofty retirement goal This article illustrates a way to think about creating intermediate objectives Beginning the process can be the hardest part as motivation tends to increase alongside your passive income When youre first starting out in the investing world it can be discouraging to see a dividend check here or payments there With the concept of eventually living off of your passive income stream it seems like such a large jump to get from pennies a day to thousands a month In turn it can be easy to give up quickly or at least not put as much effort into the process from the beginning To combat this type of thinking I believe that it can be useful to set up intermediate goals Instead of thinking about a large round number in the future say million or in annual passive income lets break it down a bit Often I like to talk about covering expenses with your investments as a first step to see the investing process working You start small For instance perhaps your monthly cereal expenditure equates to or so Thats for the year Kellogg NYSE K presently pays a quarterly dividend or on an annual basis If you accumulated shares youd begin to generate annually effectively covering your cereal expenditures for life That makes sense as a good first step to me You start at and then you think about a goal that can be accomplished in the short term In this case it would take shares of Kellogg at a current cost of about to have breakfast covered Whether this takes you a quarter or a year or two the idea is to set out an achievable goal to align your aim Youre not thinking about retirement youre thinking about taking care of breakfast first Once you start to hit some intermediate goals you can begin to up the stakes Once more thinking about covering an expense makes sense from a goal setting standpoint but keep in mind that youre not limited to only investing in the businesses you purchase from although thats a reasonable place to begin looking With this concept in mind I wanted to explore the idea of generating a month from a security like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a unique history that differs a bit from your typical dividend growth company During the through period investors would have seen a annualized gain turning a starting investment into or thereabouts When you see that sort of start and end point its easy to imagine a nice smooth linear uptrend Yet that has hardly been the case The revenue growth was quite impressive coming in at over annually The quality of those sales had decreased slightly resulting in a lower profit margin and companywide earnings growth of just over per year In addition to the dividend the company has also been retiring a fair amount of shares roughly one out of every four shareholders have been bought out in the last years resulting in EPS growth of about per annum However the roller coaster ride wasnt over quite yet The companys earnings multiple went from about down to resulting in share price growth of less than Add in the dividend and you come to a total return of just over And thats prior to thinking about the massive volatility that previously occurred around the tech bubble Which brings us to today During the second fiscal quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had billion in cash equivalents and shortterm investments thats ignoring all other assets as compared to total liabilities of billion And there are other things to like about the business in addition to the strong balance sheet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stands to benefit from increased cloud use and continues to milk the cash cow legacy businesses as the Azure platform grows rapidly Moreover analysts expect intermediateterm growth to come in near per annum Naturally future prospects do not have to come to fruition but this type of thing nonetheless lays out the groundwork for why an investor might be interested in the company and in this case generating income from owning the security For a long time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>did not pay a dividend and was better known for its exceptional growth and skyhigh valuation But as noted above a lot has changed in the last decade especially on the dividend front Back in the company initiated a dividend and in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made its income presence known in big way with a large special dividend Since the quarterly dividend has increased by an annual rate of about with the current mark sitting at Based on a share price near this equates to a starting dividend yield of about Now lets think about getting to an intermediate goal One hundred dollars per month equals per year So if you wanted to generate this expected amount from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>today you would need to own about shares The payments would be quarterly but the annual amount would be roughly correct At present this income stream from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would cost around For some thats possible but for most that sort of thing is presently out of reach Yet we need not despair quite yet You can get there over time Moreover there are some things that will help you along the way namely organic payout growth reinvestment and new capital <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>presently pays out around half of its profits in the form of dividends Earnings are expected to grow reasonably quickly near over the intermediate term Taking these two items in together and using a bit of caution perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could increase its payout by annually Heres what that might look like So instead of needing to accumulate shares you could think about it as needing to accumulate shares after years granted the purchasing power would likely be less but the idea is that organic dividend growth can help in this endeavor The second part of getting there over time is the concept that reinvesting will boost your total income growth rate Imagine that you have saved up for the year to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Naturally this could instead be invested in a collection of holdings but well use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in this instance to illustrate the concept A beginning investment would purchase almost shares The annual expected dividend equates to receiving in annual dividends already on your way now collecting an average of per month for this decision At the end of the year or before you could choose to spend those payments or reinvest If you spent every dime of dividends you would still anticipate more income next year Youd keep your shares and expect next years per share payment to generate in annual income or approximately a increase using round numbers Incidentally this is a great appeal for dividend growth investors getting a raise each year for doing nothing Of course if you elect to reinvest your income prospects can improve At the end of year one you have in cash dividends With this you could elect to add say new shares of the company In turn your annual expected cash flow would go up to or so instead of You were able to increase your annual dividend income by instead of This doesnt seem like a large difference to start but it begins to compound over time The third avenue that you have available to you is adding new capital If at the start of the second year you elected to invest another you could effectively double your share count with reinvested dividends included and assuming a higher share price Your anticipated income for the year would now be around From there you could reinvest the funds and add new capital again repeating the wealth and income building process After six years of investing and reinvesting your annual expected income would be over youve reached your intermediate goal From there you could think about reaching your goal in purchasing power terms or else keep on going toward the next mark Youll find that once the process starts to build from a check up to a month to and then month etc the enjoyment begins to build Suddenly you have passive income coming in that can generate its own passive income making machines In short its not about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or any security in particular And its not even about a given level of passive income Instead the concept is to figure out your goals and back out a way to get there In this particular example if you saved a day for six years you could have an asset generating a month or more on your personal balance sheet Once the ball is rolling with more and more passive income to deploy the motivation tends to become inherent The process becomes more enjoyable You can adjust for your personal ambitions the important part and sometimes most difficult part is getting started
