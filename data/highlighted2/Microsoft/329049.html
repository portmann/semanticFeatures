of the future and the role of AI in it Welcome to the Facebook NASDAQ FB edition of my series on the AI market Artificial intelligence AI and algorithms capable of extracting meaningful insights from data are in the process of transforming the technology industry and the society at large The articles in this series are meant to provide orientation to investors interested in the longterm trends and developments in this niche The previous installments dealt with Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL DeepMinds progress in deep reinforcement learning IBMs NYSE IBM Watson and Apples NASDAQ AAPL secrecy In this article we turn to Facebook and its AI play A Brief History Of Facebook AI Research FAIR FB initiated its AI research initiative around the time Google acquired DeepMind late early I learned first about it when I read this Facebook status update by the FAIR director and wellknown neural network researcher Yann LeCun which made the rounds in the research community Yann LeCun is especially well known in the AI community for his work on convolutional neural networks CNNs in the context of computer vision and object recognition In fact he was probably the best any amount of money could buy in this specific niche Facebook also hired statistical learning legend Vladimir Vapnik among others What I would really like to stress here is that it takes some serious effort to get these kind of people interested In my Apple article I pointed out how AAPL is exactly not doing this It hires largely entrylevel machinelearning engineers or freshoutofgradschool PhDs or acquihires small startups instead of trying to get leading figures interested which it could only do through money since it seemingly would not be allowed to publish The first major result of Facebooks AI efforts was DeepFace a deeplearning facial recognition mechanism that achieved humanlevel performance in mid Now facial recognition in itself is not new For instance a classical approach to do this the Eigenface algorithm is based on linear algebra you might learn in your first year in college create a mean average face and then recognize faces by measuring how they differ from the mean face by considering their principal components directions of maximum variance This of course is far from humanlevel performance on practical social network image data because people do not upload exclusively normalized closeup frontal face pictures with homogeneous lighting The interesting and relevant contribution of Facebook was the robustness of the algorithm with regards to angles lighting and facial expressions This was achieved by not just comparing raw pixel values of faces to look for similarities but by constructing a D model of a face that can then be flattened out to create a frontalized version of distorted images I think the specifics of this process are not terribly interesting to investors mostly because this is old news right now and not some new development The takeaway is that FB made a concentrated effort towards image recognition around late that in terms of research progress timelines quickly resulted in a productionready system DeepFace has been live for a year now This work apparently began years back before the creation of FAIR with the acquisition of other computer vision startups eg facecom and came to fruition shortly after Facebook went on its FAIR hiring spree If we think about Facebooks overall business strategy concentrating its AI efforts on computer vision makes sense FBs mission statement is to connect humans globally To do this the company wants to be able to recognize humans from any type of data Of course it is also heavily working on natural language processing NLP to extract adrelevant insights from posts which is more straight forward than understanding images However NLP was already a relatively mature field with powerful statistical methods regarding text parsing and eventsentity or contextual analysis Image data is so interesting because it is so rich of information First Facebook wants to know who you are and where you are see its new drone project that again uses computer vision to determine where humans are living If you write a status update or post on a friends wall or comment on someones Instagram you want to achieve a certain social status effect lets not fool ourselves there are no random posts Its controlled Images and even more so video sequences reveal an enormous depth of emotions desires and connections between people and their environment If you think a little further down the line regarding Facebooks investment in virtual reality with Oculus you can see how important it will be for the companys longterm future to be able to extract adrelevant insights from visual sequences Hence it made a lot of sense for Facebook to appoint a leading machine vision researcher to lead FAIR Facebook has also done work on an intelligent assistant similar to Siri or Cortana While the former two are purely machine based and hence often fail to deliver answers to complex queries M seems to be a hybrid that uses human operators at least for some things An interesting post on proving that M is at least parthuman can be found here As something of a side note M illustrates the current problem of machine learning scalability Scaling out M to billion users is problematic and it will be interesting to see how it moves forward with the project especially when its Beta sees to require human operators FAIR also has a project on automated text understanding and reasoning that fits within this goal Facebook is not just interested in specific subtopics of AI even though it might have more immediate impact on the companys ad business FAIR has recently released a report called A Roadmap towards Machine Intelligence where it outlines its longterm vision towards an intelligent machine This is not a technical paper and does not contain any math so if you are interested in AI go ahead and read it Otherwise let me summarize it for you The report begins by listing the practical demands that we would have when using a machine intelligence eg communication learning memory and generalization The more interesting part is how the authors propose achieving this through a simulation environment that confronts the machine with incrementally more difficult task sequences The idea is to sort of foster the machines capabilities in a simulation where it both learns from assigned tasks with rewards as well as is allowed to explore on its own through a range of inputoutput channels like the Internet Now this might all sound quite abstract and it is easy to fantasize about how an AI should look that does not get us any way closer to it The relevant point is that the authors have a different idea about how to achieve AI than say Google DeepMind As I outlined in my DeepMind article the deep reinforcement learning approach aims to learn separate tasks from a single architecture that just requires sensory input images and a reward signal to learn The authors of the road map report borrow many ideas from reinforcement learning but argue for an incremental approach that modularizes learned skills and relies on natural language interaction to guide learning Conclusion An Integrated Incremental Strategy This incremental approach fits in with what we have seen overall Facebook is very good at leveraging its AI efforts into direct product releases Yet it clearly has a longterm vision towards machine intelligence that goes beyond delivering specific features for its business In that sense Facebook and Google are unique because they are led by their founders who strongly believe in AI as a longterm solution to the worlds problems the solve AI and then solve everything else with it paradigm In contrast companies driven by more technocratic managers like IBM will always prioritize generating revenue from existing techniques rather than spending billions on leading the charge into the next generation of methods I am not saying this is wrong it is just a consequence of the way public companies work The takeaway from that is that Google and Facebook are both expending massive resources into bringing a general intelligence into existence Google DeepMind has committed to its reinforcement learning approach and is making rapid progress there in fact after the Go playing paper it immediately published another paper on asynchronous reinforcement learning that did not gain much media attention but demonstrated a completely revised approach to asynchronous parallel learning in the example of learning how to escape from a labyrinth While there are other players in the AI and machinelearning market that we have yet to cover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Baidu NASDAQ BIDU Google and Facebook are unique in the way they are driven by their leaders in the direction of a general solution to intelligence As of right now Google seems to be a bit further ahead having committed to an approach and executing on it with a wordclass team that is steadily growing by hiring new superstar researchers FB is still figuring out a roadmap towards a general approach but has shown very capable of integrating its incremental progress into its products along the way In the grand scheme of things these companies and their leaders are still relatively young Expect big things in the coming decades if they keep up their Manhattan projects of AI Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
