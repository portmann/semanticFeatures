has acquired companies for talent and intellectual property rather than for inorganic growth GoPros forthcoming airborne drones may attract Apple as part of a general interest in robotics Northland analyst Gus Richard recently characterized GoPro NASDAQ GPRO as a compelling acquisition target for Apple NASDAQ AAPL Motley Fools Leo Sun has presented his case for an Apple acquisition Although theres a case to be made for acquisition it would be out of character for Apple Apple may well want to expand into robotics however and for that iRobot NASDAQ IRBT would be a better fit GoPros stock has been taking a beating in the past month down nearly so this may in part be fueling the speculation of an Apple purchase Since Richards comment on Monday the stock is up as of Wednesdays close Also theres been a long standing perception that GoPro and Apple might be on a collision course see my GoPro Apple Is Not The Threat Certainly GoPro investors would rather join Apple than try to beat it Theres a tendency to see a GoPro acquisition as analogous to the Beats acquisition and this is the crux of Suns case for it He points to GoPros action cameras and video ecosystems as natural extensions of Apple iOS hardware and ecosystem Sun is right of course but then the same could be said of many consumer electronics products that Apple doesnt make such as home theater systems or electronic musical instruments A GoPro acquisition runs afoul of principles that have guided Apple acquisitions since Tim Cook became COO under Steve Jobs The key principle is not to pursue growth for the sake of growth The corollary to this is to only seek acquisitions that enhance Apples core business by adding talent and intellectual property So Apple could go around buying up all sorts of consumer electronics companies but its not doing that If Beats had consisted only of the headphone and speaker business Im sure Apple wouldnt have bothered It was Beats Music that Apple wanted because it knew that the future of its iTunes content business was in subscription streaming GoPro falls outside of Apples core business of personal computing devices of various sorts Except for Beats Apple hasnt wanted to venture much into accessories preferring to feature other companys accessories in its stores as it does with GoPro Sun also makes the argument that GoPro would be relatively cheap about billion with an acquisition premium This would actually be a large part of Apples domestic cash holding estimated to be about billion billion would be a lot for Apple to spend on a noncore business for the sake of growth it doesnt need If the above considerations were the only ones in play I would probably have formulated the title of this article as an assertion rather than a question My doubts about a GoPro acquisition revolve around its recently announced intention to produce personal aerial drones Drones are a logical extension of GoPros business Apple appears to have along with much of the consumer electronics industry an interest in robotics Robots are fundamentally computing devices so they fit within Apples core competency Robots also have the potential to be incredibly useful for people and therefore a huge potential market The much rumored selfdriving Apple Car project can be thought of as just the most obvious form of consumer robot as well as the most expensive Another important form of overlap between robotics and Apples core business stems from the fact that its still very difficult for robots to carry around enough smarts to be useful The obvious solution is to rely on cloud computing to provide the artificial intelligence that robots need Apple and its competitors such as Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT already do that for their robot assistants such as Siri Next to a self driving car autonomous or semiautonomous airborne drones are possibly the most desirable consumer robots and the most likely to appear in mass use in the near future Drones properly endowed with cloudbased smarts could be useful for more than taking a cool new type of selfie Drones could run errands picking up or dropping off small packages They also could provide remote surveillance of children or look for lost children or pets Of course the utility of drones will depend on establishment of regulations and infrastructure conducive to their use Development of an air traffic control system for drones may pose a considerable technical hurdle that limits the use of autonomous drones GoPros development of drones could be the factor that tips the scale in favor of an acquisition However Apple might want something a little closer to home literally and a lot more affordable Given Apples recent push into the home through iOS connected devices such as light dimmers and thermostats iRobot might be a better choice iRobot isnt as profitable as GoPro In the June quarter GoPro had operating income of million on revenue of million while iRobot had million in operating income on revenue of million GoPro also is growing much faster with yy revenue growth vs for iRobot But once again Apple doesnt usually acquire companies for their revenue streams iRobots little Roomba vacuum cleaners arent as sexy as drones or even action cameras but iRobot also has some other interesting products such as the Ava Mobile Robotics Platform which is endowed with considerably greater intelligence At a market cap of only million iRobot is considerably more affordable than GoPro Its also such a good fit as the next idevice Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than
