Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQ MSFT shares plunged toward the end of August and have yet to fully recover but thats a good thing for those who think great things are ahead for the software giant Theres still a ways to go before investors and analysts will become more constructive on the company but one firm is now slightly less bearish on it Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Kash Rangan and Scott Shiao have upgraded <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>from Underperform to Neutral and raised their price objective to per share They give three reasons for the upgrade The first is the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares have underperformed the broader market so far this year The stock has declined year to date compared to the NASDAQs decline since the beginning of the year Second they note that the second half of fiscal brings much easier comparisons for the March and June quarters for Windows Pro The March quarter goes against a decline while the June quarter is up against a decline And third they say having a dividend yield and price to earnings ratio of times excluding cash are both solid defensive strategies as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>deals with uncertainty The BAML team also said the things they wanted to see have come to pass like the headwind of XP to Windows has now gone by Also they say the bullish sellside hopes for earnings per share of in fiscal have dissipated as have the downward revisions and high hopes for there to be a PC refresh cycle with Windows They note that its hard to determine exactly when and where the PC market will bottom out as it declined another during the second quarter The BAML analysts said the reversal of positive impacts from Windows XP and the clearing of inventory channels going into the Windows release drove that decline and were both temporary Upside potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the Cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been making progress in its shift away from a traditional software licensing model toward a Cloudbased model One of the main parts of this transition is getting commercial Office users to shift over to Office subscriptions Rangan and Shiao note that there could be quite a difference in gross margins between these two products They estimate a gross margin on commercial Office licensing and a margin for Office subscriptions Of course if Microsofts margins on Office continue to outperform as recent incremental gross margins have been in excess of to then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could see an even greater positive earnings per share impact than the to cents theyre estimating right now The other impact associated with a shift to the Cloud is getting nonannuity users to go to annuity They say even in a bear case Offices earnings contribution could trough at cents per share in fiscal and balloon up to cents per share in fiscal Of course the BAML team does still rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at Neutral because they still have a number of concerns about the company and its stock One of their biggest concerns is the deferral recognition of Windows revenue Another is the impact of all the free upgrades <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been handing out Theyre also concerned about the possibility that the transition to the Cloud will take longer than expected and that expectations for to compound annual growth for Office might be too aggressive Further they see the possibility of headwinds from the Server refresh and think it might end up being similar to the headwinds faced from the Windows XP to Windows refresh And finally they say it will be harder to gauge Microsofts progress in the Cloud
