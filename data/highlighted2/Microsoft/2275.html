class='textDiv'>Exclusive Microsofts digital assistant to head to Android Apple devices Reuters SEATTLE Reuters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is working on an advanced version of its competitor to Apples Siri using research from an artificial intelligence project called Einstein <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been running its personal assistant Cortanaon its Windows phones for a year and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of Windows this autumn Later Cortana will be available as a standalone app usable on phones and tablets powered by Apple Incs AAPLO iOS and Google Incs GOOGO Android people familiar with the project said This kind of technology which can read and understand email will play a central role in the next roll out of Cortana which we are working on now for the fall time frame said Eric Horvitz managing director of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Research and a part of the Einstein project in an interview at the companys Redmond Washington headquarters The plan to put Cortana on machines running software from rivals such as Apple and Google as well as the Einstein project have not been reported Cortana is the name of an artificial intelligence character in the video game series Halo They represent a new front in CEO Satya Nadellas battle to sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>software on any device or platform rather than trying to force customers to use Windows Success on rivals platforms could create new markets and greater relevance for the company best known for its decadesold operating system The concept of artificial intelligence is broad and mobile phones and computers already show dexterity with spoken language and sifting through emails for data for instance Still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>believes its work on speech recognition search and machine learning will let it transform its digital assistant into the first intelligent agent which anticipates users needs By comparison Siri is advertised mostly as responding to requests Googles mobile app which doesnt have a name like Siri or Cortana already offers some limited predictive information cards based on what it thinks the user wants to know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has tried to create digital assistants before without success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Bob released in was supposed to make using a computer easy but ended up being the butt of jokes The Office Assistant nicknamed Clippy suffered a similar fate a few years later Were defining the competitive landscape of who can provide the most supportive services that make life easier keep track of things that complement human memory in a way that helps us get things done said Horvitz Outside his door stands The Assistant a monitor showing a womans face that can converse with visitors has access to Horvitzs calendar and can book meetings On his desktop Horvitz runs Lifebrowser a program that stores everything from appointments to photos and uses machine learning to identify the important moments A keyword search for his university professor instantly brings up photos and video from the last time they met Cortana could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight It would automatically check flight status determine where the phone is located using GPS and checking traffic conditions None of the individual steps are a breakthrough but creating an artificial intelligence that can stitch together the processes marks a breakthrough in usefulness <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>says Rivals are on the same track Googles latest mobile app uses the predictive power generated from billions of searches to work out what a user is doing what they are interested in and sending relevant information such as when a favorite sports team is playing next Apple is also pushing Siri which uses Microsofts Bing search engine in the background into new areas with its CarPlay and HomeKit platforms as well as the recently unveiled Apple Watch The key to Cortanas success will be knowing where a user is what time it is and what they are trying to do Albert Einsteins work on the relationship between space and time gave rise to Microsofts secret project name said Horvitz Einstein was brilliant about space and time he said Its using brilliance about space
