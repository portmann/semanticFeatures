<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel have money flowing in Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money TV Program Tuesday October There have been sectors bringing down the whole market like banks energy tech and the industrial sector to some extent But lately the biotech sector is hurting the market badly as they have been behaving like the oil stocks Its not highgrowth stocks alone but consistent largecaps too In short biotech has become a pariah and it is infecting everything said Cramer Many think that biotechs started falling over the concerns of price gouging after Hillary Clintons tweet but the truth is that there was a big downturn with many development stage biotechs peaking even without earnings There were many IPOs and secondary offerings Drugs that cost a lot are called orphan drugs as they are created for a small group of people with a lifethreatening disease I think there will be some companies that wont be able to pass along onerous markups but really we are in a when the smoke clears situation where the smoke is headline risk said Cramer Due to the issue there is pin action in the biotech stocks that have nothing to do with pricing like McKesson NYSE MCK and AmerisourceBergen NYSE ABC This kind of selling is way overdone and it smacks of wholesale liquidation of anything that has higher growth than other cohorts added Cramer He thinks that the biotech infection is just localized and although it can do damage it doesnt mean that investors should stay away At some point stocks will get cheap compared to their growth and investors will not be able to ignore them I believe we are real close if not there already said Cramer In the market selloff cybersecurity stocks have taken a big beating The once loved group has declined drastically and the PureFunds ISE cybersecurity ETF NYSEARCA HACK is down from its high Individual stocks have fallen even more and it might be time for investors to look at the group again to buy stocks at a discount At these levels I think it is possible that the once highflying cybersecurity stocks might actually represent value even as they are still fairly expensive on an earnings basis said Cramer Some of these companies have exceptional multiyear growth ahead Due to limited ETFs for the group of stocks money tends to flow out of the group at a much faster rate and has a strong pin action Cramer thinks Palo Alto Networks NYSE PANW is the gold standard for the group FireEye NASDAQ FEYE and CyberArk NASDAQ CYBR have a higher riskreward ratio on longterm volatile plays Cramer is not calling a bottom on this group but these stocks have come down a great deal and cant be ignored based on the growth potential He recommended using a deep inthemoney call option strategy to curb downside Another safe way to play the group is by owning Cisco NASDAQ CSCO which trades at times earnings and has a dividend yield Pepsi NYSE PEP vs DuPont NYSE DD Pepsi is a consumer foods company and DuPont is a chemical company Both the companies reported earnings in which Pepsi was the clear winner They do have one big thing in common and on that front the contrast couldnt be more stark Thats because Trian Partners the activist fund run by Nelson Peltz tried to effect change at both companies said Cramer Both the CEOs Nooyi and Kullman reacted differently when Peltz tried changing both companies Nooyi welcomed Peltz on the board and while he wanted to break Pepsi into two companies Nooyi kept his criticism at bay and posted good results with the single entity Kullman on the other hand won the proxy fight with Peltz and the battle was a waste of time and resources According to Cramer Peltz wasnt after Kullman he just wanted to bring change in Dupont and unlock value He was denied a board seat and when he failed to win against Kullman the stock started to plummet after it reached The truth though is that this hideous guide down something that Peltz predicted would happen was the last straw as the board recognized that someone else could do a better job he added After weeks of turmoil we can not only spot the stocks that money is flying out of we can also see the areas where money is flowing in and old tech has been providing new but uncertain leadership in this tumultuous period said Cramer With the help of technician Bob Lang Cramer reviewed technical charts for old tech companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Intel NASDAQ INTC After the collapse in August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has rallied and Intel has moved up The daily chart of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shows that it has made higher highs and higher lows showing strength versus the rest of the market The trajectory of the stocks is positive and it is trading above the day and day moving average Clearly money managers are flowing into the stock as it is off its high The market is expecting the company to report good numbers in the coming weeks Intel on the other hand has a similar picture It has pulled up other semiconductor stocks along with it More importantly Intels daily chart shows an inverse headandshoulders pattern which is a positive formation suggesting a bullish stance of the market Lang thinks that Intel can reach He also pointed out that the stocks day moving average is below the day moving average but he expects that to change soon If you want to buy Intel I suggest putting on a little bit of your position if we get some weakness before the earnings report and then waiting until after the quarter to buy the rest said Cramer CEO interview Premier NASDAQ PINC Premier is a biotech company that allows hospitals and doctors to save on medical supplies and helps them improve quality of healthcare They have a data analytics business that helps customers save money and get quality improvements They use the collective buying power of clients to get drugs and supplies at cheaper prices The politicians could really benefit the stock due to the drug pricing war going on Cramer interviewed CEO Susan DeVore to find out why their stock plummeted when they were a clear beneficiary of the drug pricing movement We actually try to create competitive friction between companies so they drive the price down We actually have B of spend that runs through our purchasing organization And what we are able to do uniquely is bring clinical information together with pricing information to really figure out what is appropriate said DeVore She added that the company serves M customers and the healthcare industry can save more as the industry is fragmented She added that the government alone cannot solve the pricing issue and neither can insurers Premier is helping bring competitive pricing power to affect pricing and they have a huge footprint Rockwell Medical NASDAQ RMTI Cramer would prefer buying Celgene NASDAQ CELG in batches as it goes down Perrigo NYSE PRGO This stock is worth much more without Mylans NASDAQ MYL bid Dunkin Brands NASDAQ DNKN Cramer was disappointed with the
