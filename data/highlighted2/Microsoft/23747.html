of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>were trading near as compared to todays mark closer to Given this information you might suppose that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been a poor investment At the end of shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT were trading at a splitadjusted price near In turn this also means that the earnings multiple during this time was in the range but for the moment lets side step that information Today shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>exchange hands around As such it seems obvious that this hasnt been a great investment you lost in capital depreciation Even if you include dividends received an initial investment at the end of would have compounded at a negative rate Every that you invested back then would only be worth or so today This is the essence of media sensationalism and why a typical investor might get spooked out of consistently investing Its easy to picture the dot com crash or the recent recession and suppose that these types of events will occur again The logic is on point but not the takeaway In the future we will see tribulations economic crisis and instances where stock prices do nothing or worse for prolonged periods as was the case with the above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>example However it does not follow that this automatically translates to poor investing returns quite the contrary actually This is a situation or a situational folly that I like to call onetime investing The media likes to tell tales like the one above to catch your attention They tell you that the NASDAQ has done nothing over the past years or that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still selling below its tech bubble high today Its not inaccurate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is selling below today Yet this is quite misleading Producing statements like these makes a very critical mistake it assumes you invest just once It assumes that you invest at the very highest possible point and then sit around sucking your thumb for the next years hoping something good might happen Of course this is not reality Instead of making a single investment in your lifetime you make hundreds perhaps thousands Instead of plopping down a lump sum at the high you likely invest regularly say twice a month monthly or at worst yearly Why Well thats when you get paid Even if you wanted to make that onetime lump sum investment that so many often refer to you probably couldnt do it Not because it could be misguided but because you cant convince your employer or customers to pay for years of work upfront Instead you periodically earn money which you can then take a portion to periodically invest Thus the onetime investment while headline grabbing rarely if ever occurs With that perspective in mind lets reexamine the awful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investment that you could have made However this time instead of investing just once lets imagine that you invest at the end of each and every year starting with Heres what annual investments would look like From the above table we can glean a variety of information First notice the row Indeed if you were to make a investment at the end of the share price today would be just over and the total value still under Note that the end price is as of the April th close but the dividends received only carry through the end of This investment has not yet been productive Yet take a look at through In every single instance the end share price is higher and the total value is above This is a much more realistic picture Instead of investing just once youre apt to invest consistently and over a great deal of time decades for instance A secondary realization comes in the way of looking not at the worst possible investment during this period as the media often does but in reviewing the best of times Had you bought shares at the end of your investment would now have a total value over This is better even than when the share price was just higher and you would have had more time to collect dividends However thats not exactly the takeaway Heres the point at the end of shares were trading around but by the end of shares were closer to As such given price appreciation in one year you might have thought that you missed the boat Yet that wasnt exactly the case Heres a look at the annual compound returns starting from the end of each year Obviously the end would have been a solid time to invest But this also holds for and despite the higher share price This is the type of thing thats difficult to discern from a stock chart When you see a high mark back in and then a lower price today its easy to discount the security You could call it dead money or suggest that it has gone nowhere Yet when you go through an exercise like the one above important realizations emerge Saying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>traded at in and is presently trading around today is only useful if you made a onetime investment and sat around for the next years A more relevant scenario would be to see what happens over time to see what happens when you think about the reality of investing Youre going to be doing this for a long time As such it makes sense to judge both your investments and future prospects on a variety of timelines Source <span style='background-color:
