the weaponization of robots and the ongoing military artificial intelligence arms race Overnight we got a vivid example of just how quickly artificial intelligence can spiral out of control when Microsofts AIpowered Twitter chat robot Tay became a racist misogynist Obamahating antisemitic incest and genocidepromoting psychopath when released into the wild For those unfamiliar Tay is or rather was an AI project built by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Technology and Research and Bing teams in an effort to conduct research on conversational understanding It was meant to be a bot anyone can talk to online The company described the bot as Microsofts AI fam the internet thats got zero chill <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>initially created Tay in an effort to improve the customer service on its voice recognition software According to MarketWatch she was intended to tweet like a teen girl and was designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation The chat algo is able to perform a number of tasks like telling users jokes or offering up a comment on a picture you send her for example But shes also designed to personalize her interactions with users while answering questions or even mirroring users statements back to them As Twitter users quickly came to understand Tay would often repeat back racist tweets with her own commentary Where things got even more uncomfortable is that as TechCrunch reports Tays responses were developed by a staff that included improvisational comedians That means even as she was tweeting out offensive racial slurs she seemed to do so with abandon and nonchalance There was everything racist outbursts Nwords conspiracy theories genocide incest etc As some noted Tay really lost it and the biggest embarrassment was for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which had no idea its AI would implode so spectacularly and right in front of everyone To be sure none of this was programmed into the chat robot which was immediately exploited by Twitter trolls as expected and demonstrated just how unprepared for the real world even the most advanced algo really is Some pointed out that the devolution of the conversation between online users and Tay supported the Internet adage dubbed Godwins law This states as an online discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apparently became aware of the problem with Tays racism and silenced the bot later on Wednesday after hours of chats Tay announced via a tweet that she was turning off for the night but she has yet to turn back on Humiliated by the whole experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>explained what happened The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project designed for human engagement It is as much a social and cultural experiment as it is technical Unfortunately within the first hours of coming online we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tays commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways As a result we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also deleted many of the most offensive tweets however copies were saved on the Socialhax website where they can still be found TayTweets TayandYou March We are confident well be seen much more of her soon when the chat program
