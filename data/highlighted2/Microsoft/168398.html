attractive upgrade features Before the event financial media raised the bar so high that a stock market failure for AAPL was not unlikely as is discussed below In contrast facts suggest that the iPhone and therefore Apple may in fact be on the verge of a major historic victory The disparity between the price action and the relative valuation of Apple NASDAQ AAPL on the one hand and the accelerating business of the iPhone on the other hand has gotten so extreme that an update of the case for this stock is appropriate Heres a typical way in which AAPL is covered in the media which shapes so much of the way investors and traders act From the WSJ this Tuesday came Apples Real Rival Isnt Google WSJ subscription required at link That title is OK now that Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL no longer markets handsets arguably Apples real rival is the other handset manufacturers most of which use some version of Googles Android OS Curb your enthusiasm for Apple Incs next iteration of the iPhone That statement isnt based on any technical insight or leaked photos from Asian suppliers Its battery life could triple Siri become sentient and its front and rear cameras deliver more megapixels than the Hubble Space Telescope Investors still would have to temper expectations What the new device wont be able to do is alter the laws of economics and gravity Although the first quarter of fiscal corresponds with the holiday shopping season Apple may see its slowest yearoveryear rise in iPhone unit sales ever And if the analyst consensus estimate compiled by FactSet holds true iPhone sales will enter terra incognita the following quarter by dropping for the first time compared with a year earlier When the WSJ reports this as part of leadin to the introduction of Apples nextgen iPhone its a strong sign that institutional and individual investors are thinking this way This opens up an unusual investment opportunity A stock that arguably should be trading at a market PE or higher is at a or so discount to its multinational largecap tech peers The opportunity here stems from recognizing that the article and therefore the mindset of Mr Market a known manicdepressive is wrong in its facts and more importantly off target in a more comprehensive sense Apples iPhone appears close to an historic victory that if achieved would reverberate in a big way throughout multiple related industries and would drive AAPLs share price much higher Dissecting the WSJs and much of the Streets bear case for AAPL The idea that investors need to temper expectations for the new iPhone is off target AAPL is back to where it was about a year ago despite beating EPS expectations every quarter since then Thats especially impressive because each beat led to increased expectations Thus expectations have already been tempered substantially The paragraph that contained the temper expectations phrase uses hyperbole that is normally used when describing a bubble stock It is saying that even if the iPhone s which as we know was introduced Wednesday as an evolutionary product had been an unbelievable unexpected breakthrough product AAPLs valuation is nonetheless so extreme that investors simply must temper expectations But AAPL was already at roughly X FY EPS net of distributable excess net cash as the time of the product intro When investors see this sort of language we may tend to want to take the opposite side of the trade Often a stock of a company that may see flattish sales of its flagship product is presented as a value story say this way At only X trailing EPS net of excess cash XYZ stock has already discounted more than a year or two of flat sales Yet investors have reason to look forward to growth down the road and given the companys cash hoard and brand recognition Upside opportunity or at least a margin of safety beckons when a cheap stock is nonetheless presented so negatively in the financial press So even if the bull case that I propound below does not really work out AAPL has a clear margin of safety that in my view few stocks have anymore no matter that the market NYSEARCA SPY is off its high a bit Finally and as a leadin to my updated argument the WSJ is incorrect a product such as the iPhone that has a minority market share violates no laws of economics or gravity if it gains market share The computer industry is littered with large shifts in market share IBM NYSE IBM did not begin as in mainframes but then gained share and ended up as a monopoly Other companies gained share only to lose it However theres actually a strong bull case for the iPhone that recent news suggests may show that a turnaround for AAPL may loom The iPhone is close to a de facto monopoly due to its dominance of industry profits The iPhone is welldocumented by various companies such as Kantar and ComScore to have been gaining market share almost in every region of the world ever since Apple introduced the largerscreened iPhone and Plus That the iPhone has been gaining share even in Androiddominant Western Europe is impressive as are its massive share gains in Greater China in a stagnant market Given the cost efficiencies with the s series of iPhones as part of Apples ticktock approach to this product and the various software and hardware improvements in the s there is no reason to think that the trajectory of market share gains will be derailed This assumes that the new D Touch feature works well Even yoy stability in iPhone sales could well lead to some operating profit gains due to manufacturing efficiency improvements While market share gains are nice its possible to buy them at the expense of profits which is how the business world really works New Agetype stocks notwithstanding A toMac story discussed the profits story in July re the iPhone Android may have the market share but its an entirely different story when it comes to profit share the latest estimates from Canaccord Genuity indicate that Apple takes of the profits for the entire smartphone industry despite accounting for only of sales Samsung OTCSSNLF took a further of the profits and if you were wondering how that rather odd math works its because most of the other players make a loss so the two companies make more profit between them than the smartphone industry as whole Canaccord CEO Mike Walkley said that at the time Apple first entered the smartphone market in Nokia was taking around twothirds of the profits a far cry from today By the profit split was around between Apple and Samsung Since then he said the highend tier has really shifted away from Samsung to Apple Apples share of smartphone profits is up from a year ago though very slightly down on its share in the holiday season None of us can vouch for the precision of these numbers but I will assume they are more or less accurate Nontrivially they ignore profits that Google reaps from the knowledge it gains from Android usage as well as direct and indirect sales it gets from Android but they also ignore direct and indirect sales Apple gets from the iPhone so Ill accept them as valid The key implication of the above is this As soon as Apple saw the light and gave up its idee fixe that the iPhone could be no larger than in its diagonal dimension it immediately and without delay sucked up almost the entirety of all profits of the current machine that is changing the world The next question is that it takes a specific company to beat Apple Google tried and failed finally selling the Moto brand it acquired only a few years earlier Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY is nearly irrelevant and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has written off all of its B acquisition of Nokias NYSE NOK phone division Of course there are some credible smaller players such as Sony NYSE SNE but except for Samsung the only real threat to the iPhone come from the ultralowmargined Xiaomi and other Chinese manufacturers But without much profitability this sort of company cannot innovate and tends to end up trapped as a bottomfeeder Thus the profits race comes down for now to how much staying power Samsung has Samsung Electronics is a cog in the wheel of the parent chaebol and the chaebol has numerous challenges both in its semiconductor divisions and in its various heavy industries given economic challenges in South Korea where exports are plunging We have an updated answer about whether Samsung Electronics can really keep up its estimated profit share of the smartphone market The answer looks like No Heres why from Bloomberg News this Monday Samsung to Cut of Head Office Staff Economic Daily Says Samsung Electronics Co is preparing to cut percent of workers at its headquarters according to a Korean newspaper as the worlds biggest smartphone maker loses sales to Apple Inc and Chinese vendors Samsung is targeting workers in the human resources public relations and finance departments Korea Economic Daily reported Tuesday citing people it didnt identify The Suwon South Koreabased company also plans to cut some expenses next year the report added The moves come after new highend Galaxy smartphones failed to impress consumers triggering five straight monthly declines and wiping out more than billion in Samsungs market value since April The companys share of global smartphone shipments fell more than percentage points in the second quarter and its no longer the top seller in China the worlds biggest mobilephone market Cutting jobs is the easiest way to control costs and Samsungs spending on mobile business could also be more tightly controlled said Chung Chang Won an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc in Seoul Samsungs preparing to tighten its belt as it isnt likely see rapid profit growth in the years to come Samsung tried to attract customers before this weeks product launch from Apple by advancing the release of new Galaxy models Yet that failed to ease market concerns about its secondhalf earnings This is what happens when a company knows it is losing Weakness begets weakness We have likely all either seen read the transcript of or in other ways learned about the updated iPhone s that is being introduced soon For purposes of the thesis of this article the only point I want to make is that the improvements provide reasons to purchase it and the price cut US pricing on the current iPhone simply adds to its attractiveness What this improved version means is that the iPhones trend of profit dominance within its industry can continue Lots of upgrades and switches to this size iPhone either the or s appear likely In either case assuming the profit data presented above are correct AAPL may be ready to earn more or less of all industry profits Lets quantify matters just a bit more It has been reported that Apple plans to produce a record number of iPhone S handsets this year aiming to top M units by the end of the year In other words either AAPL will or wont ship a lot more iPhones or more at all this fiscal year than next But the stock is being valued as if it is AAPL and not Samsung that is shrinking If Apple ships million iPhones that will be a rise of million iPhones from the prior Q hardly its slowest yearoveryear rise in iPhone unit sales ever as the WSJ article above suggested could occur On a percentage basis it would be about increase which is far more than the roughly unit sales increase from Q to Q I think this is a plausible scenario Only time can tell how the iPhone grows and more importantly how its profits grow both objectively and in relation to those of its competitors But one year of sales is not everything We have to consider that the iPhones installed base which Canaccord estimated at million exiting is nearly certain to grow substantially The iPhone installed base should be at least million exiting calendar and that number does not require million iPhones to be sold next fiscal year This number may reach of the total global smartphone installed base and is a growing percentage This is a huge and growing advantage to Apples consolidated sales and profits not just those from the iPhone This point of a growing percentage of the installed base of smartphones is just another way that the iPhone is putting relentless and increasing pressure on every competitor Given the high profile of AAPL its worth saying that Im not arguing the relative merits of the iPhone or AAPLs ecosystem just the financial and profit trends Sometimes a company just takes control and thats the way it is Lets examine a bit more the implications of Samsungs shrinkage and AAPLs potential further dominance of industry profits What happens next if the iPhone attains a profit monopoly in smartphones What if AAPL indeed sucks up essentially all the profits from smartphone manufacturing and retains that share of profits for at least a few years The financial and stock market implications of this could be gigantic The most obvious implication is that not only may Samsung retreat from the market but other companies may follow its lead This might lead to excess capacity amongst suppliers allowing AAPL even lower component costs faster supply times etc Then it would be likely that Apple would end up selling more units as the competition thins out especially at the high end of the market where the iPhone is positioned If Apple is really going to run the profits table in the most important consumer product of the st century its entire operations will strengthen It will sell many more apps and more Apple Watches More and more developers will work with Apple More and more companies will partner with it The MSFT appearance at Apples Wednesday event may have had some significance as might that of another historic rival Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Tim Cooks AAPL is one that has now created deals with IBM Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and numerous smaller companies This dealmaking may just be getting going That may have been the unstated point of the company doing a deal with its former rival IBM and now bringing MSFT and ADBE onstage unnecessarily to talk about apps for what will be a niche product the iPad Pro AAPLs subset of the world of computing may be consolidating around it not completely but enough to allow investors to project faster and more certain profit growth than they now do All this potentiality plus great current value makes AAPL an exceptional opportunity But unless trends reverse a lot AAPL looks like a relatively safe stock not that any stock is really safe AAPL is currently providing its shareholders with about an free cash flow yield based on historical reported inthebooks EPS Leaving aside the above bull hypothesis on smartphones or other aspects of Apples business all AAPL has to do is grow FCF by an historically average a year for the next years to provide longterm patient shareholders with a FCF yield in Compare that to yields available from year corporate bonds and one has to conclude that simply on a cashoncash basis AAPL is attractive Then in addition to the cash returns there will probably be substantial share price appreciation by even under these modest assumptions No guarantees exist but the odds appear favorable for AAPL longs relative to cash fixed income or other stocks that mostly have higher PEs and lack AAPLs many advantages The WSJ presented a reasonable version of the bear case on AAPL ie that its flagship iPhone line which accounts for most of its profits may be about to show yoy unit sales decline However I would argue that even if this occurs it might simply reflect global economic distress which would hurt AAPLs competitors more than it And if so then theres always the iPhone to look forward to The bigger point is that smartphones are a growing albeit maturing industry The yetbigger key is that AAPL is improving its product line expanding into new geographies India and the iPhone is gaining market share almost everywhere in the world including Samsungs homeland In a base case taking the long view which is how a growthoriented stock needs to be viewed and valued there is no obvious reason not to expect any large strong company not to grow FCF at the rate of nominal GDP which may be in the annual range on a year basis If thats the case then mathematically AAPL could simply be an average stock and because of its low valuation today end up as a fine buyandhold total return investment vehicle However evidence presented herein makes the bear argument look untimely AAPLs only other significantly profitable smartphone competitor Samsung is shrinking substantially This happens in a growing industry when profits are shrinking and are not expected to recover Thus a realistic possibility is that soon with a successful launch of the iPhone s with a presumablybetter iPhone just one year away the iPhone could achieve a de facto profit monopoly amongst all smartphone manufacturers while selling a minority of handsets The upside EPS profit and PE implications of this possibility could be extremely large and are not reflected in AAPLs share price Thus I remain markedly overweight in AAPL and have added to my position recently Disclosure I amwe
