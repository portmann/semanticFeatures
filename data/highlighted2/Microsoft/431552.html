been held down by its slower growth PC chip businesses forcing Intel to cut its FY guidance Intel announced in April that it would be undergoing restructuring initiatives to accelerate its evolution into a IoT and data center provider During an interview with the CEO of Intel NASDAQ INTC Brian Krzanich in April Jim Cramer hinted at the possibility of Intel breaking up into two companies Upon further research and analysis Intels potential corporate spinoff carries both key advantages and synergistic sacrifices Client computing is the companys PC microprocessor business consisting of its PC client group and mobile and communications group This segment accounts for of the firms revenue The CCG has reported falling earnings for the last fiscal year and disappointed again in the most recent quarter reporting Q The falling revenue growth can partially be contributed to the global slowdown in PC sales falling YoY Intel is actively trying to boost PC sales by partnering with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows however Windows failed to jump start PC sales The incredible cash cow that is Intels CCG department comes from the fact that it dominates the PC processor market with market share Data center includes Intels communication and connectivity businesses as well as security software and storage It has seen upwards of YoY growth with YoY growth in security software solutions Intel explained in its most recent report that growth in the data center and IoT segments make up for challenges in the PC segment IoT solutions is a segment consisting of platform and connectivity for enterprises and smart devices This is the fastest growth segment at YoY and is the primary growth driver of Intel Intel is beginning to i nvest heavily in its IoT and data center capabilities putting itself at a favorable position in comparison to competitors It maintains its client computing division as a stable source of cash to fuel its new product development efforts in IoT and data storagesecurity In this aspect the company itself is under great hands with Krzanich at the helm Unlike semiconductor counterparts SanDisk SNDK and Seagate NASDAQ STX Intel has made major progress toward leading the IoT trend Although Intel is positioned positively in the semiconductor landscape its stock price clearly does not reflect its positioning in IoT and data spaces This brings up the potential of a corporate spinoff The stock has been held down by its slower growth PC chip businesses forcing Intel to cut its FY guidance despite impressive growth in its other two segments As a result Intel is valued lower compared to competitors with greater exposure and company focus on IoT processors like Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO and Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX Broadcom carries a PE ratio of compared to Intels Its EVEBIT tells the same story at x vs Intels x Along the same vein Seagate and Western Digital are examples of companies that have not kept up with a rapidly growing IoT progression and suffer from lower valuation multiples more representative of Intels slower growth CCG division In addition a corporate breakup of Intels CCG in one and its IoT and data center divisions in another allow each segment greater operational focuses Intel announced in April that it would be undergoing restructuring initiatives to accelerate its evolution from a PC company to one that powers a network of connected devices From this announcement it is clear that Krzanich and Intel recognize the importance of making the transition quickly and are willing to make operational and large organizational changes to do so A corporate break up would be an extreme act that brings more risk but also greater possibility for returns Intels billion acquisition of Altera is an example of a major step toward connected devices by taking advantage of product synergies between the two companies in data center processors and IoT As Intel grows larger as a company it may become slower in making rapid product innovations and adjustments a disadvantage against smaller competitors like Broadcom In HP NYSE HP broke up into its flagship PC and printer business and HP Enterprise NYSE HPE focused on data center and IoT operations Similarly to Intel HP was a weathered large technology company that was effectively bogged down by its slower growth declining PC segment Upon separating this division from the new ventures of HP Enterprise Meg Whitman quickly narrowed the focus of HPE towardsgrowth and customer expansion HPE quickly made efforts in expanding its footprint in the cloud by partnering with Dropbox providing the company HP computers and releasing Dropbox Private DROPB from its prior reliance on AWS for customer data storage A corporate break up also comes with a flurry of risks and potential disadvantages Some of these risks include financing difficulties and the area of timing Intel primarily funds its product development efforts in IoT and data centers with the earnings from its PC processor business As a result of its commanding market share in PC the company has the extraordinary advantage of near bottomless cash sources Intel is still in the midst of realizing a lot of its synergies with Altera it could be difficult to manage both those operational adjustments as well as a corporate break up Timing is an issue that may determine when Intel believes it is best to undertake this challenge Likewise management of both new entities comes up as a significant risk Execution is key and even in the HP example we have yet to determine if the break up will yield significant strengths in the future Despite the common managerial financial and human capital risks of a corporate breakup Intel is in a unique position within semiconductors where it has the financial capabilities and strong management needed to successfully execute a break up Although timing and other risks must be weighed properly against the potential benefits of breaking up the possibility is certainly there for Krzanich and Intel Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article
