September quarter This has been attributed to the iPhone although Foxconn provides no specific data on its customers Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone supplier Foxconns AKA Hon Hai Precision Q financial results and monthly revenue reports indicate that iPhone sales are growing substantially yy by about This substantial growth rate belies Apples own guidance for the quarter and underscores the surprise factor awaiting investors when Apple reports its fiscal Q results in January Foxconn reported results on Monday with yy revenue growth of to billion and yy operating income growth of to billion Foxconn is known to be Apples principal supplier of iPhones and this prompted an article titled New iPhones lift Foxconn earnings in the Wall Street Journal also at the link at MarketWatch that pointed to iPhone as the reason for Foxconns earnings growth It was the kind of feel good article I would normally expect to find on one of the many Apple fan sites Exactly how much of the revenue boost was attributable to the iPhone The article doesnt say How many iPhones has Foxconn produced The article doesnt say The lack of information is understandable as Foxconn is very tight lipped about its customers Foxconns Q earnings report is about as minimalist as it gets Foxconn doesnt bother holding quarterly earnings conference calls What got me interested in Foxconn is that it reports its revenue on a monthly basis and has already reported its revenue for October I thought this could provide some advance insight into Apples iPhone sales if I could determine the relationship between Foxconns revenue and iPhones being ordered by Apple Unfortunately the relationship is not onetoone Foxconn is known to perform contract electronics assembly for many companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT However it turns out that Foxconns revenue minus a fixed amount of billion correlates fairly well with what I estimate to be Apples payment to Foxconn for the iPhones produced Apples cost was estimated from the gross margin Apple reported for a given quarter and Apples reported iPhone revenue for that quarter The chart below shows the results In effect the Foxconn revenue matches fairly well with only the assumption that revenue from all other sources is fixed at billion Of course this cant be perfectly true since theres some random variance between the Foxconn revenue and the Apple estimated iPhone cost The correlation gets stronger over time because the iPhone became a much larger percentage of Foxconns total revenue as iPhone sales grew in In the chart below I show my estimate of iPhone sales as a percentage of total Foxconn revenue Looking at Foxconns monthly revenue report provides a way to zoom in on Foxconn sales as well as get a sneak peek at the current quarter In the chart below I plot monthly revenue in US for and As you can see Foxconns revenue takes off as Apple launches a new iPhone in September Foxconn already beat last years revenue associated significantly with the iPhone Plus and is on a trajectory to surpass its December quarter revenue by about to billion If my estimate of last years iPhone revenue percentage for Q is applicable for this year then Foxconns iPhone revenue will be about billion Applying Apples typical gross margin of results in billion in iPhone revenue for Apple This is a yy increase of compared to calendar Q iPhone revenue of billion Of course theres a lot of uncertainty in the analysis The precise amount of noniPhone revenue clearly varies from quarter to quarter and cant be predicted with certainty My assumption of a fixed amount of billion per quarter amounts to an approximation However in the past year the first chart showed that this has been a conservative assumption as the percentage of iPhone revenue for Foxconn get larger Also investors will be able to watch Foxconns revenue on a monthly basis throughout the quarter for additional insight as to the direction of iPhone sales Its worth noting that UBS analyst Steve Milunovich has issued a prediction that closely agrees with the above result Milunovich has predicted that Apple will sell million iPhones in the December quarter for a unit growth yy of about Assuming the ASP of the September quarter of this works out to iPhone revenue of billion As we proceed through the quarter were starting to see more positive reporting about the iPhone such as Milunovichs prediction and the report from Canaccord Genuity that Apples share of smartphone industry profit had grown to as of calendar Q I expect well see more such reports as analysts converge on the approximately correct iPhone sales figure in the December quarter I expect the yy iPhone revenue gain to be fairly close in the end Combined with healthy sales of the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch I fully expect Apple to blow past the top end of its guidance yy revenue growth of We only use your contact details to
