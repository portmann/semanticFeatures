companys relationship with top marketers and agencies Carolyn oversees a team of regional leaders and the team is focused on global partnership global agencies and Facebooks creative shop Prior to join Facebook Carolyn was the Corporate Vice President of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Global Advertising Sales and trade marketing teams So Carolyn thanks for being here today Okay Before we get into the questions I am going to read Facebooks Safe Harbor statements So before we get started on behalf of Facebook Id like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this conversation Carolyn may make forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the business strategy or prospects of Facebook Facebook cautions you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements These risk factors are described under the caption Risk Factors in Facebooks quarterly report on Form Q filed with the SEC on November In addition please note that any forwardlooking statements that Carolyn makes are based on assumptions as of today and Facebook undertakes no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events So now we have that behind us Maybe Ill start big picture Carolyn I think one of the big questions that investors always have is what is the conversation like between Facebook its advertising partners as you sort of attempt to balance user engagement against your advertisers goals on Facebook more broadly So sort of maybe you could give us a state of where that conversation fits today between Facebook and your advertising partners Sure So I have been at Facebook for it will be five years in February and the conversation has evolved dramatically Five years ago advertisers and agencies had questions about whether or not Facebook ads worked and that was the first hurdle that we thought we needed to overcome Fastforward to today and the conversations really revolving around several topics Number one culture companies are trying to understand how they have to evolve their corporate culture to move more quickly to be more collaborative to innovate at a more rapid pace to think about talent retention in very new ways and actually a lot of my conversations today with marketers are to help them understand the Facebook culture and how that could adapt the companies that have been around for plus years Thats the first thing thats on every company every big companys mind So second is just a profound shift in mobile So if we think about mobile as in my opinion the most important transformation we have had in marketing in over years Radio took years to get to million people TV took years mobile has taken years to get to billion people We have never seen such a transformation and its not just that marketing needs to evolve because consumer behavior has shifted dramatically actually entire business model have to evolve If you were a company today starting a retail business or a financial services business in all likelihood you would be starting as a mobile first company And so mobile as a topic is at the CEO and Board level conversation that we are having with all of our companies So thats the second thing that they are thinking about So third is then more granular on advertising Advertising for decades used to be advertising at people We build factories We build brands by doing mass reach advertising and it worked very effectively for many many years Now that consumers have the most personal device they have ever had in the history of devices their expectation around marketing has changed dramatically The expectation is if you are going to show up on my phone which is very personal its my contacts its my app you need to show up in a relevant useful delightful manner And so really rethinking how data becomes a new currency for really strong creative is an area that we are advising clients quite a lot in And I think more broadly is a measurement challenge because if you think about what I said five years ago do Facebook ads worked now the measurement question is actually a lot of the measurement that the industry has been using for years is actually not working well in mobile because its been cookiesbased And cookies work in a desktop environment and yet the consumer behavior has shifted not only to mobile but to multidevice usage There is over million people that use mobile multiple devices a day and so using cookies is no longer an effective way of measuring effectiveness you need to go to peoplebased measurement and so all of the measurement challenges that companies are facing are very top of mind So thats how the conversations evolve I think right now its really about how do you utilize this drastic shift in consumer behavior to grow your business in a very different way than marketers have done for the last several decades So maybe I want to stay on that topic of measurement and attribution its something the Facebook team led by Sheryl talks a fair bit about to investors when you have your earnings call every quarter What is the state of measurement and attribution today What are the tools that advertisers want to see from Facebook Where are sort of the game going from a measurement and attribution standpoint Well the first and foremost is actually we are very principled about measurement We tell marketers and agencies that they should not spend a single dollar with us unless they believe we are driving their business outcome And thats a very I think its a very normal statement but apparently its a very unusual statement out there And the reason we believe that so strongly is that at the end of the day our job at Facebook is to grow our clients business be it a small business or its the worlds largest companies and we think we have very effective ways to measure the effectiveness of it and everything marketer should do should have a business outcome As opposed to social metrics which is where the industry was several years ago when companies were measuring things like likes share comments or followers we want to be held accountable for are we driving online conversations offline sales rend awareness lift so on and so forth So thats how we think about it from a principle standpoint In terms of where it is today we have invested in ad tech more broadly Atlas is really the core strategy that we are pursuing from a measurement standpoint And what Atlas does we bought it from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a couple of years ago We basically rebuilt it from scratch and we built it to be mobile first peoplebased and so that it would work effectively across device and not only work effectively across device it could be able to link offline measurement with online measurement to really drive lift and understand whether or not your campaign not only by the way on Facebook or Instagram but more broadly in the ecosystem How they actually driving lift So the two things that we are pursing very aggressively are this conversation lift which is basically now being used by about of our advertisers they have done about studies and it uses AB testing to determine whether or not the ads on Facebook and Instagram and other properties are driving lift or not Lift can be defined as online sales it could be defined as brand awareness or ad recalled but very clear AB experimental design is it being effective The other thing we are doing is we are asking advertisers to put a conversation pixel on so they can track the actual behavior of consumers across the devices Its very effective for understanding the consumer journey which often bounces back and forth between devices throughout the day and so thats the second product that we are doing Atlas right now is being tested and used by a number of marketers We are pleased with the progress Its still early days The industry has been using cookiebased measurement for over years And its going to take time to shift to be about peoplebased and about businessoutcome based So we think its incredibly important The other thing that were doing is being sensitive to measurement in emerging markets because we have here in a bit more developed market we have access to things like Nielsen and we have access to things like Datalogix to measure instore sales But if youre in an emerging market some of those capabilities dont exist And so we launched Mobile Polling as an example where a brand can get a very quick read on the device where the ads are actually being served whether or not its actually driving the result And so we do Mobile Polling now not only with Nielsen but with Millward Brown and thats being rightly used in emerging markets Okay I want to shift a little bit to the types of marketers and how they interact with Facebook And we start first with brand advertisers thats where use of the web with is Facebook in many ways is now talking to advertisers who have been around for years and big brands sort of fit in that category What is the state of brand advertising on Facebook and how has that changed over the last one to two years Well we have the privilege of working with all of the top brand marketers in the world And from that vantage point we see them at very different points of the journey We have major marketers that have been with us for over five years where we have very sophisticated global joint business plans and we are absolutely driving business outcomes for a very majority of their large brands We have other large marketers that are very early in their stage of understanding the digital transformation I think the biggest shift that Im seeing with brand marketing is that brands are actually brand to more traditional brand marketing is becoming more like DR Marketing And DR Advertisers are very interested in what brands are doing And there is a blurring of the two that are occurring So let me give you a very specific example If you are a CPG company if you are a Proctor Gamble or Unilever CocaCola Pepsi you name the company they are very focused on what is the future going to look like from an ecommerce perspective How am I going to be able to sell my products directly to the consumer So that is an area of strategic growth for them where are they going to learn and get inspiration from They are going to learn and get inspiration from the ecommerce companies and more of DRoriented companies Conversely we see a tremendous amount of investment being put into India and Greater China in particular for ecomm companies that want to learn how to become global brand because no longer when you build a company you just thinking about your consumers in a geographic radius Now you have access to consumers around the world and they are very interested in learning about brand So we feel lot of lines blurring between brands and DR advertising I will say from a more traditional brand perspective they have been very delighted with the innovations weve made on video Sight sound and motion has been a format that they have loved for many many years Of course its been what they use on TV very very effectively And with not only our autoplay video but all of the innovations that video and testing out video home and suggested videos they are definitely seeing an opportunity to tell their story in a mobile environment which is incredibly important to them I think the biggest surprise to me just in terms of as I think about mobile over the last years we talk about mobile advertising as always the shinning example of walking past the retailer getting back with an offer and it was going to be georelevant and you were going to walk into the store and get a discount Thats how everybody talks about it I think what we missed as an industry is actually mobile as the most important brand building platform now in the world because of the scale Every single day we now have over a billion people on our platform You cannot build a brand without taking advantage of mobile There is no choice and thats every category even the entertainment category We have the largest number of movie and TV fans aggregated in any one place And so even the entertainment business is looking at Facebook and Instagram as the source of building out their brand if they are launching a new show or a movie And so the importance of a mobile as a brand building platform I think we underestimated as an industry And were certainly seeing migration to that The other big opportunity that gets talked about a fair bit is small business You have million small business pages on Facebook against million advertisers today And the team talks a lot about closing the gap and sort of facilitating small business reaching their customers What is some of the hurdles What are some of the challenges that could lead to the opportunity of small business investing on Facebook being realized over the next couple of years Yes So there is certainly a gap between the number of business pages and the number of advertisers that we have today Were doing a number of things First and foremost we know that small business owners are on Facebook at a on a personal level And many there is still a high percentage of small businesses that dont even have a website presence And so Facebook pages actually are becoming their presence in the mobile environment and they are not having to invest in building out a full website in the desktop world So were definitely seeing that trends We try very hard to build selfserve tools for small businesses to be able to actually start to advertise in a very seamless and easy way The most the most used products for small businesses is actually just to boost the post which is a very simple thing If they are making a post about I mean offering a new product or service they literally can quicken with very very not a lot of effort They can actually add a little bit of a boost pay for that ad and see the accelerated reach and then we start to drive the business from there So we see a huge opportunity for us to grow I mean small businesses are incredibly important not only because our consumers are connected to them and want to hear from them We also see that on Instagram almost of people on Instagram which is now over million people on a monthly basis are connected to a business So consumers clearly want to connect with businesses and want to have a presence from them Were also seeing a very significant increase of X over the last year with a number of consumers that are communicating the businesses on Facebook pages Again what are the expectations The expectations from consumer these days are that they can interact with the business They have access to it be an email or a message and they are very much feeling like this is much more of a personal relationship that never has before And so our messaging between consumers and businesses has grown dramatically in the last year In June you launched a test around Buy Buttons You are expanding that now Maybe help us understand the social commerce concept The idea of Buy Buttons what are you seeing from out in the field from Buy Buttons and what does some of the decisions you have to make about going wider with that initiative So I think if we think about this holiday season and some of the best practices that were seeing marketers to really implement Number one is that conversion pixel is really understanding the behavior of consumers as they migrate between different places on the web and in the mobile environment The second product that has been very successful is dynamic product ads And so just to explain what dynamic product ads are you can take a lets say a retailer and they can upload their entire product catalog and then without having to create individual ads for millions of products with some of these obviously these retailers have millions of different product offering we can dynamically generate the right product and the right ad through the person at the time based on potentially somebody revisiting their shopping cart and they didnt purchase it when they were browsing for a particular product and its even is sophisticated as knowing that maybe you did buy it so make sure you dont show that product again because that would be a waste to that If you just purchase something why do you need to see an ad for that again And so dynamic product ads have been very very effective In addition we have this format called Carousel ads which basically show up to five images or video and it allows marketers to take a single product and show it in very unique ways over the course of five images You could show five different products You could tell a story You could show a couple of products with some new stories as background information for it So the combination of conversion pixel Dynamic Product ads and Carousel ads have been very very effective In terms of social commerce overall what we are really trying to do is actually facilitating easier shopping between consumers and businesses And mobile conversions historically have been challenging Think about what you have to do on the mobile phone You have to often enter in all of your information You have a screen thats much smaller You have to put in your credit card your address and it is cumbersome And so testing things like the buy button testing things like links comment pages for callstoaction testing link ads that automatically update your information and send it to a small business Those are all attempts on our part to really make the transaction easier between a consumer and a business It is clear that consumers discover products on Facebook from businesses from their friends It is also clear that they would like to be able to buy them in a much more simpler fashion and thats what we are trying to do Got it Okay One question thats come in through the Crowd Mics and I also wanted to talk about is international monetization You look at your results and you clearly are monetizing engagement to a much greater degree in North America Western Europe and then as you move out of more developed markets there seems like there is a huge opportunity around international monetization Maybe talk a little bit about what the companys doing to sort of address sort of that longterm opportunity Sure So I just got back from India I took my global leadership team to India Twice a year I take them to markets that are incredibly important for us from a culture emergence perspective to learn how the product has been used and also to understand the needs of the marketers And so this is a very important area for us So let me just start very broadly There is about of people connected to the Internet today That number differs a little bit depending on the source you use but its about which means there are over billion people that are still not connected to the Internet And one of the things that we are most focused on is actually providing connectivity to the people that dont have access We are doing that through a number of fronts We are doing that through a free basic services which is now available to million people that can access it and the notion there is to get them on to the Internet with free access to data around health education financial services and over time they then will use additional apps for doing things around satellite and we are launching an unmanned aircraft vehicle in early So we are very focused on trying to connect the rest of the world thats core to the mission of Facebook In terms of monetization we actually are seeing tremendous interest in those markets from our large global marketers So for example take India since I was just there last week India is the second largest market for Facebook outside of the United States has about a million people using the platform Yet in India of a population of billion people a billion people are still not connected to the Internet And so we are in a very early stages However what you are seeing in India is really two forms of really interesting growth You are seeing an explosion of ecommerce right India is very much they dont really allow traditional foreign direct investment for bigbox retailers There is ton of small business activity Ecommerce its almost like they skipped to years of what we did in terms of growing the retail business They have already moved to mobile commerce And we start with many of those companies last week and they are seeing tremendous growth Then you take the more traditional CPG companies and an auto companies and they are seeing a market like India as their future market to get the next billion consumers as they grow economically and they have access to more of these services And so we are definitely seeing a tremendous amount of interest in markets like that What we are doing on the monetization and product front is number one you have to recognize that the phones that we are all probably using and the tablets that we all have in front of us today we have pretty good connections thanks to ATT who are with us here and Verizon and others that have wired it for us But the majority of these markets are still living with G connections And so we have Facebook Lite which only uses one megapixel of data so its a very lightweight version of Facebook so that can be used in G connections We are allowing people to make a post when they are offline and then when they get to a WiFi environment it uploads From a marketing perspective we are taking our traditional video product which uses a lot of data and we now have something called Slideshow which CocaCola just used in both Nigeria and Kenya So they are basically able to show a video like product to more of a G feature phone connection We have clicked to missed call in India which is very common behavior that consumers literally click and their business calls them back so the consumer doesnt have to pay for data So its really being mindful of what the product needs are in those markets and being mindful of the connectivity challenges that consumers have as they build products and services that speak to that market So we are very focused on that Okay Just a reminder if you want to send questions to me up here on the stage please use the Crowd Mics app to please find your phone I have been getting a fair bit of questions around product and thats sort of where I wanted to go and that its been a really busy year for Facebook on products It almost seems like very few days go by before we see new iterations around product from the company One of the areas thats the most interesting to look from the outside is video both as a user on Facebook and what advertisers are trying to accomplish for video Can you talk about what sort of how the video ads advertising site is evolving Whats sort of the conversations like when advertisers just think about putting more money to work on video advertising on Facebook So today we have about billion video views a day and million people on Facebook watch at least video a day and that is growing very very quickly And its not surprising because there is an overarching trend in visual communication thats being particularly driven by a millennial audience that believe that they are living in a borderless world and they can communicate with people crossborder and language becomes a barrier and so we see a huge explosion in photo and video sharing that obviously is driving both Instagram and Facebook And so video overall is a very beloved way to communicate for consumers first and foremost And we really focus on making sure the consumer product and the consumer usage is delightful before we start thinking about how the ad products work into that because one of your earlier questions was how do you balance consumer engagement and ad At the end of the day we have to deliver a valuable product to consumers every single time you interact with your products and thats the first and most important thing that we do In terms of how marketers are thinking about video they are thinking about it in a number of different ways First of all the mobile environment is very different than their other environments they have used video before Often consumers are watching mobile video with sound off initially and when I speak with marketers and ask is that in your creative brief or you thinking about how do you subtitle hotelscom did a great one of the first marketers to it where they have this character called Captain Obvious and he was playing the piano and he pretended he was like an amazing piano player meanwhile he wasnt that great but it was all subtitle Why subtitles because if youre actually engaged with it you might be more incline to turn on the sound but sound off is a consideration The interaction and the actual results from the first one to three seconds are incredibly important in a mobile environment especially feed If you just think about the use of your thumb we call it thumb stopping content what is going to get a consumer to stop their thumb and actually engage in those first one to three seconds are really important whereas in other environment you tend to have longer to build the story arc so thats another consideration that were working with marketer is on In terms of length of video and how theyre thinking about it very few marketers are just picking up their second spots and putting them into the feed environment Theyre thinking much more thoughtfully about how to actually engage consumers and tell story sequentially So Macys for example during this holiday season is using both Facebook and Instagram Theyre teasing short very short videos around believe which is their its a great wonderful sort of holiday story about children being able to write their wish and having them come true They are very short videos that theyre teasing and as they find consumers engaging with them then they are going to leas to a much longer three minute version of the film We have the ability because of peoplebased marketing to start something on your mobile device in the morning If you engage with it we can then send something back to you on your desktop if youre at desktop during the day If youre at home at night and you happen to be on a tablet we can then send something else so the notion of building sequential story telling and video is something thats very very appealing to marketers So I would say were in the early days of video Its a beloved medium Consumers are clearly clamoring for it and using it more and more and it was really a major inflection point by the way in August of with the ice bucket challenge When million people around the world were consuming an ice bucket video and uploading it and engaging that almost topped the world how easy it was to actually shoot a video and upload it and from then on we saw a tremendous growth And what does that mean for what video ad budgets and how they might be how that might change the narrative around video ad budgets being deployed on Facebook around video Great So one of the biggest questions is there still a significant amount of budgets that still are spent in the TV environment And when you look at the TV advertising budgets versus mobile there is still a wide discrepancy Mobile is of consumers time Its roughly of budgets TV has a very significant amount of marketers budget And so what we were trying to figure out was we knew that mobile video particularly Facebook and Instagram were very addictive to the TV reach story For example with Millennials we add about incremental reach as an example And we also know that reach is becoming more and more challenging in the TV environment as the ratings have become more challenging outside of live event But yet there is a whole history of how agencies and marketers have bought TV Theyve bought it based on TRPs total rating points Theyve bought it using processes and systems that have existed for decades And so we have two choices we could say look time to completely shift and you got to use all of these new tools or we could build them in onramp to the future and say tell us what your total rating point objective is Lets combine it with what youre doing on TV at Facebook and Instagram will be coming in early to the mix And we made it much easier for the agency and marketers to actually combine their TV and Facebook and Instagram buy The reaction has been positive Its still early We only launch in September But its very much to be sort of a bridge to the future of where we think the marketer needs to go Okay Youve referenced Instagram a few times I know its front of mind for investors also Earlier this year you expanded the ability to advertise on Instagram Maybe help us understand what the longterm plan is with respect to Instagram what the early days have shown you about how advertisers are putting money to work on Instagram or what thats doing for broader advertising budgets Sure So Instagram now is available globally as of September It has over million people using the platform It is growing incredibly quickly from a usergrowth perspective And marketers were very eager to be able to do more on Instagram And why is that when we take Facebook and Instagram you have the two most important mobile ad platforms in the world in the majority of markets And so if youre a marketer again and you have to reach people you have to reach the most certain frequency You have to engage with relevant content Instagram and Facebook are very very powerful combined There are differences between how the two platforms are utilized Instagram is a place for visual inspiration About of the people are following businesses So there is definitely an interest but there is also a high percentage of people that follow people they dont know and that is because theyre inspired by whatever they happen to be posting about I follow a lot of people that post about dogs because I have four of them and I happen to like that Whereas on Facebook you are connected to people you know or have at least some degree of separations but theyre in your network So the use cases are a little bit different But what we did do and it was really important I think for us to do this in the last time I did in an investor meeting a number of months ago we had not really built this yet As we took the back of all of the ad infrastructure of Facebook so all of the targeting capabilities and measurement capability is the selfserved The ATI working with Facebook marketing partners to accelerate and to be able to have our partner sell Instagram We took all of the infrastructure that we have built for Facebook and made it available on Instagram And so now marketers can basically get the same level of targeting and measurement that they were used to on Facebook And frankly once you built that for Facebook it sort of starts to become table stakes right Marketers expect the ability to use those targeting capabilities and the measurement And so were seeing a lot of interplay between the two platforms these days As I mentioned and I referenced Macys has done some fabulous work between the two platforms for the holiday season as has Target with their Cartwheel app And you can actually interplay the two So as I said with the Macys example they used the marquee on Instagram which basically is something that you get the dominant share of the advertising on Instagram for the day that you use it So they used it before right before Black Friday Based on who interacted with that they then could retarget them not only on Instagram but also on Facebook So we are seeing a lot of interplay between the two and again marketers are very excited to have two incredible platforms While referencing the interplay between the two is interesting Sheryl Sandberg on last earnings call mentioned that some of the advertising dollars that were getting put to work on Instagram were incremental to Facebook Inc And somewhat and maybe you could tease that out help investors understand the interplay of how ad dollars are being put to work between Instagram Facebook and how that might evolve going forward Yes So we are still saying that There is nothing changed from what Sheryl said back in earnings call What were seeing right now is that marketers are increasing their share of budget to the Facebook family They are trying to understand how much should be weighted for the Facebook and Instagram Some are saying lets take what weve done with Facebook pull a little bit of that off of Facebook test it on Instagram And yes remember we are in the early early days of Instagram right We have been very I think thoughtful about how we pulled out advertising Its just been rolled out globally over the last couple of months And marketers want to test each platform for the benefit of each platform and want to understand what actually works on Instagram before they necessarily decide to accelerate The same token we have marketers particularly in certain categories like the fashion category that have been waiting for Instagram to open up and are doing more on Instagram initially than they are on Facebook And so were really learning between the two overtime what we want both platforms to be are the most important growth drivers for businesses small to large And we are going to keep innovating on the products to make sure we get there One of the things you referenced earlier was the Atlas transaction Youve talked a lot about targeting capabilities two other pivots youve made at the backend on advertising was to acquire LiveRail And also launch the Facebook Audience Network If you talk a little bit about what those assets do for Facebook broadly when marketers think about putting the money to work both on Facebook and off Facebook So the strategy behind our ad tech investments is very much driven by our belief in where marketing is going in the future which is personalize marketing at scale So we want every time that person experiences an ad on Facebook and Instagram for them to feel like this is most relevant ad at exactly the right time and it was the most useful thing that could be served up to them right Because the more we do that the better the experience is the more they come back to the platform and they feel that the advertising is addictive So thats the core of what we believe We also believe that digital advertising and mobile advertising in particular needs to be improved across the ecosystem It needs to drive better results It needs to be more relevant for consumers So this is not something you need to Facebook and Instagram We think all platforms actually can benefit from better relevant more personalized marketing And so audience network has seen some really great success It of course add supply to our overall auction and allows marketers that are not only doing great things on Facebook and Instagram but to be able to access thirdparty app used native ads speed is driving very very effective ROI for our clients LiveRail has over accuracy in age and gender targeting compared to the industry average of to So LiveRail again utilizing the Facebook data around age and gender is a much more effective in its targeting And again we are trying to solve what we think are industry challenges One industry challenge is cookies completely overestimate reach and underestimate frequency And marketers are very surprised when we show them their reports of their cookiebased measurement and peoplebased measurement They think theyre reaching women to and they find out well Im actually reaching a lot of men that are and above and thats like a shock to the system when that happens And so we are trying to solve more accurate targeting and more relevant messaging both on our platform as well as off Got it So as we wrap up maybe just one last broad question You led with talking about mobile We were at the advertising forecasting panel here yesterday They talked about another big year for mobile When you think out to and you talk to most of the big players in advertising and marketing how are they thinking about mobile in and what are the big objectives either for mobile or outside of mobile that marketers are trying to accomplish in Mobile is again by far in a way the most important development in marketing that we will I think see in our careers You take every category thats been impacted So take the political election To date we have had million people interact on election topics little over billion interactions just through November is the last data point that I received Every member of Congress is on Facebook Every candidate is on Ben Carson has already come up with different ads He answers questions on Facebook every night This will be a mobile election so starting there Travel industry estimates that there will be more bookings on mobile than in So all of the travel clients that we are taking to are trying to understand that shift I can literally go vertical by vertical And so this is a change we believe we dont even talk about the shift is happening we believe the shift has happened And now its a question of how companies are going to change their internal prophecies adapt to the fact that this is now more consumers are spending more time in mobile than on TV And that just happened in the last few months So they are spending more time in mobile app So this is a profound shift It changes marketing and it changes business model And I think we are going to continue to talk about it for the next two years Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha However we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists and are excited to contribute
