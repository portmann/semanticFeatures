<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was able to claim growth in Surface revenue yy Claims of Microsofts ascendancy in tablets ignore the fact that iPad outsells Surface by A recent SA article on Microsofts earnings release pointed to the stark contrast between the iPad sales trend and that of Surface The percent gain for Surface was primarily due to terrible prior year sales performance The trend in iPad will likely be reversed by the forthcoming release of iOS and the iPad Pro A recent article by SA contributor LF Capital Management on Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT fiscal Q earnings results painted a bleak picture of Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPad compared to Surface Surface sales grew starkly contrasting Apples poor iPad performance MRQ The difference between consumer demand for the Surface vs the iPad in the tablet market only continues to widen I found this statement a little curious since I knew that iPad sales revenue was still quite a bit higher than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported for Surface revenue for the June quarter I decided to assemble some data comparing iPad and Surface sales for as far back as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been reporting Surface revenue which I believe is calendar Q of The chart below summarizes the data The downward trend allowing for seasonality of iPad sales is very visible but also apparent is the fact that Surface sales are not really growing explosively as the yy comp would imply In the year ago quarter Surface sales were a paltry million The slight bumps in Surface sales have corresponded to the introduction of new generations of Surface In Q it was the new Surface and Surface Pro In Q it was the introduction of the Surface Pro In Q it was the new Surface The introduction of new Surface models has made for terrific yy comparisons but hasnt really moved the needle very much for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>with peak revenues tending to stay around billion Quarters following the new Surface release have tended to see very large sequential declines as demand for the new models quickly wanes The real stark contrast continues to be between iPad revenue and Surface revenue The quote above should really be corrected to read The difference between consumer demand for Surface vs the iPad continues to narrow I have for some time been pointing to the root cause of iPads decline which is the tablet processor giveaway that Intel has been embarked on under the euphemism of contra revenue Contra revenue not only provided subsidies of Intels tablet processors but actually yielded a net negative revenue for the Mobile and Communications Group in Q By all appearances contra revenue continues at Intel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has not benefited particularly from contra revenue since Surface Pro used Core series processors which werent subsidized Most of the tablet processors Intel gave away last year went into Android and Windows devices made by companies other than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Microsofts recent switch of the Surface series from ARM to Intel Cherry Trail will also probably not be subsidized so I dont expect a big change in market share for Surface However Apple has needed to do more to counteract Intels moves and reverse the trend in iPad sales This will probably happen this year as Apple rolls out iOS and new iPad models iOS features split screen multitasking which will be available on iPad Air and any new model iPad Apple rolls out this Fall Apples version of split screen is much easier to use than the approach <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>developed for Win and is certainly competitive with Win Split screen multitasking and the even cooler video picture in picture feature of iOS definitely close an important gap that has existed between iOS and Windows tablets Also Apple will introduce its next generation systems on chip usually referred to as the A series that will be even faster than Apples current bit A series These will be fabricated initially on Samsungs nm FinFET node and so will have improved power efficiency Ive observed that the AX in the iPad Air delivered comparable performance on Geek Bench to the Core M in the new MacBook with Retina Display Of course benchmarks arent everything but I expect the next generation A series to do even better And the next iPad generation will probably get an enhanced AX that will also perform better in graphics than the A iPhone version The iPad Pro is almost certain to make its appearance by the Fall The iPad Pro will address pent up demand for a larger class tablet just as the iPhone addressed pent up demand for a larger screen iPhone Once the Pro is available I expect demand to exceed supply through the December quarter Apples new tablet products should at least temporarily widen the gap between iPad and Surface unit sales and revenue but competition is intense Ive previously observed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is on the right track in pursuing a converged OS approach for personal computers whether tablet laptop or desktop I still believe this is the right approach iPad will always seem a little light weight and less professional than Windows tablets and convertibles For that reason I expect competition between Surface and iPad to be intense The Surface Pro is a great device and will probably garner more share in the corporate world than iPad Pro could ever hope to do At least until Apple changes its tune on the issue of convergence Source Apple The Stark Contrast Between iPad And Surface Sales Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI
