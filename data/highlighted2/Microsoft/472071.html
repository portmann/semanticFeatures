driving force behind its solid quarterly performance in the fourth quarter of its fiscal The company continues to grab market share on all ends of the enterprise spectrum Microsofts transition from a traditional software sales model to a cloudfocused model flush with recurring revenue potential continues to show solid momentum Lets take a look at the firms investment highlights as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares as well as evaluate its dividend Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Intelligent Cloud segment was the driving force behind its solid quarterly performance in the fourth quarter of its fiscal and its commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded billion in the quarter putting it on track to achieve its goal of billion in annualized revenue by Revenue from Azure its enterprise cloud platform that provides businesses with cloudbased supercomputing power doubled in the quarter on a yearoveryear basis as did the compute usage of the platform more customers are buying the platform The period marked the eighth consecutive quarter in which Azure premium services revenue at least doubled Customers of Microsofts Enterprise Mobilitya mobility solution designed to help manage and protect users devices apps and data for businessesnearly doubled from the yearago period and its installed base is almost times as large as it was at this time last year In addition to the recurring revenue potential in its Intelligent Cloud segment Microsofts commercial version of Office its clouddistributed subscriptionbased productivity suitecontinues to drive growth in its Productivity and Business Processes segment Office commercial revenue leapt in the quarter on a yearoveryear basis and Office consumer products and cloud services grew The company continues to grab market share on all ends of the enterprise spectrum evidence of which ranges from its month streak of adding at least small and medium business customers or GE NYSE GE adopting its cloud for its new Internet of Things approach Nearly of Fortune corporations use at least three of Microsofts cloud offerings and the scale associated with working with such large companies brings an attractive highermargin aspect to the agreements Cannibalization by its cloud business has been a key component of bearish arguments against Microsofts business transition but management is quick to point out that its cloud services are doing things for companies particularly the larger enterprises that its servers could never do Microsofts transition from a traditional software sales model to a cloudfocused model flush with recurring revenue potential continues to show solid momentum Subscription trends and growth in installed bases across its cloudbased enterpriseserving platforms have been strong despite lumpy GAAP results in recent quarters and we like what such growth means for visibility into the firms future revenue stream Its contractednotbilled balance exceeded billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and commercial unearned revenue advanced on a constantcurrency basis from the yearago period Bottomline pressure may persist in the near termnonGAAP operating income fell on an asreported basis in the fiscal fourth quarter of from the same period in fiscal due to ongoing strategic investments aimed at driving cloudbased revenues but we expect such investments to pay dividends for the firm in the long run Microsofts products include operating systems server applications desktop and server management tools software development tools video games and online advertising Its hardware devices include the Surface and the Xbox One gaming and entertainment console One of its biggest assets is its cash on the balance sheet which stands at billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cant scoop up its own shares fast enough through its massive buyback program The firm floats debt with the best credit quality Aaa and we cant think of another firm with a better financial profile Financial discipline and strong execution remain hallmarks of its business Investors continue to focus on Microsofts Windows business because it has been the breadandbutter of the company for such a long time but we think the companys other segments are underappreciated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a core holding in the Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio and we think it continues to provide investors with a fantastic dividend growth opportunity Contrary to popular belief <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is not a tech dinosaur CEO Satya Nadella has reignited innovation in the company recently noting that customer excitement for new devices Windows Office and Azure is increasing However were not fans of the firms decision to acquire professional networking firm LinkedIn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>recent agreed to acquire LinkedIn NYSE LNKD for over billion in cash The deal is expected to be dilutive to EPS in fiscal and Our fair value estimate has been reduced as a result of the negative impact on earnings and additional debt to be taken on In our opinion the best measure of a firms ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firms economic profit spread Microsofts year historical return on invested capital without goodwill is which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of As such we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT In the chart below we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome in our opinion and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate Firms that generate a free cash flow margin free cash flow divided by total revenue above are usually considered cash cows Microsofts free cash flow margin has averaged about during the past years As such we think the firms cash flow generation is relatively STRONG The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow FCFF which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cash flow from operations increased about from levels registered two years ago while capital expenditures expanded about over the same time period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was once one of our favorite dividend growth ideas but the recent deal with LinkedIn has the potential to mitigate its dividend prospects Predeal it registers a strong Dividend Cushion ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has had one of the most attractive dividend growth profiles across our coverage universe It boasts an impressive balance sheet with a net cash position of billion as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal not inclusive of billion in longterm investments The firm has been painting its recent agreement to acquire LinkedIn for billion in a positive light highlighting the expansion of its addressable market and the potential to drive engagement across LinkedIn and Office as a result of the deal but we arent fond of what it will do for Microsofts future dividend potential For the time being however the firms Dividend Cushion ratio remains strong thanks to its balance sheet and strong free cash flow generating ability We think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has thrown away more than billion in cash in the form of shareholder capital that could have potentially gone toward one of the best future dividend growth streaks in history at a large Internetbased acquisition such as LinkedIn Synergies of the deal may be limited and we are not fond of the firm financing the transaction primarily through the issuance of new debt as it seeks to complete its billion share buyback program by the end of Were not fans of such a massive buyback program either due to our current opinion of the firms valuation profile While dividend increases may very well continue we think Microsofts dividend growth potential took a major hit with the LinkedIn acquisition We think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is worth per share with a fair value range of The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them Our nearterm operating forecasts including revenue and earnings do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of during the next five years a pace that is lower than the firms year historical compound annual growth rate of Our model reflects a year projected average operating margin of which is above Microsofts trailing year average Beyond year we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of for the next years and in perpetuity For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>we use a weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows Although we estimate the firms fair value at about per share every company has a range of probable fair values thats created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers like future revenue or earnings for example After all if the future were known with certainty we wouldnt see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock In the graph above we show this probable range of fair values for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>We think the firm is attractive below per share the green line but quite expensive above per share the red line The prices that fall along the yellow line which includes our fair value estimate represent a reasonable valuation for the firm in our opinion We estimate Microsofts fair value at this point in time to be about per share As time passes however companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends The chart above compares the firms current share price with the path of Microsofts expected equity value per share over the next three years assuming our longterm projections prove accurate The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year represents our best estimate of the value of the firms shares three years hence This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time should our views on the firms future cash flow potential change The expected fair value of per share in Year represents our existing fair value per share of increased at an annual rate of the firms cost of equity less its dividend yield The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value
