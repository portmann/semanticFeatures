class='textDiv'>The identity crisis that led to Yahoos demise Reuters SAN FRANCISCO By Jonathan Weber and Jeffrey Dastin A Yahoo logo is seen on top of the building where they have offices in New York City US July A combination photo shows Yahoo logo in Rolle Switzerland top in and a Verizon sign at a retail store in San Diego California US In SAN FRANCISCO When senior Yahoo executives gathered at a San Jose hotel for a management retreat in the spring of there was no outward sign of a company in crisis The internet pioneer not yet a teenager had just finished the prior year with billion in profits on billion in revenue The tough days of the dotcom bust were a distant memory and Yahoo Inc flush with lucrative advertising deals from the worlds biggest brands was enjoying its run as one of the top dogs in the worlds hottest industry But for one retreat exercise everyone was asked to say what word came to mind when a company name was mentioned They went through the list eBay auctions Google search Intel microprocessors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows Then they were asked to write down their answer for Yahoo It was all over the map recalled Brad Garlinghouse then a Yahoo senior vice president and now COO of payment settlement startup Ripple Labs Some people said mail Some people said news Some people said search While some executives said this was a useful management exercise that took place multiple times over the years it proved an ominous portent of the business troubles to come Indeed the demise of Yahoo which culminated in an agreement this week to sell the companys core assets to Verizon Communications Inc has been more than a decade in the making Many of the more than two dozen former Yahoo managers interviewed by Reuters over the past two weeks who now occupy executives suites elsewhere in Silicon Valley agree that the companys downfall can be traced to choices made by both the executive leadership and the board of directors during the companys heyday in the mids Some of the missed opportunities are obvious a failed bid to buy Facebook Inc for billion in A dalliance with Google similarly came to naught A chance to acquire YouTube came and went Skype was snapped up by eBay Inc And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corps nearly billion takeover bid for all of Yahoo in was blocked by Yahoos leadership Just as damaging as the missed deals though was a company culture that ultimately became too bureaucratic and too focused on traditional brand advertising to prosper in a fastmoving tech business according to some of the former Yahoo managers Reuters spoke with It became very difficult to get both investment and alignment around new product initiatives said Greg Cohn a former senior product director at Yahoo and now CEO of the mobile phone app company Burner If you built a new product and the home page didnt want to feature it you were hosed Worst of all once Alphabet Incs Google had displaced it as peoples first stop for finding something on the internet Yahoo was never able to decide on exactly what it wanted to be Yahoo today has more than billion users and has focused on mobile under chief executive Marissa Mayer who told Reuters in an interview Monday that she still saw a path to growth for Yahoo which the Verizon merger accelerated Yahoo will continue to operate as a holding company for its large stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan which are worth far more than the core business The appointment of Terry Semel who had completed a highly successful run as chairman of the Warner Bros movie studio as CEO in seemed to answer a question that bedeviled many early internet firms was it a tech company or a media company Semel could not be reached for comment on his Yahoo tenure But the focus on media proved lucrative in the short term as big advertisers desperate to get on board with the next big thing flocked to one of the largest properties on the web Revenue soared from million in to nearly billion by Indeed Semel and the media executives he brought in by all accounts turned a scrappy young internet startup into a highly profitable company that brought oldline advertising to a new medium From our perspective we were a media company said Dan Rosensweig Yahoos COO from to and now CEO of online education company Chegg Inc It didnt feel at the time that there was a strong likelihood we would beat Google at search Nobody could argue that we werent the largest front page on the internet Yahoo placed its signature purple everywhere then on cookies and cupcakes on the carpets and even in the martinis When Coca Cola came to campus we rolled out the purple carpet recalled Wenda Harris Millard Yahoos chief sales officer from to and now president and COO of business development firm MediaLink Millard said all the major advertisers from Coke to General Motors wanted to come to Yahoos campus at least once a year But the excitement and the revenue associated with the big advertising deals ten years ago turned out to be a trap in many ways Like its brethren in the print media business who continued to rely on selling ad pages long after it was clear that it was a dying business Yahoo couldnt help but to focus on where the big money was even though that wasnt where the future was The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they didnt take programming seriously enough wrote Paul Graham cofounder of the YCombinator tech incubator who sold a startup to Yahoo in a blog post about the companys woes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>back in the day Google and Facebook have all had hackercentric cultures But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity The downside of the media orientation became more clear as the s wore on In Yahoo acquired Overture the company that essentially invented the adsearch technology that made Google rich But Yahoo never succeeded in creating a strong competitor to Googles AdWords and AdSense systems A subsequent hugely expensive effort to rebuild its search and advertising technology dubbed Panama similarly bore little fruit Meanwhile marketleading products like Yahoo Mail and early social media efforts like Yahoo Groups were neglected as managers wrestled over which products would get priority on the hugely valuable Yahoo home page according to three former executives Promising acquisitions including photosharing site Flickr and social bookmarking service Delicious withered on the vine Former staffers say they were consumed with endless internal meetings and shifting priorities Former senior product director Cohn recalls how efforts to make Yahoo an open platform with nifty thirdparty applications around specific content areas such as travel foundered in the face of opposition from managers in charge of Yahoos inhouse products Too often the end result was money spread too thinly across too many marginal initiatives as Garlinghouse famously pointed out in a leaked internal document known as the Peanut Butter Manifesto By it was becoming clear that Yahoo was losing ground fast on the product side as Google solidified its hold on search New players like Facebook and Netflix Inc continued to arrive and steal Yahoos thunder Semel left that year in favor of cofounder Jerry Yang Whatever plans Yang may have had were quickly disrupted by the unsolicited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>takeover bid in early The offer split the management team Garlinghouse and others say and those divisions persisted even after Microsofts offer was beaten back Yang who championed the resistance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stepped down again in Three other CEOs followed before Mayer was appointed in The leadership turmoil made for a difficult existence for a board a management team and a general employee population to get committed to the same goal said Rosensweig Yang did not respond to requests for comment By the time Mayer arrived Yahoo was already seen in Silicon Valley as a company from another era It had lots of cash but few strategic advantages as it fought far larger competitors Many analysts and shareholder say Mayer exacerbated the troubles with acquisitions and key hires that proved misguided Mayer put a brave face on the deal Monday saying the scale that will result from the Verizon combination will enable it to continue its efforts to catch up in mobile social and advertising technology But the history of the tech business where companies rarely dominate from one generation to the next suggests that any such revival is a tall order Reuters News Agency Brand Attribution Guidelines Delivery Options Reuters is the
