class='textDiv'>A Big Bite Of The Apple Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha We believe that the investmentgrade universe has an adequate capital structure that balances shareholders and debtholders suggesting the credit cycle is in the middle of the expansion stage While Apples rise in debt has significantly outpaced its earnings growth this is an appropriate capital structure for a maturing company We are concerned about anemic investment and topline growth but corporate America has tremendous operating leverage following six years of thoughtful expense reduction Last week we highlighted CSX NYSE CSX managements decision to debt finance the increase in its share buyback program noting that the railroad was one of the first oldline industrial companies to embark on this strategy The descriptor oldline was purposeful as the new breed of investment grade corporate bond issuers began instituting debtfinanced share buyback programs two years earlier As the business models of technology companies such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Oracle NYSE ORCL matured and began to generate sustainable free cash flow introducing debt into the capital structure became reasonable In May Apple issued its first publicly traded corporate bonds following the announcement of twoyear billion buyback program In total the company earmarked billion in shareholder returns through Fast forward to last weeks fiscalsecondquarter announcement where the company boosted its return to shareholders through to billion billion in buybacks and billion in dividends That staggering sum is a increase over the companys prior plan Apples earnings were front page news in the next days The Wall Street Journal but it took until the second page and eight paragraphs for the Journal to lend some perspective The return to shareholders is larger than the market capitalization of all but of the members of the SP Index Is this another signal that the downturn stage of the credit cycle is approaching Since the growth in Apples debt e has outpaced that of its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization EBITDA by a significant amount ultimately increasing over billion by yearend Exhibit Sources Company financials Columbia Threadneedle estimates While Apples debt has grown rapidly the companys leverage metric debtEBITDA is still well below that of its technology and Industrial peers Exhibit So while the headline shareholder amount is a bit mind numbing Apples ability to generate earnings and ultimately cash estimated to be billion at fiscal yearend supports a significant increase in debt in its capital structure As CEO Tim Cook stated on the companys earnings call Were in the very fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and keep making these important investments So today were announcing another significant update to our capital return program expanding its size to billion through March of Sources Company financials Columbia Threadneedle estimates We believe that the investmentgrade universe has an adequate capital structure that balances shareholders and debtholders suggesting the credit cycle is in the middle of the expansion stage And while Apples rise in debt has significantly outpaced its earnings growth this is an appropriate capital structure for a maturing company However it is a bit unsettling that a company as innovative Apple cannot find more significant reinvestment opportunities Anemic investment and topline growth by corporations are a concern especially if they persist However the Feds efforts to stimulate economic growth should help unlock corporate Americas tremendous operating leverage
