#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>launched its new Surface this week and it has been gathering rave reviews Many analysts think its combination of a full Windows OS not the slimmeddown RT version on previous Surface tablets thinness and ability to operate as both a tablet and a PC make it a great product for business And at it is cheaper than any tablet from market pioneer Apple NASDAQ AAPL Meanwhile Apple keeps promoting the new Apple Watch which was debuted last month and is scheduled to release on April It is a new product in a market segment wearables which has had very little development and very few competitive products While there is a lot of hoopla there are also a lot of skeptics who wonder why anyone would buy an Apple Watch And these skeptics worry that the Apple Watch risks diverting the companys focus away from profitable tablet sales as competitors hone their offerings Looking at these launches gives a lot of insight into how these two companies think and the way they compete One clearly lives in red oceans the other focuses on blue oceans Blue Ocean Strategy Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne was released in by Harvard Business School Press It became a huge bestseller and remains popular today The thesis is that most companies focus on competing against rivals for share in existing markets Competition intensifies features blossom prices decline and the marketplace loses margin as competitors rush to sell cheaper products in order to maintain share In this competitively intense ocean segments are niched and products are commoditized turning the water red either the red ink of losses or the blood of flailing competitors choose your preferred metaphor On the other hand companies can choose to avoid this margineroding competitive intensity by choosing to put less energy into red oceans and instead pioneer blue oceans markets largely untapped by competition By focusing beyond existing market demands companies can identify unmet needs needs beyond lower price or incremental product improvements and then innovate new solutions which create far more profitable uncontested markets blue oceans Obviously the authors are not big fans of operational excellence and a focus on execution but instead see more value for shareholders and employees from innovation and new market development If we look at the new Surface we see what looks to be a very good product Certainly a product which is competitive The Surface has great specifications a lot of adaptability and meets many user needs and it is available at what appears to be a favorable price when compared with iPads But it is being launched into a very very red ocean The market for inexpensive personal computing devices is filled with a lot of products Dont forget that before we had tablets we had netbooks Lowcost scaledback yet very useful Microsoftbased PCs which can be purchased at prices that are less than half the cost of a Surface And although the Surface can be used as a tablet the number of apps it has is a fraction of competitive iOS and Android products and the developer community has not yet embraced creating new apps for Windows tablets So Surface is more than a netbook but also a lot more expensive Additionally the market has Chromebooks lowcost devices using Google Chrome which give most of the capability users need plus extensive internetcloud application access at prices less than a third that of Surface In fact amidst the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Apple announcements Google GOOG GOOGL announced that it was releasing a new ChromeBit stick which could be plugged into any monitor then work with any Bluetoothenabled keyboard and mouse to turn your TV into a computer And this is expected to sell for as little as or maybe less This is classic redocean behavior The market is being fragmented into things that work as PCs things that work as tablets meaning run apps instead of applications things that deliver the functionality of one or the other but without traditional hardware and things that are a hybrid of both And prices are plummeting Intense competition multiple suppliers and eroding margins Ouch The winners in this market will undoubtedly generate sales But will they make decent profits At low initial prices and software that is either deeply discounted or free Googles cloudbased MS Office competitive products are free and buyers of Surface receive year free of MS Office in the cloud as well as a free upgrade to Windows it is far from obvious how profitable these products will be Amidst this intense competition for sales of tablets and other lowend devices Apple seems to be completely focused on selling a product that not many people seem to want At least not yet In one of the quirkier product launch messages thats been used Apple is saying it developed the Apple Watch because its other innovative product line the iPhone is ruining your life Apple is saying that its leaders have looked into the future and they think todays technology is going to move onto our bodies Become far more personal More interactive more knowledgeable about its owner and more capable of being helpful without being an interruption They see a future where we dont need a keyboard mouse or other artificial interface to connect to technology that improves our productivity Right That is easy to discount Apples leaders are betting on a vision Not a market They could be right Or they could be wrong They want us to trust them Meanwhile if tablet sales falter if Surface and ChromeBit do steal the low end or some other segment of the tablet market if smartphone sales slip if other forward looking products like ApplePay and iBeacon dont catch on This week we see two companies fundamentally different methods of competing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>thinks in relation to its historical core markets and engaging in bloody battles to win share It looks at existing markets in this case tablets and thinks about what it has to do to win salesshare at all cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a red ocean competitor Apple on the other hand pioneers new markets Nobody needed an iPod folks were happy enough with Sony Walkman and Discman Everybody loved their Razr phones and BlackBerries until Apple gave them an iPhone and an armload of apps Netbook sales were skyrocketing until iPads came along providing greater mobility and a different way of getting the job done Apples success has not been built upon defending historical markets Rather it has pioneered new markets that made existing markets obsolete Its success has never looked obvious Contrarily many of its products looked quite underwhelming when launched Questionable And it has cannibalized its own products as it brought out new ones remember when iPods were so new there were the iPod mini iPod nano and iPod Touch After years of declining iPod sales the company has stopped reporting them Apple avoids red oceans and prefers to develop blue ones Which company will be more successful in Time will tell But since Apple has gone from being nearly bankrupt to the most valuable publicly traded company in the USA Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has gone up in value Apple has risen While most of us prefer the competition in red oceans so far Apple has demonstrated what Blue Ocean Strategy authors claimed that it is more profitable to find blue oceans And theyve shown us they can do it Source Surface And
