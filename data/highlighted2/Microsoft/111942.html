VIAB by J Mintzmyer Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article Learn more about PRO Disney DIS is a wonderful company and a contender for the BuffettMunger honor in terms of its wide moat and relative pricing power While DIS is a wonderful company and of the opinionated pieces on Seeking Alpha since May have reminded us of that fact the valuation metrics are simply horrendous Despite love from the DGI crowd DIS dividend growth over the past years is only annualized when normalized for payout ratio DIS faces cyclical exposure and capital intensive commitments via resorts movie and merchandise blowouts are fully priced and its cash cow ESPN is illprepared for potentially disastrous secular shifts Disney is extremely expensive based on free cash flow poised for a massive plunge if a single tripping factor is hit downside potential This is another contribution to a continuing series in which I profile some of my favorite blue chip holdings I keep approximately of my assets indexed and in blue chips so this is a very important field for me As Ive stated before my focus is on quality companies at a reasonable price although I appreciate and prefer a strong bargain quality companies rarely go on a fire sale When they do theres often deeper concerns As Buffett and Munger best put it its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price This week Im taking a different approach and profiling a true BuffettMunger firm that trades for far beyond its reasonable fair value Walt Disney Co NYSE DIS is a wonderful company trading into a very expensive price range with downside of over even to a rich valuation limit If DIS traded at the midpoint of traditional bluechips roughly x of y average free cash flow DIS has up to downside I believe there are significant risks to those who invest in DIS based on recent earnings future content prospects or dividend growth expectations due to extreme headwinds facing Disneys cash cow ESPN and to the inherently cyclical and capitalintensive theme park and cruise line business I believe that none of ESPNs risks are priced in and that the market is not prepared for a potential cyclical entertainment downturn after five straight years of increased performance Disney is often touted by dividend growth investor DGI types for its extremely impressive dividend growth rates backed up by rapidly improving fundamentals and continual share repurchases This is not an attack against the DGI investment strategy I think there are strong merits to that approach but the relative entrypoint of an investment and its realistic growth trajectory are far more important than focusing on a myopic view of dividend increases At first glance Disney has grown its dividend by annualized over the past years with eyepopping year annualized growth of The chart below shows the relative ascent In the yield for DIS was approximately the yield in was and the current yield is Meanwhile the payout percentage of free cash flow in was the payout percentage in was and the current payout percentage is approximately The dividend growth is indeed impressive but the payout percentages have doubled since while the yield remains flat This is something that the basic DGI premise misses Accounting for a flat payout ratio the yr and yr annualized growth in dividends would be closer to and respectively Keep that in mind when considering the valuation multiples Disney has steadily repurchased shares over the past decade which has allowed a Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm rollup while still reducing the total share count remarkably impressive Over the past years DIS has spent B net to reduce the share count by approximately M shares or approximately per share The average price paid seems rather atrocious but this is due to heavy share compensation and the rollup issuances This is actually a pretty impressive expansion and repurchase program one of the best Ive ever seen DIS has received a bargain purchase on all three of its major studio acquisitions partially due to what I perceive as the good home discount Disney thrives from a fullcircle ecosystem spurred by strong historical and future pipelines of proprietary content from the Disney Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm brands Disney profits upfront from their production and then continues to milk the content value through merchandise sales theme park deals and network licensing Each visit to a theme park also bolsters the demand for merchandise and spurs interest in future content Unlike other movie production firms the profit share directly from the theater tickets and DVD sales is only a fraction of the total lifecycle profit potential In addition to the content lifecycle the strong DIS asset is their network brands primarily ESPN ESPN is the worlds strongest sports news and live coverage brand and has no direct competition Disney has no legitimate equal in the content world with the closest peers including TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOXA Time Warner NYSE TWX and Viacom NASDAQ VIAB Disneys Pixar Studios has provided DIS with continuous smash hits shown in the clipping below Pixar has never produced a single dud and every single release has grossed more than M in current terms The below wallpaper design from Deviant Art highlights all the Pixar movies sans Inside Out The sheet below highlights the history for all of Pixar movies taken from thenumberscom Arguably the worst return on investment was from Cars with a profit of only ignoring the inherent strengthening of the merchandise and themepark branding Disneys Marvel Studios has only improved under Disney management and has consistently churned out successful films See below for the latest from Disney Movies Anywhere With Lucasfilm Star Wars also in the fold including the separate rights to Indiana Jones Disney has a virtually limitless pipeline of films well into the s with a strong likelihood of producing at least blockbusters per year This is before including the vast potential of the legacy content library Disney channel programming Disneybranded cartoons and network licensing Disney profits in a minimum of four stages from each successful movie release cycle boxoffice DVDstreaming merchandise and legacy interaction which includes theme parks and cruises Disney is extremely familyfriendly much more so than Universal Studios or even Dreamworks which often leans towards more mature animation films Disney has grown merchandise sales yearoveryear over the entirety of the past decade and their theme park profits have been on a steady uptrend since hitting a low in Fiscal Boosts from new smashhit movies such as Frozen and the upcoming Star Wars will reverberate for years and continue to trickle in profits This cycle is reinforcing as fun theme park visits are associated with future Disney movies and the movies themselves serve as a sort of implicit advertisement for merchandise Disney owns of ESPN and this is their true source along with their namesake channel of the majority of company profits and a vast majority of the profit growth over the past decade ESPN is the worlds leader in sports content and shows no sign of weakening its dominance of sports content ESPN is unparalleled in sports coverage and has a practical monopoly over the industry Profits have been exploding not due to enhanced subscription growth but rather due to Disneys stranglehold over cable companies ESPN has steadily increased its subscriber fee by over per year since the mids and is currently more expensive by a factor of than its closest channel competitor TNT and is almost x as expensive as Fox Sports Those multiples only factor ESPN and not ESPN or ESPNU Investors often tout Disney and its family appeal and timeless content when considering the business prospects of an investment Most writeups and glowing news articles I read dont even mention the major source of growth As DIS reaches record heights and is arguably the most overpriced blue chip in the entire stock market articles come out touting the No Stock in the World ESPN is often added in as an afterthought or as some sort of bonus property No You dont just add in ESPN as a cherry on top ESPN is the story of growth Disney is more dependent on ESPNs performance for their profits than they are on Pixar Marvel parks cruises and toys put together Note Im not concerned about ESPNs continued domination of sports content but rather their continued dominance of cablecos and millions of unwitting subscribers ESPNfueled growth of the total cable business accounted for of the profit growth over the past decade and now accounts for a total of of the total profits When you buy DIS today you arent buying the House of Mouse with a side of sports anymore you are now buying the King of Monopolized Sports who also has a Mouse and super hero buddies who live in a galaxy far far away I submit the logo below creative mashup by yours truly for consideration but I doubt Disney corporate will adopt it The below table from the most recent annual report K highlights the subscribers of each of Disneys network properties Note the M subscribers to the ESPN package How many of these subscribers would remain if they had to pay the effective commercialized rate of per month Note that research has shown that the average viewer believes ESPN is worth per month while DIS currently extorts cable networks to the tune of per subscriber With the major dependence on keeping its artificially high subscriber count due to a lack ie nonexistence of consumer channel preferencing its no wonder that Disney isnt responding well to Verizons NYSE VZ skinny TV initiatives and that Disney CEO Iger is waging a misinformation campaign of his own If you wonder why Disney is in no hurry to offer the network as a directtoconsumer product its most likely because income will plummet as the average of those M people only value ESPN at not the they are currently paying plus cableinternetetc costs and markup and certainly not the ESPN would need to make the same profit The table below shows just how outrageously profitable the cable networks are with profit margins compared to a more normalized profit margin for the broadcasting sector Its funny how the mainstream commentary focuses on how contentstreaming ports like Netflix NASDAQ NFLX will destroy the profit margins at HBO and cable companies like Time Warner NYSE TWC or Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA when in reality its the strong cable content producers who are really raking in the profits on a margin basis and have much more to lose ESPN makes the lions share of its profits from unsustainable subscription revenues at nearly double the rate of its advertising profit The first cracks of ESPNs strength are beginning to emerge and I expect this trend to be a longterm drag on profit growth Note Im not predicting disaster at ESPN I still think its a great brand but lets be honest about the source of growth and its future potential When youre buying the most expensive blue chip on the market you need that growth Disney is enjoying an extremely successful summer and anticipation for a global blowout performance via the th episode of Star Wars scheduled for Christmas Star Wars is most likely going to be the most successful move production in world history not inflation adjusted but were already paying for that Never mind the fact that even in last years alltime record performance studio entertainment only accounted for of profits Even if DIS somehow boosts their profits by an unthinkable x this barely moves the EPS needle beyond expectations What about all that merchandise Last year was another record performance for that sector with profits more than double their levels Even with merchandise through the roof were still only considering of total profits Toymaking and peddling can be a tough gig even when you have strong branding and product potential Just ask Hasbro NASDAQ HAS or see the chart below DIS holds the power by licensing and advertising these toys implicitly via studio content and Disney currently makes almost as much money as Mattel NASDAQ MAT and Hasbro combined times two Theres a reason to be bullish but also to be realistic about upside potential via struggling toymakers and also to use perspective about the upside potential involving a business thats only of the firm Disneys Parks Resorts are a wonderful business approach to capitalizing on a nationwide love affair with our favorite childhood characters With attendance and profits booming DIS continues to boost their ticket prices and is experimenting with dreaded blackout dates to further boost ticket pricing Profits are booming with producing the strongest profits in Disney history at a level of over x the fiscal levels However this business line is capital intensive and is clearly cyclical The US economy has been in recovery for almost years and the stock market has been a oneway ticket to success and wealth since March of Last time the economy dipped it look DIS five years to see a return to previous profit levels despite a globally expanding footprint All the theme park maintenance and expansion has been extremely demanding on the capital expenditure budget With capex rapidly surpassing depreciation charges and also due to cash outflows related to B in cash for Lucasfilm Disneys earnings are far surpassing their actual free cash flow which results in a potentially bloated PE ratio The chart below shows the surprising differences between free cash flow and earnings Disney currently has one of the lowest quality ratios of earnings of the entire bluechip stock market Every quarter IBM NYSE IBM gets lambasted for their earnings disparity visvis free cash flow but Disney gets a free pass Remember that the majority of this involves investing in the parks a notoriously capital intensive business with clear cyclical risks Disneys management is simply pathetic when it comes to this segment How can video games based on Disney products possibly fail They do Just like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT sucks at making cool phones and music players and cant ever seem to make headway in search Disney just cannot figure this one out After an accounting split in which separated consumer products from interactive the only real improvement was that consumer products ie merchandise without video games magically started performing better Iger didnt standstill hey neither did Steve Ballmer and rapidly shed operations and laid off people Interactive still struggled but was showing some signs of life as recorded a profit Suddenly DIS has now changed tact and is remerging the two entities into Disney Consumer Products This is being billed as a fantastic nobrainer but its nothing more than a reversal of what happened just years ago I expect Interactive to continue to be a major source of struggle and confusion for Disney which is unfortunate because selling Disney video games to adoring kiddos and protective parents should be easier than just about anything Over the past months I have counted positive articles on Seeking Alpha lukewarm articles and only negative publication Theres just no difference of opinion out there Ive seen some cautious comments and Tweets but pretty much the entire community is in a love affair with Disney Dont believe me count them yourself Theres been a few greatly written articles that almost convinced me to make DIS my fattest bluechip allocation I wanted to call my mom and dad and have them overweight their retirement account on the mouse I considered buying a my first stock frame for my future children However I also realized the majority of these writeup have involved the due diligence expected from an average taxi driver and have done the fundamental analysis equivalent of taking the year dividend growth rate and extrapolating out into Infinity thats a Disney game btw go Interactive Despite the buy what you love mantra of famed investor Peter Lynch a successful investor needs to dig a little deeper than that What price are we paying today for what level of realistic growth tomorrow Unfortunately the price is never really considered Everyone just sees a ramp that looks like this Even during the Big Fat Panic Week investors were called upon to seek shelter in Disney Thats a great idea seek shelter from potential market contagion by investing in what is arguably the most expensive blue chip on the entire market based on free cash flow Nonetheless it worked at least for the past few days I mean no disrespect to my fellow authors researchers and analysts who love Disney and think its a great investment Disney is a phenomenal company but the valuation fundamentals are simply horrendous We arent talking about a tech startup here but rather a mature company performing near its peak I believe investors are setting up for a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in type disappointment In fact MSFT in was a far better investment idea than Disney has been for months Note that fantastic investment ideas dont necessarily translate to impressive investment results Be careful out there Look at free cash flow below and make your own decisions But first remember where most of the money has been coming from As Ive previously discussed in my other blue chip articles I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow FCF ratio in my valuation targets My broad range is typically from x yield but with DIS I am willing to include a x range yield just to give full credence to the superior business model and growth touted by bulls I cannot think of another blue chip firm in which I would consider an investment over a x FCF multiple Investors focus on DIS dividend growth but FCF is the important metric to track as it is the only way to fund these growing dividend payments The averages are shown in the chart below Note the recent growth leads to a far higher year average Although I believe DIS is a cyclical business I am willing to accept the year range and apply the extremely aggressive x range to get full appreciation for their strong business model This approach results in a fair market capitalization of B to B With B shares outstanding as of April the fair price range for DIS is to I believe this range is extremely generous yet still fails to make DIS attractive DIS is currently trading for x the y average historical free cash flow or x the record numbers produced in Disney is a fantastic brand but the company carries extensive risk in the ESPN cash cow segment which along with other cable content accounts for over of current profits The broadcasting cash flow is at significant risk of seeing profits tumble by as much as on new skinny TV type initiatives and a shift towards more webbased streaming sources Cable companies are often targeted as at extreme risk but digging deeper reveals that brands such as ESPN have far more to lose from a change of the status quo Disney is also receiving a large portion of their profits approximately on a historical basis from the clearly cyclical and capital intensive theme park and cruise line businesses DIS is aggressively valued at a full value range of to with even the upper bound providing of downside based on the current market price of per share Ill be the first to agree that I exited Disney too early on valuation concerns but I hope other investors can avoid what atbest will be a decade of flatness or potentially a significant correction course Investing in DIS today is lining up to be a similar mistake as investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or WalMart NYSE WMT in In the meantime sentiment remains hot Since I sold my shares last summer out of valuation concerns I never seriously considered shorting Disney However valuation multiples have blown past anything within reason for this mature stage company facing immense challenges in their most lucrative segment On top of that DIS continues to climb even as the markets appear to be worsening I believe a short in Disney will serve as an effective hedge for a bluechip portfolio as other stocks such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and WalMart are far less likely to drop in similar fashion due to their valuation floor For those like myself who prefer options I believe two sets of puts look appealing for Disney the August strike at selling for roughly and the January strike at selling in the range The August put is a way to play continuing market contagion in China and Greecerelated panic at an extremely low implied volatility IV The January gives exposure for any potential misstep or trend reversal also at a fair price I doubt DIS will return to its fair range of to without a market correction but a slight dip on valuation concerns or ratings changes is certainly feasible in the short term Source Time To Short Disney Horrendously Expensive And
