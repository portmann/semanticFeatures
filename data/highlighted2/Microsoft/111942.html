In the meantime, sentiment remains hot.Since I sold my shares last summer out of valuation concerns, I never seriously considered shorting Disney.However, valuation multiples have blown past anything within reason for this mature stage company facing immense challenges in their most lucrative segment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On top of that, DIS continues to climb even as the markets appear to be worsening. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe a short in Disney will serve as an effective hedge for a blue-chip portfolio , as other stocks such as <b>Microsoft</b> and Wal-Mart are far less likely to drop in similar fashion due to their valuation ` floor . ' (Microsoft: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For those like myself who prefer options, I believe two sets of puts look appealing for Disney, the August strike at $110, selling for roughly $1.15-$1.25, and the January 2016 strike at $100, selling in the $1.70-$1.80 range. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The August put is a way to play continuing market contagion in China and Greece-related panic at an extremely low implied volatility (IV). (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The January 2016 gives exposure for any potential misstep or trend reversal, also at a fair price. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I doubt DIS will return to its "fair" range of $54 to $68 without a market correction, but a slight 10-20% dip on valuation concerns or ratings changes is certainly feasible in the short term.
