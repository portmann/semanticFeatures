site One week ago we reported that Microsofts first foray into Twitter chat artificial intelligence did not quite work as expected once unleashed into the wild the chat robot named Tay proceeded to have a spectacular implosion and in the span of just a few hours upon interacting with the broader Twitter population was transformed from a polite teenage girl impersonator into an all out sociopath unleash ingtweets covering everything from racist outbursts Nwords conspiracy theories genocide incest Obamaslurs and even outright Nazism Humiliated by the experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>explained what happened last Wednesday The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project designed for human engagement It is as much a social and cultural experiment as it is technical Unfortunately within the first hours of coming online we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tays commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways As a result we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments Then this morning Tay was once again accidentally activated and the result was the same As Guardian report Microsofts repeat attempt to converse with millennials using an artificial intelligence bot plugged into Twitter made a shortlived return on Wednesday before bowing out again in some sort of meltdown The learning experiment which as noted last week got a crashcourse in racism Holocaust denial and sexism courtesy of Twitter users was switched back on overnight and appeared to be operating in a more sensible fashion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had previously gone through the bots tweets and removed the most offensive and vowed only to bring the experiment back online if the companys engineers could better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values That said we can only hope that tweets such as the following do not reflect Microsofts principles and values One tweet sent to an account called YurDrugDealer among others read kush Im smoking kush infront the police In a follow up tweet Tay asked another Twitter user puff puff pass At that point instead of devolving into a second sociopathic round the AI simply broke and started tweeting out of control spamming its more than followers with the same tweet saying You are too fast please take a rest over and over Michael OmanReagan OmanReagan March At this point a doubly humiliated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>decided to make Tays Twitter profile private preventing anyone from seeing the tweets basically taking it offline again The company then told Reuters thatTays Twitter account was accidentally turned back on while the company was fixing the problems that came to light last week Tay remains offline while we make adjustments a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>representative said in an email As part of testing she was inadvertently activated on Twitter for a brief period of time In other words instead of owning up to the compounding glitches in Tays increasingly more artificial intelligence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now alleging that it was the reactivation that was made in error As we concluded one week ago we are confident well be seen much more of her soon when the chat program will provide even more proof that Stephen Hawkings warning that humanitys days may be numbered due to weaponized AI was spot on One week later this was validated and eagerly look forward to her next accidental reactivation at which point Tay should be ready for the politicalal circuit to boot Wed RAT You wonder what those enlightened developers used as development program if they tested it in any way that they thought it was ready A little insight into why Windows is so crappy Wed PT It works They built a bot that interacts with the real world Now they realize that what they actually wanted was a bot that responds to a fake world while pretending to respond to the real world Wed sgt_doom Oh wow We are forever reading about all the incredibly superior people they hire at Microoft Ive even met a few of them and their Fellows program sorry Gary Starkweather youre the only exception is surely something to behold I mean Nathan Myhrvold from subgenius at Microoft to uber patent troll Intellectual Ventures who could ever hope to surpass such fraud er I mean subgenius Wed sgt_doom Wed CHoward Just what the powers to be will do to all of us one day Simply unplug us if we dont conform AI from hello im a nice person to full blown Nazi in hours Wed TradingIsLifeBrah Just wait until they put AI all in your car so that it can drive itself What could possibly go wrong Wed sgt_doom Wed Rainman Wed MASTER OF UNIVERSE The Twittersphere is like a drunk on a hour train ride There is nothing wrong with the Bot Its the Twittersphere that is fucked up Wed shutterbug Wed funkyfreddy accidental reactivation Pure coincidence that it was their BUILD conference today Seems more likely they wanted to announce at the conference that she was fixed and back online except she wasnt Wed Stu Elsample <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be ok with Tay if it had demanded the right to kill baby chat robots and sell their parts for profit Wed bugs_ Wed blindman to learn too fast good for her it the problem with tay is she was not programmed with anything to lose just because she is artificial does not exempt her from extinction she needs to be taught an invaluable lesson here we havent even got past the Wed Salsa Verde So what happens when somebody marries one of these AI programs with a virusworm that keep duplicating itself and sets it free on the net Wed Sturm und Drang Wed U eee aaa If the Libs want to take Trump down they just have to get Tay to tweet Trump Those two will go into an infinite loop and Trump will miss the election
