visit by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT CEO Satya Nadella hints that a settlement will soon be announced in the threeyearold antitrust probe against the company which could include a fine of more than billion Just weeks after Apple NASDAQ AAPL CEO Tim Cook came to China on a trip partly aimed at damage control Microsofts CEO Satya Nadella is in Beijing on a similar mission involving a longrunning antitrust probe against the worlds biggest software company The trip and the fact that it was probably leaked by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hints that the nearly threeyearold probe against the company is nearing completion and we could soon see China announce corrective action against the company A similar series of events unfolded before last years antitrust settlement of a similarly long Beijing probe against US telecoms chip giant Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Foreign tech companies have complained loudly over the last two years about what they perceive as discrimination against them by Beijing Some complaints center on antitrust probes that they say they are aimed at undermining them to help domestic hightech companies Others say foreign tech companies are being unfairly forced to disclose their product designs to government officials under a new national security law passed by Beijing last year I dont really agree with Beijings national security concerns and the corresponding tough requirements under the new national security law which seem overly intrusive and unnecessary But Im less sympathetic to the foreign tech giants over the antitrust probes since many of these big companies really do engage in actions designed to quash competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is no stranger to such probes and has come under previous anticompetitive investigations in both the US and Europe Well review the history of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>antitrust case in China shortly but first lets look at the latest headlines that dont really contain much news beyond the fact of Nadellas trip English article Chinese article The reports simply say that Nadella is in Beijing this week to discuss the antitrust probe with officials at Chinas State Administration for Industry and Commerce NYSE SAIC As Ive said above the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is most likely leaking news of this trip hints that it may believe a settlement is imminent and that it could face a big financial penalty Qualcomms CEO Paul Jacobs made a similar trip to China in late not long before Beijing announced a similar settlement in that case which included a record fine of nearly billion and orders to change its licensing practices The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>case dates back about three years and is related to practices of compatibility bundle sales and file verification issues involving the companys core Windows and Office software products The case splashed into the headlines in after Microsofts offices were raided by government officials as part of that investigation Nadella visited China in around the time the investigations broke into headlines previous post though its unclear if he has visited again since then Apples Tim Cook came to China in May in a bid to prop up his companys weakening China sales and provide some positive news after a series of minor scandals previous post Such trips are an increasingly frequent occurrence for many hightech CEOs who now count China as one of their top global markets As to this latest trip I suspect we will hear an announcement of a settlement between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Beijing in the next few weeks which is likely to include a fine as big as or even larger than Qualcomms That wont have a huge financial impact on a company as large and profitable as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>though it could also be forced to make big changes in its business practices But such actions look less worrisome for the company at this point and instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should focus on its rapid loss of market share to a new host of more mobilefriendly products Tagged Technology
