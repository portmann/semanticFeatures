into a nearly drop Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site From the Slope of Hope Its time for me to travel to the place I always prefer way out on a limb My Apple credentials are sound I bought my first Macintosh in early I workedat Apple headquartersfor several years in the late s When did I buy my first iPhone The day it came out First iPad The day it came out I even wrote a few books about the Macintosh And some of you know the videos Ive done about that Silicon Valley deity Mr Steven Paul JobsSo I dont haveanyantiApple ax to grind Having said all that I think Apples best days are behind it The fat and happy executive staff led by the charismafree Tim Cook is sitting on top of the most valuable company on the planet Subtly and slowly thoughApple has already lost onequarter of its entire market cap Tuesday of course is when Apple reports their earnings after the close I have no clue about Apples fundamentals but Ive seen a chart or two in my life and this longterm chart of Apple looks jumpingupanddown bearish Looking a bit closer there is a massive topping pattern which Ive helpfully shaded in green for you The strength we had late last week pushed up right back toward all that overhead supply and early on Monday I shorted the stock at what I hope is a price Ill be pleased with Now heres the goingoutonalimb part I suspect that Apple is more likely to be down on Wednesday than up I further think that in the months ahead Apple is going to find itself at a place no one dare imagine in the s I have tinted in area below which shows a suggested target which just so happens to also close a gap beautifully set before a massive roar higher in the price a couple of years ago I had some lunatic things to say about oil late in although I held my tongue about some price projections since they seemed so preposterous Im not going to offer Apple this courtesyI think the drop theyve seen is going to blossom into a nearly dropI suspect ol Cookie is going to be checking out his ridiculous Apple Watch sooner or later to see when its time for him to finally leave and enjoy the vast personal fortune he acquired from Jobs genius Tue dreadnaught Tue TeaClipper The only thing that matters is the bottom line We will see if Apple goes into the direction forecast by me or goes in the direction forecast by Tim Knight I wonder if he gave me a down vote Oh I wouldt be surprised if Apple slides in price in the short term Mon Heterodox economics Well I have money on the line I brought Apple Stock around three weeks ago at Im down a littleits current price is Interestingly enough just a few days ago I was up about percent on Apple It fulfills three investment criteria that has worked well for me Its a SP stock Its within percent of its week low I use the companys products Tue hal As much as I like Apple they and others in the real economy have allowd the bankster class to destroy their customer base and now the situation is at a point where they deserve everything they have coming to them Destroying the purchasing power of our customers and saddling them with debt What could possibly go wrong That will never affect us Mon DaveA Mon tempo Of course Tim has tight stops on his short as he has been wrong for the past years on most of his calls companies must reinvent themselves every years or so I mention this to many who think I am crazy and say they can buy any co in the world w all their money and everything will be just fine Tue Heterodox economics When I was following his blog Slope of Hope I didnt make money I probably missed investment opportunities by being influenced by his blog When I stopped following his blog my investments grew Mon pitz A good rule of thumb is that when firms that ordinarily operate in highmargin areas of the economystart chasing low margin businesses that the firm is well past its prime In the case of Apple its their efforts at developing a car A very low margin business that suffers significant global overcapacity Sure the Apple car might be nice but it is very unlikely theyll be able to derive enough of a premium to make it worthwhile Tue Heterodox economics Not really a good rule of thumb One counterexample is Amazon It is well known that their margins are thin Amazon has had thin margins since its beginning Yet its been a highly successful company Tue pitz Going years without meaningful GAAPcompliant profit is not a hallmark of a highly successful company Ill just leave it at that Tue TeaClipper Only because of its tax avoidance schemes it deploys around the world which are coming to an end as governments scrabble for any available income Tue pitz Amazon would need profit to have a need ofavoiding tax Amazon fails on the simple issue of viability their business model is not sustainable as it costs just as much to fulfill sales as they take in as revenue from sales Tue PlayMoney and is way overpriced I love amazon and use itbut am also short amazon Looking back years or so their growth rate is just over Over times free cash flowinsane I wouldnt go long any stock now other than a very short bounce trade I look at it as sort of a generational thing it was just about years ago they were at and speculation swirled that Apple might be finished pecked clean by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>etc From that low point its been a Great
