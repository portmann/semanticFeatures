neutrality Amazon has all the right to forbid rival products on its online marketplace The new gamescentric Apple NASDAQ AAPL TV already prompted Amazon NASDAQ AMZN to immediately counter it with the Fire TV Gaming Edition However even though Apples streaming video TV box is more expensive Jeff Bezos still felt the need to ban it from Amazons marketplace The Verge says Amazons decision is a baffling question but it is so easy to understand Apples decision to release a console gaming iOS TV device and its ambition to become a streaming video service provider are seen as threats by Amazon Bezos therefore promptly exercised his prerogative to eliminate current and upcoming threats to Amazon I believe there is no such thing as retail store neutrality The store owner has every right to exclusively sell its own products It is in Amazons best interest to stop helping Apple and its thirdparty partners sell the new vastly improved Apple TV units Amazon is anxious to protect its Fire TV and Prime Video business Bezos is no longer happy that Apple and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are exploiting Amazons online store and customer base to propagate their competing products and video streaming business Amazon was only being polite in using the excuse that the Apple TV and Chromecast are not compatible with Amazon Prime Video Amazons release of the gamesappsfriendly Fire TV stick last year helped it outsell the Apple TV This was largely due to Apples noninclusion of games and apps on its Apple TV However Apples decision to make its new TV box gamesappsfriendly eliminated the only advantage of the Fire TV It is true that Apple is having a hard time getting a content licensing deal with content owners which led to the postponement of that companys subscriptionbased streaming TVvideo service However is just around the corner Tim Cook is hellbent that Apple will have its own streaming video business next year Amazon knows all too well that Apple has enough cash to eventually pay what Hollywood is demanding for it content library Banning the Apple TV is Amazons little way of further delayinglimiting the dissemination of a rival hardwareservice It is wrong for people to assume that this will not have an impact on sales of the Apple TV and Yes Apple has its own online shop and retail stores to offload its streaming device However Amazons vast marketplace definitely helped sell many units of the Apple TV products in North America and in other markets where Amazon operates Amazons ban is going to hurt sales of the Apple TV to the point that it will continue to lag behind the Fire TV It is an intentional attack specifically against Apple TV Bezos will still allow Roku to sell its products because that firm doesnt seem to have any intention of competing with Amazon Prime and Instant Video Amazon will also still allow the sale of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Xbox One and PlayStation Unlike Apple Sony NYSE SNE and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>have not made any overt announcement that they will build their own subscriptionbased streaming media business in the US Billions of dollars are at stake in the US streaming TVvideo industry This is not only about hardware sales The more vicious battle is over getting the most people to sign up for paid streaming services Bezos made the ruthless preemptive strike by banning the Apple TV He did this knowing he is risking a retaliatory ban for Amazons Prime Video iOS app According to NPD Groups chart below of US homes will have streaming media gadgets by next year The big fight is over who will get the most paying subscribers out of those million American households Tim Cook definitely wants some of those monthly subscriptions that Amazon Prime and Instant Video now enjoys It is still up to Tim Cook if he will really retaliate against Amazon Amazon has a few apps on the iTunes App Store Apple could use the same excuse that these Amazon apps are not compatible with iOS and are therefore worthy of the ban hammer We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell
