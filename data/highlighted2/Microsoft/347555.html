growth The chatter about Apple NASDAQ AAPL always seems to change The company used to be as good as dead back in the s and then it was unbeatable before a lot of people wrote it off after Steve Jobs passed away Last year pundits were once again bullish on the companys prospects before turning more bearish lately The company held an event on March where it among other things revealed a widely expected new and smaller iPhone called the iPhone SE The moves are believed by most to be an initiative to increase sales in poorer countries like India where growth in the number of smartphones is expected to be high over the coming years The stock has roughly doubled over the last five years Certainly nothing to sneeze at If you add in the approximate yield of investors have enjoyed since the returns are even better Even so this growth has come with a lot of volatility with the stock almost halving between and and dropping from approximately a year ago to now Considering the massive buyback over the period the performance is actually not that impressive As most people know there was a fairly long hiatus in Apples dividend between its suspension in and until it was reinstated in Since the summer of the splitadjusted dividend has grown from to for a total percentagewise growth of or a year The payout ratio naturally has an upward spike initially as it was only reinstated in the summer of From a top of approximately in early it has since fallen back to the current level of That is a conservative number by any measure and leaves a lot of headroom for the board when considering future dividend increases The dividend itself has a steady stepwise growth pattern to it a pattern very much appreciated by dividend growth investors If we are to believe Tim Cooks statement at the Q earnings release the company is absolutely committed to keep this pattern going far into the future Given Apples incredible earnings cash flow and rising cash pile over the years I think a lot of people have been a bit disappointed that the dividend hasnt risen faster Well first of all lets not forget that the company has a gigantic buyback program of billion which makes up the lions share of its total capital return program The board thus seems to favor the more taxefficient method of buybacks when returning capital to shareholders Second of all a lot of the profits earned are earned outside of the United States That makes it hard or rather costly to bring that money back to the US as it would trigger taxes when repatriated The taxefficient way to solve this has been to issue debt and use those funds to finance the buybacks It is therefore reasonable to believe that the board will hold back on committing itself to too high of a dividend thereby risking having to issue more and more debt to fund it It is more likely that it would want the dividend to be more or less covered by cash flow generated at home and issue debt to buy back stocks as the buyback is way more flexible in terms of size adjustment than the dividend In all years since the dividend was reinstated Apple has consistently been announcing the dividend increase together with the companys Q report in late April In recent years strong EPS growth has given a lot of headroom for the board when setting the dividend When EPS grows by plus its quite easy to increase the dividend by the same magnitude as the payout ratio wont be affected Estimates for the current year however is for virtually no growth and some even predict a slightly lower EPS The board can then either decide to stay put at the current payout ratio or they can choose to see through the nearterm weakness and increase the dividend anyway and let the payout ratio rise Given the companys commitment to dividend hikes the only question is really how much of an increase to the payout ratio the board is comfortable with On the low end an absolute minimum would be a hike in the low single digits The reason for that is simply that Tim Cook has already all but promised an increase Barring an extreme catastrophe to Apples cash pile over the coming weeks unlikely to put it mildly the dividend will be hiked by at least a couple of percentage points As earnings growth is not likely to be stellar this year that puts a brake on the upside when it comes to a hike Though the board is likely to see through the current slow period it is quite unlikely to boost the dividend by more than its historical average in such a year Last year with rapid EPS growth I thought it would be a bit aggressive and go for a hike in the high end of an range It turned out to land in the lower end of the range instead Based on this I would expect the board to have a ceiling in terms of a percentagewise dividend hike in the low double digits One useful metric we can look at is the trend of dividend hikes over the years As Apple has now been paying and increasing its dividend for several years this metric is gaining in strength The first hike was of the second of and the last one of This gives us a clue that the board likes to hike the dividend at around the highsingle digit lowdouble digit area It further shows us that it is not overly concerned with the EPS movement from year to year as this has been everything from great to acceptable during these years Based on the analysis above I would expect the board to hike the dividend by between and When rounded that would put the new quarterly dividend at between and A major risk that Apple has quite clearly been emphasizing itself is the negative impact a rising dollar has on earnings as reported in US dollars The company supplied some supplementary material to its Q earnings announcement to highlight the impact of the changing currencies Another risk is constant global competition from its wellknown rivals Alphabet GOOG GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Samsung OTCSSNLF and from newer hungry competitors like Xiaomi A company as profitable as Apple will always draw attention and competitors looking to grab a piece of the profit pool Theres also a risk of the landscape changing entirely with new technologies popping up driven by new competitors which might replace Apple as a tech leader Finally there is a risk that the cash pile large as it is will be eroded over time by investments that will be costly and have a very uncertain profit opportunity like for instance the car initiative Apple is most certainly not an underfollowed name so if there is any company out there that should be priced efficiently this is it Still every individual investor has to make up his or her own mind as to whether or not the price of the stock justifies what one perceives as the underlying value When looking at some key multiples I like to compare those multiples with the competition As competitors I have chosen Samsung as it competes fiercely with Apple in the smartphone space and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a more traditional software competitor The table above reveals that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>certainly seems expensive at the moment with a priceearnings ratio far above the others at x and a pricesales ratio almost double that of Apples The only category won by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is the dividend yield which is in line with the yield of the SP Apple actually comes in second place in all three categories with what must be said to be a modest priceearnings ratio of only x Remember that a lot of what constitutes the price in Apples case is cash so from an operational standpoint it is even cheaper The most expensive company in terms of yield is Samsung though it is clearly the cheapest in the other two categories <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>looks too expensive for my taste whereas both Apple and Samsung seem quite interesting at these levels considering that the priceearnings for the SP is x at the moment The mean analyst estimate for EPS growth at Apple over the next five years is for an annual growth of Assuming that the priceearnings ratio stays stable and adding in the dividend yield of we arrive at an estimated total annual shareholder return over the next five years of That is above the longterm average returns of the stock market When you can get such a return from the most profitable company in the world with a stellar brand and nice dividend growth I would consider this a prudent investment for any dividend growth investor out there Apple just revealed a new and smaller iPhone that will hopefully contribute to sales growth going forward The company is committed to sharing its vast cash flow and cash pile with its shareholders by way of share buybacks and rising dividends Expect this commitment to result in a dividend hike of in late April Apple is transforming into a safe stock with nice return potential for dividend growth investors Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this
