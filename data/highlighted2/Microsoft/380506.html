has sued the US government for the right to tell its customers when a federal agency is looking at their emails the latest in a series of clashes over privacy between the technology industry and Washington The lawsuit filed on Thursday in federal court in Seattle argues that the government is violating the US Constitution by preventing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents The governments actions contravene the Fourth Amendment which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property the suit argues and Microsofts First Amendment right to free speech The Department of Justice is reviewing the filing spokeswoman Emily Pierce said Microsofts suit focuses on the storage of data on remote servers rather than locally on peoples computers which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data Using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ECPA the government is increasingly directing investigations at the parties that store data in the socalled cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>says in the lawsuit The yearold law has long drawn scrutiny from technology companies and privacy advocates who say it was written before the rise of the commercial Internet and is therefore outdated People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>says in the lawsuit It adds that the government has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations The lawsuit represents the newest front in the battle between technology companies and the US government over how much private businesses should assist government surveillance By filing the suit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is taking a more prominent role in that battle dominated by Apple Inc AAPLO in recent months due to the governments efforts to get the company to write software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in a December massacre in San Bernardino California Apple backed by big technology companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had complained that cooperating would turn businesses into arms of the state Just as Apple was the company in the last case and we stood with Apple we expect other tech companies to stand with us Microsofts Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a phone interview after the suit was filed One security expert questioned Microsofts motivation and timing Its lawsuit was one hundred percent motivated by business interests and timed to capitalize on new interest in customer privacy issues spurred in part by Apples dispute said DJ Rosenthal a former White House cyber security official in the Obama administration As Microsofts Windows and other legacy software products are losing some traction in an increasingly mobile and Internetcentric computing environment the companys cloudbased business is taking on more importance Chief Executive Satya Nadellas describes Microsofts efforts as mobile first cloud first Its customers have been asking the company about government surveillance Smith said suggesting that the issue could hurt Microsofts ability to win or keep cloud customers In its complaint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>says over the past months it has received legal orders under the ECPA of which prevented <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>from disclosing that the government is seeking customer data through warrants subpoenas and other requests Most of the ECPA requests apply to individuals not companies and provide no fixed end date to the secrecy provision <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and other companies won the right two years ago to disclose the number of government demands for data they receive This case goes farther requesting that it be allowed to notify individual businesses and people that the government is seeking information about them Increasingly US companies are under pressure to prove they are helping protect consumer privacy The campaign gained momentum in the wake of revelations by former government contractor Edward Snowden in that the government routinely conducted extensive phone and Internet surveillance to a much greater degree than believed Late last year after Reuters reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had not alerted customers including leaders of Chinas Tibetan and Uigher minorities that their email was compromised by hackers operating from China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said publicly it would adopt a policy of telling email customers when it believed their email had been hacked by a government The companys lawsuit on Thursday comes a day after a US congressional panel voted unanimously to advance a package of reforms to the ECPA Lastminute changes to the legislation removed an obligation for the government to notify a targeted user whose communications are being sought Instead the bill would require disclosure of a warrant only to a service provider which retains the right to voluntarily notify users unless a court grants a gag order It is unclear if the bill will advance through the Senate and become law this year Separately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is fighting a US government warrant to turn over data held in a server in Ireland which the government argues is lawful under another part of the ECPA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>argues the government needs to go through a procedure outlined in a legalassistance treaty between the US and Ireland Twitter Inc TWTRN is fighting a separate battle in federal court in Northern California over public disclosure of government requests for information on users The case is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corp v United States Department of
