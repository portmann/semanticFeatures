Numbers and Keynote apps The upgrades are meant to give AAPL more of an SMBenterprise usecase focus a key market that the company is now overtly targeting But this market is defended by a formidable and capable incumbent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Apple NASDAQ AAPL is finally out with its splitscreen update for its Pages Numbers and Keynote apps nearly one month after releasing the newest iteration of its operating system While not a notable delay between updates the focus on time here is important in the scheme of things especially because I believe Apple is in a race against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT for SMB small and mediumsize businessesenterprise dominance This race by the way is a twohorse race between Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for market share leadership with Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL possibly entering the fold over time I just believe that the SMBenterprise really only has the choice between Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at least right now when it comes to devices and software for executing business functions No other company has the comprehensiveness of either portfolio that of devices or software referring specifically to productivity suite software at least not yet to trap an SMBenterprise within an ecosystem Of course both the SMB and the enterprise do have the option of using and many do choose to use disparate solutions to address their needs That said Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are in a clear race with each other to complete the missing parts of each companys respective ecosystems For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>this largely means devices For Apple this largely means software Yes Apple fans despite the companys consumer device dominance and therefore operating software dominance AAPLs SMBenterprise presence from a software standpoint is a hole in its model its looking to address The most recent clear evidence of this is Apples new enterprisefocused iPad and the abovenoted paired updates with its device iterations to its enterprisefocused software apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>on the other hand is dominant from an enterprise operating system and productivity suite standpoint but lacks the device dominance in the enterprise space that Apple has shown on the consumer side and is beginning to show on the enterprise side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a slew of devices the Surface Pro the Surface Hub the Surface Book etc that it has launched or will launch in an effort to begin trying to take device market share I should state here that I am long Apple common and hold no position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>That said I currently give the upper hand and advantage in the race to ecosystem completion to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has the incumbent advantage of being the software and productivity suite of choice for the enterprise this attaches to it an incredibly high switching cost The disruption or potential disruption that could be experienced should an enterprise attempt to switch software and productivity suites is huge Maybe so huge and history has shown this to prove out that the enterprise never attempts the switch Ive also seen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>take great strides unthinkable strides just a few years ago in building out its device tech and capacity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also brings to the table a size and financial capacity that makes it a more than formidable competitor to Apples usurping attempts Knowing that the following is how I would go about siphoning market share if I were Apple This plan is in no way comprehensive and is open to additions and welcomed criticism in the comments section below Apple has shown this to be the case in other facets of its business If it is threatened by a competitor it either buys the competitor not likely in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or it commoditizes the competitors advantage negating the advantage by economically suppressing its competition into submission By doing this Apple also gains early adopters assuming the techcapacity is new proliferation in general and branding integrity for the techcapacity While the disruption of a softwareproductivity suite might be great if the financials behind the risk justify the risk the risk will likely be taken by the SMBenterprise This could be an easy way for Apple to Little Bighorn the nonconsumer space by first starting with SMB market share where economics would likely be easiest to justify the risk of switching software and working its way up the nonconsumer chain Commoditization is realistic and is something Apple could control entirely at its device economics The opposite of the commoditization strategy would be to go on the offensive Apple could limit device connectivity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>softwareproductivity suite endpoints to its devices While risky this strategy could yield huge results Again AAPL is dominant on the consumer device side Apple also Im sure realizes that its devices using say Mail as the example also facilitate connectivity to several competitor software endpoints for instance I have my Outlook and Office email accounts tethered to push to my device Cutting off all external connectivity would be detrimental to retention as well as forward adoption but cutting off one point of connectivity Im not sure would be as harsh to device usage considering the lack of Apple device users willingness to switch devices based on Apple retention data as many would speculate Of course I could be completely wrong That said I do think that the loss of access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>productivity suite software on Apple devices would incentivize users to consider consumer device alternatives to ensure connectivity at all times Again I acknowledge the risk of this strategy I think that replicating is different than commoditization as a standalone strategy Replicating would mean that Apple create something substantially similar from a software standpoint this likely would include small changes to devices as well for instance the installation or pivoting to a standard control function dashboard inclusive of CTRL FN ALT SHIFT and then commoditizing the product If there is no substantial shift in learned behavior or standard operating procedure of software I believe the switching cost of softwareproductivity suites is negated In fact OpenOffice has long been a surrogate for Apples operating system and device users who prefer to have the familiarity of a Microsoftlike platform With switching cost being the greatest friction provider to the adoption of Apples software and with AAPL having what I deem as superior devices in spectrum and in specifications I believe this too is a realistic and viable option should Apple consider it While this is complete speculation I have to believe this is taking place behind closed doors at Apple Refocus in this context means focusing efforts on shaping the actual software as it did with the productivity suite upgrades announced to better meet the needs of the enterprise For instance particularly lowhanging fruit might be an optimization of FaceTime for enterprise usecases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>recently upgraded Skype to have a Skype for Business capacity that should have it competing with Google Hangouts for videocalling market share This in my opinion is going to be a key enterprise market and platform to win for those looking to lead the productivity suite space Apple could presumably update FaceTime to leverage a device advantage But Apple in all its creativity and innovation Im sure has many upgrades and fixes planned that Im sure will do just what Ive proposed for FaceTime Still I did want to note that a refocus of priorities or a parallel focus of priorities from all consumer to that of consumer and enterprise would be a great launch pad for market share take We wont know for a while who eventually wins out as the SMBenterprise leader but this race is sure to have plenty of twists and turns along the way Hopefully as often competition does it leads to much improved overall tech and capacity for those of us depending on these solutions to drive business outcomes Normally I think it would be safe to bet on Apple to be the winner of any contest it takes seriously That might be the case here as well But there is no denying the Microsofts incumbent advantage afforded to it by its software In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and please feel free to disagree in the comments section has an easier route to spatial dominance in that I believe it can take smaller less risky steps to upset the competitive dynamic in taking device market share But again I could be wrong We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
