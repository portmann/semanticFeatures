performance is mind boggling Stronger than any other company with sales above billion Apples stock is cheap as it trades at a discount to historicals Focusing on the huge amount of free cash flow results in a great deal of upside The company has numerous ways to continue growing At current valuation not much has to happen for investors to profit Apple NASDAQ AAPL announced results and beat expectations both on top and bottom line The press release can be found here the conference call transcript here as well as excellent summaries from SA News Editor Eric Jhonsa here and here In this article I will discuss annual and quarterly performance as well as product trends growth opportunities and valuation Take a step back and assume you didnt know this was Apple What would you think of their results What would you think of a company that went from single digit quarterly sales growth last year to double digit this year At the every least these are numbers that would satisfy any investor Annual Over the past year sales grew by vs and in the prior two years Operating profit grew while EPS grew Gross margin was while operating margin Quarterly This quarter sales grew yearonyear while operating profit grew and EPS Among the four quarters of this fiscal year this quarter was the slowest AAPL is trading at a PE of x If we take any of the below earnings growth figures we see that the PEG is below Yahoo Finance next years EPS growth If we target a PEG of and look at the lowest estimate of growth then the PE of x results in a target of The year average PE and average PS is x and x respectively Using these and numbers we come up with and Using the mid puts a target of It should be noted that in the Russell AAPL has the highest growth among all companies with revenues above billion This somewhat confirms the conference calls statement that Apples one year growth was greater than of companies in the Fortune Hence with such growth the market could rerate it higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT trades at a PE of x despite only growth in sales a decline in EPS and a Bloomberg estimated growth of During the company generated billion in free cash flow According to Bloomberg the WACC is Assuming zero growth and calculating a perpetuity we come up with a stock value of If we put in inflation then the value rises to So essentially if the company doesnt grow and just continues making the iPhone and selling new models to current owners then an investor still makes a profit Below we see the product breakdown by revenue numbers of units sold average sales price and percentage change Apple sold only m units in compared to m units in The iPad is in decline as both products and price dropped year on year but is that really a surprise With the size of our current mobile screens most people dont need a tablet In my personal experience households own several phones but only tablet That tablet is usually used by the kids to play games or watch videos As a father of two I use the tablet to keep my year old preoccupied so we can eat during dinners out Friends who now have larger screen phones are doing the same The Mac has not done badly as it sold a record number of units with a growth despite the difficult PC market According to the conference call the global personal computer market contract by based on IDC estimates From personal experience I have seen Macs pop up here and there They obviously are not flying off the shelves but it looks like some people who are not tied down to Windows are trying them out So some growth in Macs but a decline in iPads Is Apple a one trick pony I answer that with a resounding NO Again Id like to express my personal experience with the companys products My first purchase was an iPod classic which I still use in the car Although iTunes needs some getting used to and is something Apple needs to work on I was very happy with the ability to carry all my music around As I had used various smartphones from the old Nokias and Sony to the a few android and windows phones I decided to check out the iPhone and bought the iPhone After around years of usage the phone still works like new Its simplicity is genius I am too busy and dont have the time to mess around any more as I did with my androids Perhaps Im getting old but to me its more important that it works well rather than if it has all the new bells and whistles and offers maximum flexibility My third Apple product was the Airport Express I had problems setting up an access point at my house and for some unknown reason after a while the dlink and Belkin I tried would lose the connection I spent hours on this to no avail So in comes the airport express Zero problems since plus I upgraded older Yamaha active speakers by connecting to the audio available on the express What I am getting at is that Apple has proven that not only can it produce new products that are highly desirable but they are also high quality Yes Steve Jobs is gone but Tim Cook has been at Apple since And Im sure there is an entire team there to get the job done Investors and the public have an unprecedented high bar for Apples new products When an Amazon product flops no one makes a big deal out of it but for Apple every product has to be a blockbuster I believe we all need to give Apple some room China iPhone sales rose yoy in the mainland with being firsttime buyers According to the CC this occured in a smartphone market that contracted excluding the iPhone Android users of iPhone buyers made the switch iPhone upgrade program keeps current owners and attracts new ones China stores currently with a target of stores by mid Apple Music movies and iBooks now available The lower growth of the Chinese economy is not affecting Apple at all according to the call Its a nonevent for Apple China iPad It was the first tablet for of Chinese purchasers For of those it was their first Apple product iPad customer satisfaction is at This could help sales of the Pro along with Apples cooperation with IBM This could mean that the iPad sticks around for much longer than expected According to the CC there are over Macs within IBM and are added each week Each Mac saves IBM due to lower support cost and better residual value If this is all true then we could see more Macs elsewhere Apple Music m accounts of which m are paying customers Apple Watch no breakdown but the growth in sales of other products was thanks its growing contribution Now sold at almost locations in countries As improved Watch OS are released and new Watch models we will see a higher uptake of the product among consumers Put your prejudice aside and look at the big picture Apple has had monster growth and is working hard to continue growing It may not be at a year but more importantly it doesnt have to be for investors to make money The valuation is too compelling to avoid Personally I have already held a position twice
