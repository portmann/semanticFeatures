class='textDiv'>Apple Car Lets Hope Motor Trend Is Wrong Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Motor Trend has revealed a design exercise meant to represent where Apple might go with an electric vehicle Motor Trend is showing how poorly it understands Apple After teasing a possible insiders look at an Apple NASDAQ AAPL Car what Motor Trend actually produced was some very creative speculation If Apple actually produced the car the panel of experts at Motor Trend envisages it would be a disaster Investors neednt fear that Apple is so stupid The Motor Trend MT article betrays the usual misconceptions about Apple and its products MT assumes as do many that Apple is all about style over substance That Apple has succeeded on the basis of its product design Fads change market interest shifts and poor Apple is getting left behind by the relentless commoditization of the smartphone Therefore MT focuses exclusively on design coming up with what it thinks would be Apples approach Something groundbreaking in a superficial way a sleek futuristic scifi car such as you might see in The Minority Report The interior is even worse a bare cartoon with impossibly uncomfortable seats This isnt even a reasonable depiction of Apples design approach Yes Apple likes sleek and functional designs but it also willingly adopts design conventions of proven worth The Apple Watch is a good example Apple went for a fairly traditional watch form factor as opposed to something more radical such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Band The automobile is something that continues to evolve under the pressure of the needs of energy efficiency safety and manufacturability Teslas NASDAQ TSLA designs represent probably the best current compromise for the fourdoor sedan So the Model S and basically look like fourdoor sedans Theyre handsome sleek but not radical design departures I would expect something similar from Apple but I dont really want to dwell further on design because I think this was a completely misplaced priority on the part of MT MT gives almost no thought to the critical elements that could be discriminators for the Apple car its propulsion system and AI based selfdriving capability There can be little doubt that Apple is working on a car the socalled Project Titan Besides the myriad rumors and automotive industry hires the best evidence for the scale of the project is in Apples unprecedented real estate shopping spree which is the talk of the Valley Apple is already nearing completion of Campus II the spaceship which will add million square feet of space and accommodate on the acre site To put this in perspective Teslas Fremont plant the old NUMMI facility occupies a acre parcel with a million square foot main building As large as the spaceship is apparently it isnt enough for Apples future expansion plans As shown in the map below Apple has acquired numerous properties by purchase and lease in and around Cupertino SunnyVale and San Jose Among those is a large acre swath in San Jose just north of the San Jose International Airport which is approved for up to million square feet of office space The Mercury News estimates that as of late last year Apple had leased or bought enough office space or land to accommodate million square feet of space considerably larger than the spaceship or even Teslas main assembly building One of the Sunnyvale properties was listed by the city managers office as an auto testing center As reported by Apple Insider many of the properties go by code names borrowed from Greek mythology apparently in keeping with the Titan code name Finally Apple was widely reported to have interest in an autonomous vehicle test facility in Concord CA last summer While Apple clearly anticipates even more expansion and that expansion appears to be massive and automobile related none of the land purchases appear to rise to the scale necessary for an actual automotive production facility This leaves a major unanswered question in how exactly an Apple Car would be produced A year ago in my article Apples Electric Vehicle Opportunity I pointed out that there is actually a fairly large market for highend premium vehicles worldwide According to KPMG research the premium market segment annual revenue in is estimated to be billion If Apple captured of that it would acquire revenue of billion This definitely moves the needle For fiscal Apple had revenue of billion One central problem for Apple is profitability The experience of Tesla operating its own factories must be chastening Apple management has a profound aversion to losing money Even if Tesla manages to achieve profitability that in itself might further discourage Apple Tesla would have gotten past a lot of learning curve and be that much further ahead Im even more convinced than I was a year ago that Apple needs a manufacturing partner for an Apple Car This is the approach that fundamentally solved its margin issues with its computing devices Preferably the partner would have global manufacturing scale and presence in low labor cost manufacturing regions such as Mexico and Asia I continue to regard Magna International NYSE MGA as the best fit for this Magna does contract vehicle assembly work for a number of automakers and has numerous auto parts manufacturing plants The other central problem for Apple is offering a meaningful discriminator compared to Tesla Its been pointed out that EVs are becoming like the smartphone in the sense that they represent closely integrated software and hardware computer processors and operating systems This would seem to play to Apples strength in hardwaresoftware integration and it does But this only gets Apple the price of admission to the competition Apples systems integration expertise doesnt provide a discriminator compared to Tesla In the same way that Apple invented the modern smartphone Tesla has invented the modern electric vehicle Tesla has already created the connected car with overtheair software updates and autonomous capability Apple has systems integration experience Tesla has EV systems integration experience Tesla is the pioneer whereas Apple would be playing catch up If the car as iPhone doesnt offer a sufficient discriminator what does I believe Apple would have to offer a truly disruptive and breakthrough technology in either of the key areas ignored by the MT article propulsion systems or AI AI is less likely Apple isnt actually that strong in AI although it naturally has the resources to catch up Autonomous vehicle systems such as Nvidias NASDAQ NVDA Drive PX provide a hardware platform but theres still much work to do in software development Once again it appears that autonomous capability is going to be a minimum requirement that just gets Apple into the game rather than providing a discriminator That leaves propulsion systems and this is where I think Apple may have something to offer In fact I consider it likely that Apple has some technology in electric energy storage that it assumes will be a discriminator What that technology might be is open to question It could be a breakthrough in battery technology or something along the lines of a fuel cell as I have previously written about Although Apple is clearly very interested in and probably fairly committed to an Apple Car Apple must fulfill the key requirements of finding a manufacturing partner and offering sufficient technical discriminators in order for the project to move forward Anyone can come up with a cool design The fact that MT thinks thats a necessary and sufficient condition for Apple shows how ignorant it is not merely of Apple but of the technology businesses and competitive landscape that has developed in Silicon Valley I continually see analysts underestimating the level of competitiveness and technology being deployed by companies such as Tesla and Apple The recent successful landing of a SpaceX booster on a floating moving barge in the middle of the ocean is very instructive This is Elon Musks other company and it achieved something that had never been done before The technical depth required for that is something that most in the media dont seem to get That technical depth is on display in Teslas automobiles making Tesla Apples chief rival as well as the yardstick by which Apples efforts will be measured Its a very high standard even for Apple Apple wont enter this market unless it can offer something truly remarkable This makes an Apple Car something less than a done deal but Im still hopeful I dont think Apple would be making the huge investments its making if it didnt have something to offer And if Apple enters this market its probably the traditional automakers more than Tesla which have something to fear I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
