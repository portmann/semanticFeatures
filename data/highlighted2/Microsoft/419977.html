COMEX has a literal monopoly on gold futures trading volumes worldwide but very little physical gold is actually exchanged between COMEX trading participants More and more this environment feels like late early when the economy was in collapse but stocks held up on hopes that the Fed could maintain the bubble Fair wages for the workers This is more than an expression of social justice It is the only recipe for economic prosperity Those are the facts Its irresistible enticing and addicting And as Newscom reports its available hours a day all over the world to billions of people Facebook beckons to users seemingly with a twoprong approach both the pressure and pleasure to post We share stories photos triumphs and tragedies It is ingrained into our daily lives so deeply that studies show people check Facebook on average times a day With all those eyes all over the globe dialed in and the purchasing power available the online giant has tapped into a controversial delivery of data into its intelligence gathering It all starts with something that you may not even realize is enabled on your phone A littleknown feature deeply embedded in Facebooks privacy settings is causing users to think twice aboutnot just what they write but what they say As TheAntiMediaorgs Clarice Palmer explains The debate over Internet privacy and the responsibility social media companies should carry in protecting user privacy never ceases to spark controversy among both users and tech insiders But while Facebook one of the most popular social media networks struggles with accusations of news suppression and even fraud a new report on the networks microphone settings is reigniting past fears of surveillance that were never fully addressed According to University of South Florida Professor Kelli Burns Facebook is a huge part of the lives of smartphone users Due to this widespread addiction Burns explains Anytime youre using your phone any kind of information that youre putting into your phone looking at on your phone Facebook can access that But details regarding what youre doing or what youre browsing while on Facebook are not the only type of data the Silicon Valley giant can access The social medias microphone feature which can be enabled by the user via Facebooks settings is also listening A few months back a Facebook user took their concerns over the microphone settings to Reddit The post quickly went viral prompting Facebook to issue a statement on the matter According to the social media network the company does not record your conversations Instead the statement claimed if the user chooses to turn the microphone feature on Facebook will use your microphone to identify the things youre listening to or watching based on the music and TV matches were able to identify If this feature is turned on its only active when youre writing a status update But According to ABCs WFLA Burns might have been able to prove Facebook isnt telling the whole story behind this technology Kelli enabled the microphone feature and talked about her desire to go on safari right down to her mode of transportation Im really interested in going on an African safari I think itd be wonderful to ride in one of those jeeps she said aloud phone in hand Less than seconds later the first post on her Facebook feed was a safari story that seemed to pop up out of nowhere Turns out it was a story that had been posted three hours earlier And after mentioning a jeep a car ad also appeared on her page This test the news organization contended demonstrates how Facebook picks up buzz words in order to show that particular user ads and posts matching their interests The fact the professor made those comments after turning the feature on may serve as an example of how easily Facebook can trick users into giving the company access to their private conversations Though Facebook claims it does not store or share user information the very existence of the technology may give hackers including governmentbacked security experts a reason to explore private data further putting the privacy and even safety of Facebook users in danger Whats more concerning about this issue is the companys previous association with the US National Security Agencys PRISM program which gave federal agents access to users private data including emails photos and instant messages among other things While Facebooks more recent claims concerning user privacy regarding the microphone feature might be legitimate the companys former cooperation with NSA officials could indicate the feds may seek to explore the microphone feature whether Facebook agrees with them or not Smart TV manufacturers like Samsung have recently been forced to publicly address privacy concerns after news broke the technology was listening to users conversations As the same users learn Android Smart TVs may also present vulnerabilities that give hackers the ability to record what they do other members of the tech industry like Facebook might also face growing obstacles and skepticism from users In contrast though Apple has aligned with the federal government in at least one case the company was widely praised for standing for privacy rights in a legal standoff involving the FBI over the San Bernardino shooters iPhone But unlike Apple whose hesitation regarding lobbying practices has earned negative attention from Congress in the past Facebook has a relatively cozy relationship with Washington Whether this relationship is mutually beneficial to both parties and whether Facebook will respond like Apple has remains to be seen But MarketTickers Karl Denninger rages further demanding an answer to how is this legal the articleFacebookappears toconfirmthat it does indeed use your microphone which meansit listens to and uploads the contents of speech and other soundaround youwhen you are using the app Explain to me if you would why youdever allow such a device in your pocket Further please explain to me exactly why youbelieveFacebook would only use this for ad targetingwhen there is literally nothing to prevent them from doing otherwise And finallyplease explain why this is legal and Facebook and its officers are notundercriminal indictmentparticularly when you consider thatpeople other than youmay well speak within the listening range of your microphone and whileyou may have given consentthey did notand further they had no idea they were being recorded So you want to have a conversation with me eh Well I dont consent to being recorded and in many states including Florida unless said recorder is either openly and notoriously present and thus obvious giving me the clear option to refuse to talk to you in its presenceor you have my consentits a felony to make that recording in any situation where Ireasonably believe Im not being taped or overheard Oh by the way theuse to which you put the recordingis immaterial it isnot legal in this state to do so for purely advertising purposesany such use is unlawful and in fact it is a felony in this state Heh Zuckerpig your ass ought to be indicted for this crap and Florida is not alone in criminalizing this activity And finally here is a media design professor exposing how his Facebook provacy settings were opted back in without notice or consent schatzi Yes We Can But Lets Not PM Alan Sarah Peter and Jud huddle close to each other in the middle of the room That anyone thinks any of these devices are secure is laughable The device itself is the problem not the serviceappwebsite <span style='background-color:

carefull with monitoring your privacy settings Now where is that old copy of XP Agreed I will never use this shit spyware allowing detail of my personal life to be vacuumed into the archives of government agencies and big corporations That is insanely stupid A whole generation is going to learn the bitter lessons from this It is possible to get an account without FB but it is very difficultperhaps other companies have a similar policy Deleted Facebook account in Joined Facebook never deletes you account Your data is there forever httphedgeaccordinglycomfacebooksmarketcapisnowbilli big data supports facebooks multiple Could one write a script to generate millions of fake user accounts with tons of irrelevant data in them to swamp facebooks data analysis systems Would such a thing be of any value It says a lot about those who still have an account Either they are oblivious to the overreach of power and abuse or theyre too naive Same way they look at the government The entire site is a living breathing social experiment The same people who dont deactivate their accounts when abuse occurs are the same people who wont stand up to their government when similar things happen Most Americans are either scared uninformed or indifferent Think for one minute why would Facebook be free to me unless I was what was being sold to others Facebook thrives upon fake accounts Since it generates revenue by selling clicks to advertisers the more fake traffic is manufactured the more it can charge for sales that never materialize Many of the abnormal ZHers will pass judgement on your activities in REAL life and you will scorned unless you say End the Fed enough times why not just take her out a few times make her laugh then get her in the sack if she says no move on I ended up losing my virginity to that chick but it all fell apart which was probably for the best because last I heard she ODd on cocaine Plus she only had of one kidney to start with You had immoral sex with a drug adict on Facebook Boy you are as bad as some of those people it is very difficult to cancel a FB account Took me one half hour of web searching to find method of deleting account and thenf the account is still active for days Emergency Ward NTaREALmerican PM ThirdWorldDude Emergency Ward PM Your comment touches upon something that very few know and that is that MaoCommunist Chinawas advised controlled by a cadre of JewsKhazarians Look it up LIU The thing is when one steps outside their brainwashing and dons an intellecual pair of RoddyPiper glasses the world become much less confusing even predictable Just last night I found out that the quite Unconstitutional HUAAC was actually created by JewsKhazarians in They desired to use it to target those that were resisting the Khazarians use of unions and other schemes to destroy Goy businesses like the Disney Company They would use the committee to label those that resisted them as as Nazis and antisemetic LIU I propose Taylor SwiftIm sure shes a very good curb stomperI have a sixth sense for these sort of things Protocols Our kingdom will be an apologia of the

may be no development of abuses of this right Im glad to know that if any of those libs read or listen to what I propagate they will be reprogrammed A Try not to have facebook Its hard not to as most people use it as a way to keep up with family and friends who have moved away without having to actually communicate with them but its mostly better to not just have one However if you must B Dont EVER download the phone app Its awful Its slow It installs cookie trackers on your phone It hogs memory and battery usage And it bypasses most ad blockers unless you know java Its essentially malware If you have to use FB on your phone use it via browser C If using on a browser after your session ALWAYS log off Use incognito mode Its annoying as shit but FB as long as you are logged in will track every single cookie you visit so that its adcontent system can target you when you use the site God knows if they are keeping this dat and who they are givingselling it to D Dont ever link your main phone number or your main email to your personal account Use burners People can search you if your phone number or email is linked to your account This is obv different if you are using FB for page for your business youd in that case want FB to be setup for people to find you E Lock your account so only your friends can see pictures and posts Restrict as much public visibility as possible via
