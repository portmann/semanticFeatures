our portfolio has already reported and as there usually is around earnings season there were some good and bad reports Gilead NASDAQ GILD and Apple NASDAQ AAPL were hit especially hard after reporting earnings with both companies down more than in one week This oneweek loss puts both companies with yeartodate losses in the double digits Ouch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT also had a rough week losing almost after reporting earnings For the year the company is down more than Rounding out our top five laggards for the year Boeing NYSE BA and Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX are down and respectively Do sharp losses in a short amount of time provide a buying opportunity Stay tuned On the flip side some of our holdings reported good or not as bad earnings and have seen their share prices rise since the first trading day of the year Aflac NYSE AFL which we bought more of just last month is up more than for the year Realty Income NYSE O continues its strong year rewarding us with a gain Oil giants Chevron NYSE CVX and Exxon Mobil NYSE XOM have both gained more than this year helped in part by the rise in the price of oil ATT NYSE T has been a top performer all year and continues to maintain a position in our top five leader board rising so far this year Overall our portfolio dipped slightly in April and we are now up for the year including dividends The SP is up just over While Im most concerned with dividend income it is nice to see that our portfolio is beating the broad general market As previously stated we have made an adjustment to our stock purchasing criteria In addition to using Morningstars fair value and SP Capitals twelvemonth price target and fair value we are now including FAST Graphs in our analysis I will compare the companys current price to earnings ratio to its fiveyear average to see how overvalued or undervalued shares currently are In a previous article which you can read here I discussed what to do when a companys share price has a sharp decline because their quarterly earnings were not as good as expected In that article I gave a price target for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft

total portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is very close to being a full position and I will most likely not add more shares to the holdings After this purchase <span

VZ and Visa NYSE V We dont own a lot of companies that pay dividends this month but April has historically been very good to us in terms of the amount of income we receive from our holdings In fact this month has been our second best month ever in terms of dividends received Our dividend growth for the month is up and compared to the same time period in and respectively The dividend growth has slowed slightly but that was expected Previous months yearoveryear dividend growth was astronomical and couldnt be sustained forever For the year dividend growth is up and when compared to and Companies that paid us dividends for the month of March are Coke Altria Philip Morris Realty Income General Electric Cisco and JPMorgan Many of the companies in the portfolio have had a rough earnings season This has caused many companies to have sharp drops in share price This has provided buying opportunities and we were able to add to our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>position Since the company still has long term growth ahead of it as well provides a steadily increasing source of income the price decline gave us a chance to add a quality company at a reasonable valuation Having a price target helps take the emotion out of large price drop Dividend growth continues to power higher This is important because these dividends will provide the income needed to cover our expenses in retirement April was our second best month ever The snowball effect of a steadily rising income stream shows that we are on the right path towards retirement Disclosure
