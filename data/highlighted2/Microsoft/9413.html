Seeking Alpha In spite of the low market share of Windows phones Nadella is still hell bent on competing with Samsung and other Android OEMs The Lumia can steal customers away from Android One and Samsung entrylevel phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now a freemium company that doesnt care about hardware profits It wants to acquire the most amount of mobile users I previously discussed Nadellas tactic to put custom Windows ROMs inside Android phones I was wrong to presume that Nadella will lessen Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT focus on Lumia hardware this year The release of the Lumia says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still fancy itself as akin to a miniApple NASDAQ AAPL with a mobile hardwaresoftware ecosystem business model I still believe that selling Lumia phones is not the best way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to improve the market share of Windows phones However I am now convinced that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>makes so many billions of dollars from Android patent licensing that it can easily afford a price war with any Android handset maker The IDC chart below reveals that there were only million units of Windows phones that got shipped out last year a meager improvement over s numbers This weak performance is in spite of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>taking control of Nokias phone business last April In great contrast there were more than a billion units of Android phones that got shipped out last year a yearoveryear increase Those million units of Windows Phone salesshipment were also from Microsofts own Lumia brands Microsofts phone hardware sales last year were around million units In my opinion Nadellas willingness to come up with a Windows phone could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>catch up with No global vendor LG Electronics NYSE LG which shipped out million smartphones last year Pricesensitive buyers in Asia and other emerging markets will find a Windows smartphone that can run regular Windowsspecific software and games as a better buy than a LG F Android phone Samsung OTC SSNLF is still the no in smartphone sales and if it wants to remain so it might also join <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in selling Windows phones Perhaps Samsung could get a better revenue sharing deal from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>than what it makes right now from its Android phones Xiaomi the Chinese startup who managed to dethrone in Samsung in China last year has already cozied up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The reason why Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android keeps getting bigger in terms of market share is that Android phone manufacturers are engaged in a racetothebottom pricing strategy There are now gazillions of sub Android phones from major brands and whitebox manufacturers in China However a Windows phone is prima facie evidence that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still desperate enough to join the racetothebottom fight over smartphones Sub Windows and Windows smartphones could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>double its Lumia sales to more than million units this year I repeat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>rakes in tons of nocost money from licensing its patents to Android device makers like Samsung and LG Electronics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can outplay any phone manufacturer in a price war It will take some time but as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>keeps coming up with super affordable smartphones Windows phones could eventually hit million unit sales per year The issue that OEMs might find it hard to support Windows because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still hellbent on coming up with super cheap Lumia smartphones has been addressed by Windows custom ROMs OEMs could still continue making Android phones and the buyers themselves will just decide if Windows would offer them better privacy and services than what Google offers now The razorthin or zero profit margin on a smartphone is a nonissue because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has already upgraded its mobile business to a freemium model Increasing market share is not about hardware profits It is all about getting the most eyeballs for mobile advertising and sales of appsgames Selling phones at less than cost giving away free Windows ROMs to Android phone users free games free Office subscriptions cloud storage and Navigation systems are all just to hook more users in to the Windows unified mobilePCCloud ecosystem Free software to entice users away from AndroidiOS duopoly Super cheap hardware to win the next billionplus smartphone users in emerging markets Data mine the users browsing shopping mobile time spent Pricesensitive buyers in emerging markets will likely prefer a Lumia over a Android One smartphone Sub Windows phones could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gain entry to Chinas lucrative mobile advertising industry Mobile advertising giants Facebook NASDAQ FB and Google are still banned in China Look at the chart below from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Nadella needs a robust Windows mobile environment like what Apple and Google enjoy right now The mobile phone is central to the success of Microsofts overall business plan Free Windows ROMs and cheap Lumias could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>penetrate the million pair of advertising eyeballs in China Research firm eMarketer already estimates that China excluding Hong Kong will spend in mobile advertising this year Windows s coming this summer The potential addressable market of Bing search advertising Cortana Skype and other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cloud services now also includes hundreds of millions of people using pirated Windows software It is easier to persuade people to click advertisements than force them to buy a Windows license I strongly reiterate my Buy recommendation for MSFT Nadella might just deliver the speculation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could be the next Apple success story in mobile Eleven other highlypaid
