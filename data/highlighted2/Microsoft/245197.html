NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts businessproduct strategy tends to change very gradually but any major change is a huge step for a company that has such a conservative and deliberate culture The changes being made to the revenue model product strategy and corporate culture while incremental have created solid top line trends in the commercial segment While its hard to understand the continual ramp in commercial revenue the feasibility of ongoing growth can be supported due to three factors of growth The three main growth drivers the transition from perpetual license to subscription more revenue per head new services complementary revenue streams emerging market growth new customers These three factors have created a stable and predictable pattern of growth which is why the stock is trading at a premium to future earnings and outperformed the SP As many of you are well aware Ive been on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT fanboybandwagon for quite a while In fact Im an Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL fanboy and love the products that these three companies produce even when theyre pitted against each other However its worth noting that Microsofts productmanagement style is very conservative when compared to the aforementioned peers Therefore its worth noticing the discrepancies in strategy when compared to prior years as these minor changes to productexecution while minor talking points for analysts are major changes for an organization as large and conservative as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has outperformed the SP this year I know what youre thinking and yes this actually happened This pattern of outperformance for an old tech company is both uncommon and hard to comprehend However after taking a closer glimpse into Microsofts financials conference calls quarterlies and investor conferences I arrive at the conclusion that the yeartodate performance is substantiated by outward fundamentals In other words the market is pricing in a rather robust growth phase The momentum trade seems to be substantiated by enough observable evidence hence the high conviction from both buyside and sellside analysts The CFO Amy Hood went into greater detail on the internal dynamics of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or the inner workings Again the company doesnt participate in a broad range of product categories Well actually yes they do But what often goes unnoticed by the investment community is the incremental pricing tiers that come as a result of new products and updates The refresh to some of their more obscure apps gets ignored as do the incremental revenue opportunities of nascent business categories These things do matter but it has become difficult to articulate these ideas Enterprise facing apps products and services are not a fun or hot topic for the average investor Not only is the business model difficult to understand but the material is extremely dry However before continuing the discussion on incremental opportunities its worth highlighting some other key points The analyst at the UBS conference asks Hood a series of good questions which I will highlight throughout the course of this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will go through a transition from a license model to a subscription model You will be hybrid for a while How long does this exit make that shift over Brent John Thill UBS analyst A different question There is a technical this is a weird one There is so much of our enterprise business thats always been subscription when you think about it in terms of how well the accounting construct was So moving from a perpetual subscription to a cloudbased subscription doesnt look any different So the PL that does have an impact in that way The only place is the cleanliest is our Office Consumer business because we purely are a perpetual business recognized at upfront Two of our businesses are really in business subscription and I think weve talked about that transition and we finally went to place this quarter we got a tailwind from the subscription as opposed to the headwind for the perpetual change Amy Hood CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The key takeaway from this discussion is that the subscription mix of enterprise differs from consumer office apps So on the consumer side we as analystsinvestors see a minor headwind upfront because the shift from subscription has a slow revenue ramp as opposed to perpetual licensing However the tailwinds from completely turning over the commercial portfolio to pure subscription has resulted in positive pricing mix thus driving revenue over the short and long term This is because a good chunk of the portfolio was based on subscription anyway So if you transition the commercial business to layer on more additional services and charge more per annum on the service updates Microsofts recurring revenue stream increases due to serviceproduct additions along with a mandatory update Therefore the commercial business has done better in terms of transitioning from perpetual to subscription as opposed to the consumerfacing business Now the consumerfacing business has had a slow transition from office perpetual to office subscription So up front you see a slower shift in the cumulative revenue stream In the initial stages the transition on the consumer side is a headwind to sales because consumers are slow to upgrade and many are in the initial months of their subscription It takes a year or two for the subscription to generate incremental revenue above the average perpetual license rate Therefore the transition to subscription revenue on the consumer side has been a minor headwind but is longterm accretive to sales and earnings This positive impact to consumer office will become much more noticeable in the FY and FY time frame The UBS analyst goes on to ask another important question at the conference Just go into some of the segment lines on Personal Computing its your largest business as a percent of revenue The margins will fluctuate around and I know your maybe aptly focused on costs And so when you think about the opportunity and efficiency where do you think the biggest opportunities for you on the Personal Computing line for improving the efficiency of Brent John Thill UBS analyst What I think about is whats the most efficient way to run the business we have chosen to be in and how can we do that better everyday And the OEM business I would think quite different way right about efficiency Efficiency there is taking three or four operating systems teams on the OpEx side putting it on one team and having them effectively work better That is both more efficient and far less costly We have a logical ecosystem interface through the store to universe labs And so I tend to think about why where there is a peer group that makes sense and then there is also the why and then if you manage those things you frankly find it far easier to have culture change on costs because people know why they are doing it Amy Hood CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The key takeaway from this discussion for investors is allocation and consolidation The company believes that it can consolidate smaller teams into bigger teams to solve larger programming issues or create more scalable products Of course its not always the case that bigger teams create better results but if you scatter developers too far apart you end up creating various walled gardens that prevent interaction amongst employees that are essentially working on the same task In that instance consolidation of teams does make sense However separation into smaller teams also creates other advantages as it creates more autonomy thus sparking creativity The trend has been to spread developers into smaller teams so they can focus singularly on tasks despite the various overlaps which then allows for spontaneous innovation Apple likes to separate teams to create an essentialist culture that focuses on specific product enhancementsissues and then consolidates it up to the higherlevel developers to integrate all of those changes Of course this type of approach varies based on situation and whether it makes sense to create walled gardens for developersdesigners to compete among each other or to guard information by limiting the individual engineer exposure to new product designs and road maps However in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>consolidation makes more sense because they only have one major software version thats released over a several year period Therefore collaboration on these large scale projects requires a collective group knowledge as opposed to a series of smaller development iterations which tends to work better when the task is divided amongst separate smaller teams When you combine a large group of people together the decision making tends to be much more conservative because broader consensus tends to dictate the direction of a new product or update This is probably why Microsofts incremental advances in software and hardware are more conservative and deliberate So unlike Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may not necessarily or more like accidentally happen upon some new discovery However they do have the capability to handle large scale engineering tasks like universal apps or OS continuity On the other hand Apple tends to compound their engineering efforts with miniadvancements every year and the progressive improvements build quickly upon each other In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>punches with each major update and Apple tends to launch a series of jabs which can snowball into a major knock out The final big takeaway from the investor conference Yeah If you could just walk through how you think about whats happening the impact of E coming I think in December Brent John Thill UBS Analyst Its in the price list in December Lets talk about Office in general I continue to expand the definition Its why we didnt say reinvent Office The ambition is not to reinvent Office The ambition is to reinvent productivity of business processes We are adding new things to the umbrella we call office And thats analytic its security And the third pillar is voice And so when you think about that those are a very new TAM market for us very large extension of what our sales force knows and does quite well And so when you can take effective sales force with good relationship and add modules if you think about it The selling relation we can do so reasonably efficiently not a tonnage of marginal cost but a ton of marginal revenue opportunity and those are good for us when you think about the logic of extensions Amy Hood CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>So that last statement requires some deciphering and background knowledge But basically what Amy Hood is trying to communicate is that by introducing new pricing tiers by launching new services at higher price points they gain the advantage of new market opportunities while also operating out of a sales model thats uniquely tailored to their direct sales organization This approach creates more revenue at lower operatingmarginal unit cost Its easier to price up a subscription pyramid than to separately market new software and services As an enterprise customer you could weigh the costtobenefit easier when comparing product tiers as opposed to separate SKUs From Microsofts standpoint it maximizes sales and increases the interest from buyers without having to expend more resources than necessary on marketing The new E tier for enterprise also was confirmed for listinglaunch in December in that last statement I believe E offers a plethora of new software thats pertinent to various verticals Windows IT Pro painstakingly analyzes the incremental advantages of the E tier But for sake of brevity the E tier highest enterprise tier set to be launched next month comes with a plethora of bundled software advantages The E plan will come with a more advanced version of Skype conferencing additional analytics features within Power BI Delve organizational analytics workforce and productivity enhancement and security advancements eDiscovery Lockbox Data Loss Protection Safe Attachments Now Im not going to delve much into the specific capabilities of E when compared to other tiers However the key takeaway The marginal revenue potential from higher tier subscriptions creates upside to financial models The three dimensions to generating more revenue you sell to more customers sell at a higher price for that given product or service or sell an additional product to that customer Since the enterprise market is quite mature its hard to find new customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has already maximized pricing for demand so selling at an even higher price seems unlikely The final option to generating more revenue is to then sell to the same consumer an additional product or service and thats where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is focusing their energy The incremental sale of additional softwareservices adds a new dimension to revenue growth Expansion into emerging markets creates new customers Finally the transition to a subscription model increases the pricing per unit These three areas are being worked but also is obscure to the vast majority of investors It seems growing at lowteen rates in the commercial segment defies the law of large numbers But when analyzing the individual components for top line growth I come away with a more conclusive picture It seems that Microsofts commercial segment can grow at a steady pace for quite a while longer Its not just the perpetual licensing shift to subscription or macro fundamentals in emerging markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a threepronged strategy for addressing enterprise growth and its why investors are bidding the stock so aggressively despite the high market cap Were slowly transitioning into a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>growth phase And based on the current valuation the market thinks this trend has meaningful legs So now you know why Im a fan of <span style='background-color:
