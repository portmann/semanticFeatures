fantasy sports is a natural extension of YHOOs digital vertical and I expect YHOO to become a meaningful player in this space Options on YJapan growth in digital assets and daily fantasy all point to the positive direction Remain bullish on YHOO Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO delivered an inline revenue and EPS that fell shy of consensus estimates The weakness in display ad and search revenue was largely expected by the market in my view What I believe is more important are YHOOs digital and mobile growth the potential option of the Yahoo Japan stake and what I believe to be an overlooked area fantasy sports I believe that YHOO provides shareholders with attractive call options with its digital assets and monetization of its fantasy sports assets Remain bullish on the name Consolidated revenue of b was inline with consensus while EPS missed by Display ads decline of was a further decline from Qs and it appears that YHOO continues to lose pricing power in this area with price per ad down while volume was up Interestingly search revenue also fell down by suggesting that Mozilla may not be YHOOs only search savoir The recent restructuring of the <span style='background-color:

important product for FB and its m clients see Yahoo Q Preview Potential TieUp With Facebook In short I believe Qs weakness was largely expected and that the market should not punish YHOO and focus on the growth of the digital assets which I believe will be a bigger part of YHOO going forward Yahoos entry into the daily fantasy sports vertical is a natural extension of its fantasy sports business which has traditionally hosted seasonlong fantasy games Judging by the growth of FanDuels and DraftKings each valued at b I expect YHOOs fantasy sports to be as equally successful as the leading players given YHOOs longer operating history and user base While I acknowledge that the daily fantasy sports industry has been bubbly over the past several months with hundreds of startups coming online to capitalize on the fantasy sports market there are an estimated over m fantasy sports participants in North America That said FanDuels and DrafKings only account for of the total user base which suggests plenty of room for YHOO to leverage its existing fantasy player base and fantasy news source which are critical to participants when they select their lineups While management did not give much color on the specifics we can expect YHOO to have a launch by this summer and I believe YHOO can be a formidable competitor to FanDuels and DraftKings on both PC and mobile fantasy sports YHOOs digital assets continue to go gangbusters YHOO clocked in mobile MAUs an increase of yy More impressive is that Tumblrs monthly active viewers are inching closer to m with an expected m in revenue for this year Engagement remains strong with qq growth and I see this to be accretive to Tumblrs longterm growth Video stream growth of suggests that YHOO like most of the other video platforms is also benefiting from the ad dollar shift from TV to video While monetization may not come in as soon as investors had hoped I sense that YHOO will continue to move towards the right direction Remain bullish on YHOO on the back of growth in digital assets potential search partnership with FB ramp up of daily fantasy sports and additional clarity on the Yahoo Japan asset Source
