the company came to prominences in the s when it manages to double total assets under management starting in for six years in a row In it acquired the Templeton Galbraith Hansberger Ltd founded by Sir John Templeton But the success of the business is by investing worldwide in particularly Asia where growth is the fastest There you have it five businesses that beaten Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway to the punch bowl or is it What set these companies apart from their competition There are several traits found in these companies that led them to worldwide success these are Being in the right industry The rise of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>coincide with the rise of the personal computer in the s Just like the automobile was going to replace the horse the personal computer was destined to replace the outdated typewriter Being a distributor of innovation Why risk your money on RD to create the next big thing when you could be a distributor Best Buy the largest electronics retailer in the US by distributing electronics that sells It differentiate itself by having knowledge staff and great customer service Be the center point for social gatherings that was the mission of Starbucks By designing your cafe like a persons living room and accepting everyone youre likely to be a success Taking advantage of economic policy changes the deregulation of financial services was the big economic story in the s also made famous in popular culture by the movie Wall Street Charles Schwab took advantage of these changes by recognizing this huge growth momentum The rise of the emerging economies a country with a per capita of per annum is likely to grow faster than a country with per annum So it is common sense to invest in emerging economies and capture some of this fast growth That is what Franklin Templeton Investments have done and the returns from its stock price speak for itself All these companies had greater returns because they were smaller than Berkshire was So a smaller business with a recipe for success would grow much faster in its initial stage of development When Buffett took over Berkshire Hathaway between and the stock was purchased at an average price of share and over a period of years it rose to share which worked out to be return Investing in the SP index would return in that same period The best way of measuring returns from Berkshire and comparing it to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or a Starbucks is to use compound returns Here the table On that basis the comparison is more fairly accurate However some of these businesses could still be classified as a growth company whereas Berkshire is maturing meaning slower growth If we measure Berkshire stock returns in the period from where theyre in the growth phase the compound annual return comes to But does that mean the five stocks beating Berkshire is void due to unfair comparisons and useless for the retail investors Being an investor is about discovering the next great story For example Berkshire was growing at its fastest between and it would be wise to dump the stock and reinvest the profits into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Franklin Resources Inc That would put your portfolio always in the growth phase On the next section I will explain why it is hard to choose winning businesses Picking stocks like a Starbucks or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can be a fluke On hindsight it is easy to pretend Starbucks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are winners today But back in the early days how many investors were backing these businesses to succeed and sustain its success over a period This is why picking a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock in its early inception period is a fluke for the ordinary retail investor unless you know Bill Gates and his close associates Here are some obvious obstacles to picking longterm winners The level of competition picking the right company from the competition is like finding a needle in the haystack The business cycle some sectors are more cylindrical than others The mining sector being obvious this makes longterm success almost impossible to maintain There are other winners the glory isnt dominated by one person or entity sometimes there are tens or hundreds of successful businesses from the same industry The problem is picking the ones that will earn you the higher return for your buck Sustainable business or a fad knowing which businesses would still be around for twenty to thirty years time can be tricky So we should be focusing on businesses with longterm solutions not quick fixes Companies business model or products swallow up by rivalsnew entrants sometimes we see a business doing well until a rival or new player stole their business When Apple launched the iPhone it revolutionizes the mobile phone industry Names like Nokia NYSE NOK Motorola NYSE MSI SonyEricisson and Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY struggled to compete with Apple entering its market In the next section I will talk about the strategies for picking winners even when they are newcomers Here is how retail investors can pick winning companies like Buffett Despite the odds being against you there are certain company characteristics you could identify that could make them a success The best way to approach this is to read about successful companies in the past and identifying these characteristics which makes them the best in the business
