However, it's not exactly clear whether Yahoo would sell ads via its Gemini platform or through Google Double Click.Ad networks have lost some leverage in response to programmatic ad bidding, which is another level up from the bidding networks that aggregate some of the web ad-inventory, but not all of it.So, the various silos aren't the most cost efficient, and when you reach the level of programmatic it's similar to an open exchange for commoditized ad-units across the entire HTML and mobile-based web.It's pretty exciting stuff, but it's not yet clear whether Yahoo's Gemini can secure more favorable rates or if it's just another network that's bound to get consolidated into the broader industry wide consolidation of ad inventory.For the most part, the stock has been on a persistent down trend and whatever Yahoo does on the Search front isn't material enough to move the stock in either direction.This is driven by the overwhelming value of the Alibaba stake that will soon be spun off to shareholders.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the most part, the spin-off will add value, and while a recent scare indicated that a tax-efficient spin-off would not be feasible, the rumors ended up being rumors, and there are various alternatives, according to a Reuters report . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What really hemorrhaged value over the recent weeks has been the persistent decline across Chinese equities, and while one could argue that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) is a stalwart among Chinese stocks, and doesn't trade on a Chinese exchange, there's no denying that confidence issues pertaining to asset values could negatively impact e-commerce volume across Alibaba's portfolio of web properties. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore, consumer confidence does matter in this context given the sheer scale of Alibaba and the fractured nature of commerce in China. (Uncertainty) </span>That being the case, I'm not knocking on Alibaba, but until Yahoo is able to spin off the value from its Chinese assets, it's hard for Yahoo's financial performance to be measured from incremental victories like in the case of the renegotiated Yahoo and Bing partnership.I will be very interested in Yahoo following the spin-off because I think it will unlock the intrinsic value of Yahoo core when it's floated separately on the Nasdaq.Needless to say, I'm still bullish on Yahoo and I'm a long-term bull on Alibaba.I think a deal with Google will be a win for shareholders but will spark concerns over Bing's growth.Yahoo only has 10% of search market share in the United States.Of that, Google would only get half of the queries and Google would receive a small portion of Yahoo's profit from search.Therefore, the deal isn't going to generate substantial value for Google shareholders.However, adding some of the market value from the remaining queries on the Internet plays to Google's core strength as a search provider, so the marginal revenue from Yahoo would not come with much marginal cost.So from an economics standpoint, Google would generate some value - it just doesn't move the needle by much given the company's sizable revenue base.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source: Google And Yahoo Search Partnership May Add Shareholder Value Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
