offer up to of search queries to Google which will give Yahoo a blend of Bing and Google search results This type of deal should get past regulators and is a healthy alternative to developing a compelling search algorithm inhouse Of course incremental victories like this will not impact the stock by much given the disproportionate value of Alibaba Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO could be looking to ink another search partnership This will add value for both Google and Yahoo shareholders Google will gain more search query share and will get a portion of Yahoos digital revenue However Yahoo can lower its RD cost and provide a broader mix of search results There have been times in the past where Yahoo and Google worked together I think it was circa where Google first approached Yahoo with its search technology and upon implementation from Yahoos homepage it became widely known that searching the Internet rather than looking through the Yahoo directory was more efficient Fast forward a couple more years Yahoo had realized that it made a huge mistake and attempted various largescale acquisitions to be at the forefront of search and dropped Google from the homepage By it became excruciatingly obvious that Yahoo was never going to catch up and a couple years later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT came banging on the door with merger papers Of course Yahoo was never taken private as the top executives over at Yahoo barricaded the front doors and engaged in backoffice corporate warfare with Steve Ballmer yeah the former CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>who now owns the LA Clippers Couple years after that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Yahoo came to terms on a deal circa This was after Yahoo attempted to make a deal with Google circa but was blocked by antitrust regulators and various advertisers who were opposed to a fully completed monopoly between the two providers Of course Yahoo was struggling on the back of falling engagement and the lack of investment into search technologies so a quick fix was to piggyback off Googles universal search algorithm which was deployed circa Google invested substantial resources to develop universal search and today we dismiss the technology as a nice to have It was what pivoted Googles dominance across news maps and various other web based apps So we fastforward to and now Marissa Mayer who is the current CEO of Yahoo and a former Google exec whom presided over the Search Unit is looking to work together with Google rather than compete directly with them Like they say history doesnt repeat itself but it sure likes to rhyme Yahoo confirmed on Wednesday that it has begun testing the use of Google search ads for a small portion of its desktop and mobile web search results As we work to create the absolute best experiences for Yahoo users from time to time we run small tests with a variety of partners including search providers the company said in a statement There is nothing further to share at this time Yahoo got the right to work with other search providers in April when it renegotiated its partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>whose Bing search service had been the exclusive provider of search results and ads to Yahoo under a year partnership between the companies From my perspective its not exactly clear weather Yahoo will actually get a deal done or if its just testing the level of engagement with Google queries in comparison to Bing and its own inhouse search algorithm assuming it has one When you reach the scale of Yahoo even a marginal improvement in engagement is enough to generate millions of dollars in incremental revenue and earnings Furthermore websites tend to focus their search engine optimization efforts on Google because its the most dominant search property in the world Therefore retrofitting Yahoo Search could add value to Yahoo shareholders while lowering costs so Yahoo can focus on developing other web properties or pass those savings onto shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends Whats interesting is that Yahoo can feature a combination of Google and Bing search queries on its Yahoo Search page Based on the recent deal restructuring with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Yahoo can use of its queries with other search partners which will address the stipulations of the various laws governing antimonopolistic practices However its not exactly clear whether Yahoo would sell ads via its Gemini platform or through Google Double Click Ad networks have lost some leverage in response to programmatic ad bidding which is another level up from the bidding networks that aggregate some of the web adinventory but not all of it So the various silos arent the most cost efficient and when you reach the level of programmatic its similar to an open exchange for commoditized adunits across the entire HTML and mobilebased web Its pretty exciting stuff but its not yet clear whether Yahoos Gemini can secure more favorable rates or if its just another network thats bound to get consolidated into the broader industry wide consolidation of ad inventory For the most part the stock has been on a persistent down trend and whatever Yahoo does on the Search front isnt material enough to move the stock in either direction This is driven by the overwhelming value of the Alibaba stake that will soon be spun off to shareholders For the most part the spinoff will add value and while a recent scare indicated that a taxefficient spinoff would not be feasible the rumors ended up being rumors and there are various alternatives according to a Reuters report What really hemorrhaged value over the recent weeks has been the persistent decline across Chinese equities and while one could argue that Alibaba NYSE BABA is a stalwart among Chinese stocks and doesnt trade on a Chinese exchange theres no denying that confidence issues pertaining to asset values could negatively impact ecommerce volume across Alibabas portfolio of web properties Furthermore consumer confidence does matter in this context given the sheer scale of Alibaba and the fractured nature of commerce in China That being the case Im not knocking on Alibaba but until Yahoo is able to spin off the value from its Chinese assets its hard for Yahoos financial performance to be measured from incremental victories like in the case of the renegotiated Yahoo and Bing partnership I will be very interested in Yahoo following the spinoff because I think it will unlock the intrinsic value of Yahoo core when its floated separately on the Nasdaq Needless to say Im still bullish on Yahoo and Im a longterm bull on Alibaba I think a deal with Google will be a win for shareholders but will spark concerns over Bings growth Yahoo only has of search market share in the United States Of that Google would only get half of the queries and Google would receive a small portion of Yahoos profit from search Therefore the deal isnt going to generate substantial value for Google shareholders However adding some of the market value from the remaining queries on the Internet plays to Googles core strength as a search provider so the marginal revenue from Yahoo would not come with much marginal cost So from an economics standpoint Google would generate some value it just doesnt move the needle by much given the companys sizable
