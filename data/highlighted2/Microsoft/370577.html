#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Last year marked the th year of the streaming media industry Few are aware of the role that RealNetworks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>played in growing the industry and helping to foster the adoption of streaming media content marked the th year of the streaming media industry and for many who werent around in the early days of the Internet the history of how the streaming media industry started isnt a story they know Fewer still are aware of the role that RealNetworks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT played in growing the industry and helping to foster the adoption of streaming media content thanks to their deep pockets and marketing muscle in the late s If you didnt work in the streaming media industry during that time period you would have no idea just how fierce the battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and RealNetworks really was Words cant describe how competitive the market was at the time or the amount of advancements that took place in the industry within a twoyear period You really had to live through it and be working in the industry during the early years to appreciate it So for those that want a history lesson or want to relive the old days heres how it all started Progressive Networks is considered by many to have started the streaming media industry with their launch of RealAudio in April of While they ushered in the era of the early days of the industry with audio only streaming they werent the only company at the time working on streaming technology Others including Vivo Xing VDOnet VXtreme and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>were also developing their own platforms Xing which had an MPEG tool suite at the time launched their StreamWorks platform which supported not just audio but video as well just after Progressive Networks So while many want to point to just one company that founded or started the industry the fact is that no single entity or person deserves all the credit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was already working on video technology as early as when their video for Windows development kit was sent to developers that year Microsofts video server technologies originally code named Tiger because it sliced data into stripes for storage led to its innovation in streaming media and was first demonstrated in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>tried to provide the answer with My TV <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Interactive Television or MITV for short but aside from the catchy acronym MITV didnt have much going for it Progressive Networks spent more money and had an aggressive expansion plan and out executed everyone else Progressive Networks got all the traction in the market and quickly became the default platform in the industry Progressive Networks radio webcast on September between the Mariners and Yankees is considered by most to be the first major live sports webcast on the Internet but no one truly knows who did the first webcast Some say it was the Rolling Stones concert in November of over the Mbone but others disagree Frankly it doesnt matter There were a lot of very smart people working on audio and video technology at the time that helped contribute to getting the industry off the ground But Progressive Networks rightly deserves a lot of the credit and was the primary company responsible for the wide adoption of audio and video streaming with content owners and consumers from to In October of Progressive Networks launched version two of their platform RealAudio and pretty much owned the entire audio streaming market at the time Then in September of they launched RealAudio with the help of Sheryl Crows single If It Makes You Happy This ushered in the era of good quality music streaming as well as Microsofts entry into the industry In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made an investment in VDOnet a small company with some Internet video broadcasting technology acquiring a stake in the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>then launched version of their own player called NetShow in conjunction with the launch of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Internet Information Server at Internet World A year later in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced a licensing and standards development deal with Progressive Networks and made a minority investment taking a ownership in the company For a short time it looked like both companies were going to work with one another on streaming media protocols and technology but their partnership would soon fall apart In August of just two weeks after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced their deal with Progressive Networks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>purchased VXtreme a small audio and video startup that was Progressive Networks number one competitor at the time Founded in with Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Informix Software as investors VXtreme had a line of Internet video products including Web Theatre Server LiveStation and a Web Theatre Client plugin for Netscape and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>browsers Adding VXtremes technology to Microsofts streaming platform really gave them the foundation they needed to begin to challenge Progressive Networks which changed their name to RealNetworks in September of and went public in November later that year Also in RealNetworks announced a new broadcast network in a deal with MCI that layered RealNetworks software on top of MCIs Internet backbone with the goal of being able to support up to simultaneous streams This was the early incarnation of what would later become RBN Real Broadcast Network and was the first major effort to try and bring video to the masses via a dedicated content delivery network The company also announced the fourth version of their platform in RealNetworks which saw the debut of RealVideo and only a few months later released RealSystem adding support for Macromedia Flash RealNetworks still dominated the market with more than radio stations using their platform and announcing more than M users of their software By the end of things in the industry had started to change Companies realized that streaming media technology and the services that went along with them including encoding delivery and hardware was going to be a real business Vendors like Sun Cisco and others latched onto the streaming market with hardware that others needed to deploy and use platforms from RealNetworks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Technology that was once only thought of as low bitrate poor quality audio streaming was now being applied to video centric highbandwidth Kbps applications The race in the industry was now on and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>decided they wanted a piece of the pie and would start to aggressively compete against RealNetworks As rolled around the streaming media market really started to mature and big business was now at stake After Microsofts acquisition of VXtreme <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>used their new technology and really started directly competing against RealNetworks with the launch of NetShow in mid Bad blood between the companies soon ensued RealNetworks CEO Rob Glaser accused <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>of purposely taking measures to break RealNetworks RealPlayer software in order to stifle competition In July of after a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on competition in the software industry which Rob Glaser testified at accusing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>of unfair practices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>sold their stake in RealNetworks saying that the companies would go in different directions By now the battle was on RealNetworks added to their technology portfolio and acquired Vivo in March of and a month later launched RealSystem G Reals new platform was a complete rearchitecture of their system and provided support for RTSP SMIL JPEG and GIF VDOnet fell on hard times and after their CEO resigned the company laid off employees and closed up shop In July of Citrix NASDAQ CTXS acquired VDOnets assets and came out with a product called VideoFrame which failed less than a year in the market This left RealNetworks as the still dominant force in the market in but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was starting to get traction Later that year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>put a ton of money marketing and man power behind their audio and video platform hired a lot of employees and went after the media and entertainment market that RealNetworks had always owned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>started closing deals and getting content owners to use their platform in addition to RealNetworks and this was the period of time in the industry when many content owners started making their content available in both RealNetworks and Microsofts formats It was the first concrete sign that RealNetworks domination of the market was being challenged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also got a big win later that year when they foot the bill to have President Clintons grand jury testimony streamed in their format for many of the major news websites By the start of streaming media usage exploded and really became mainstream when on February th of Victorias Secret did a live webcast of their annual fashion show The video window wasnt much larger than the size of a postage stamp and the frame rate and buffering was terrible But viewership numbers released after the event were in the millions and even though many complained about the poor quality live streaming was here to stay and was about to be catapulted into the stratosphere Later that year another largescale live event NetAid brought even more exposure to streaming media industry when Cisco pooled together many vendors in the market to try and bring the event to a worldwide audience Then when Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO bought Broadcastcom for B the deal cemented the enormous expectations people had for where everyone thought the streaming media industry was headed In April of RealNetworks acquired Xing Technology and in October <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>renamed their platform Windows Media Microsofts strategy of bundling their Windows Media Server software with their Windows NT Server as opposed to RealNetworks approach of making large companies pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for it was starting to pay off The service provider I worked for at the time Globix paid for a RealServer software license to be able to support simultaneous streams and then on top of it had to buy servers at least until Linux came along In some cases Windows Media Server deployments inside CDNs at the time cost less than RealServer to deploy As a result some content delivery networks started charging content owners a premium to deliver content in RealNetworks format versus Microsofts Content owners started rethinking why they should spend more money to deliver content using RealNetworks platform when Microsofts media server elements encoder and player software was all free <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really ramped up their marketing that year and even brought out Bill Gates as their keynote speaker at the Streaming Media West conference in December of to highlight the use of digital audio and video as the next major wave of Internet computing At the same time little known to anyone outside of a small group of industry insiders throughout and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had been quietly giving content delivery networks and webcasting production companies millions of dollars in what they called net credits The idea was that these vendors could go to content owners and tell them that they would convert and host the customers content in the Windows Media format and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would pay the cost usually for the year The service provider I worked for at the time got hundreds of thousands of dollars in net credits in just one year and larger CDNs like InterVU iBEAM and others got millions This was the peak of the streaming media industry late with lots of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>dollars flowing into the market which helped many of these vendors like InterVU build out their network for scale Only a year later InterVU would be bought by Akamai NASDAQ AKAM in a stock swap valued at roughly billion and Microsofts net credit dollars was a big reason for InterVUs growth While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and RealNetworks competed with one another both companies really had a different strategy and vision for their platforms Microsofts primary interest wasnt in defeating RealNetworks as a formatplayer its real motive was in containing licensing costs for codecs Taking the then license for MP and MPEG and including those technologies in Windows was going to cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as insane million per year of top line revenue Had RealNetworks established their own codecs as the defacto standard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could have been forced to license RealNetworks technology for even more money It cost far far less for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to buy a codec company and spend a fortune developing an ecosystem then it did to take these licenses Another big difference was that unlike RealNetworks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>didnt care as much about their player it was created to make Windows better It was considered a Windows component and important but much of the development effort went into the server format and codecs RealNetworks was much more of a frontend company and the main thing RealNetworks cared about was their player and the revenue from it Everything else they did was designed to support their player which was evident by the fact that even though RealPlayer was free there was also a plus version that came with more functionality but cost users In at the crest of the Internet bubble RealNetworks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>both came out with newer versions of their platforms and worked hard to out maneuver one another with more features and functionality RealNetworks also announced they had more than million regular users of their RealPlayer While it looked like that nothing was going to stop the growth of the streaming media industry and the progression of the technology cracks in the market were already starting to show The streaming market and entire Internet industry for that matter was soon headed for a fall that would take most vendors by surprise Companies that had raised millions and in some cases billions in venture capital werent growing revenue as fast as many had predicted Some companies had no real revenue or business plan at all and never should have been invested in to begin with Most vendors werent anywhere close to turning a profit with some losing hundreds of millions a year Companies tried to grow too big too fast and assumed that market growth rates would exceed their own growth numbers but they didnt RealNetworks saw what was coming but like many didnt think the impact would be so severe As RealNetworks CEO said in a letter to shareholders in the underlying drivers for the change in our financial results are not trivial but the company felt the impact of these changes would only take several months to work through They and others were severely wrong In reality the industry had been setting itself up for failure by setting financial expectations and guidance that vendors had no shot of reaching Many originally dismissed this as market growing pains because they were blinded by greed a wave of exuberance and were sacrificing growth over profits They wanted to believe all was well But in late the unrealistic and selfinflated numbers finally started to catch up with the majority of companies in all Internet sectors and investors took notice For many the money was gone and funding dried up as investors begun to realize they were on the losing end of tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars The dot com bubble burst caused the loss of trillion in the market value of companies between When the larger Internet bubble burst it trickled down into every segment of the market including the streaming media industry Content owners that were rushing to get all their content online quickly realized they had no way to make money from it and started to pull back Advertising dollars dried up Some vendors literally closed their doors overnight and started going under at the end of but it was really that it all fell apart Even larger companies like Cisco who had a legitimate business felt the pressure with their stock losing of its value in a short period of time For the majority of the vendors in the streaming media industry it was all over Those vendors that did survive really scaled down their operations and stopped spending money cutting costs anywhere they could By my estimate at least of all the vendors in the streaming media industry went out of business between late through the end of To put it in perspective at the Streaming Media West trade show there were over exhibitors on the show floor When the show was started back up again in there was a total of exhibitors In March of RealNetworks announced a threeyear deal with Major League Baseball to create a subscription service including live audio webcasts While it was the biggest premium content deal in the market at the time and important for the progression of the industry it came as the market was crashing Only four months later in July RealNetworks laid off of their employees as their revenue from server licenses to companies that had gone bankrupt and advertising revenue started to disappear fast Contracts went into default companies couldnt collect what they were owed and many vendors had to lay off employees RealNetworks quickly tried to change their business model and source of revenue by starting a content subscription service called RealOne which they launched in December of A month later they had paying subscribers but it wasnt enough Seven months later in August of RealNetworks did another round of layoffs this time of their company closed selected offices and canceled their annual user conference By now the battle between RealNetworks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was almost over as the market for video services on the Internet literally disappeared New content wasnt going online and no major improvements to streaming media technology was being developed The industry was at a stand still In RealNetworks introduced their Helix initiative along with their Helix Universal Server and released substantial parts of the source code under an open source license But it was the end of RealNetworks as an audio and video platform Between RealNetworks lost of their revenue from software license fees and of their advertising revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>came out with Windows Media in September of and it offered better quality than Real was free as part of the Windows platform and had the tools and ecosystem that content owners needed It was at this time in the industry when the market shifted and it was no longer about codecs and formats Helix was the last major software release for RealNetworks which then got into the music business including a partnership with Sony NYSE SNE later that year and launched one of the first major efforts to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet In the following years RealNetworks acquired music services and gaming companies and was out of the streaming media platform market And just like that in less than months arguably the most important company responsible for the growth of the streaming media industry was no longer in the market they started But that wouldnt be the last the industry would hear from them In RealNetworks filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for anticompetitive practices for amongst other things bundling their Windows Media Player with the Windows operating system and bundling its mediaserver software with its server operating system Two years later in October of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>settled with RealNetworks agreeing to pay a million upfront cash payment to resolve all damages claims and gave RealNetworks longterm access to important Windows Media technologies that enhanced Reals media software solutions RealNetworks is still around today but gets most of their revenue from games and other sources of online content and software By Microsofts streaming media division which had been renamed to the Digital Media Division with over employees and fell under the Windows Platform team had served its purpose Windows Media streaming won out and as result Windows Servers had value over Linux And with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>being involved in codec development that lead to many patents and these becoming part of H <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>directly changed the pricing for H through years of effort As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could license it for Windows unlike MPEG which clearly helped the industry as a whole With the format battle now over the Digital Media Division was looking for new competitors and reasons to exist Enter Apple NASDAQ AAPL Apple had released iPod and iTunes for Windows and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was struggling to figure out how to compete The Digital Media Division owned this problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and came up with things like PlaysForSure to unite the industry in a nonApple ecosystem But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really did not have any good solutions on how to challenge Apple as this was a whole different type of competitor So post Vista <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>execs did not see entertainment and streaming technologies as core to competing with the resurgent Apple Streaming and codecs who cares we won and Macromedia and Adobe NASDAQ ADBE are not real competitors was the attitude of many inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>After much debate at the BallmerGates level it was decided that Robbie Bach head of Xbox would own the Apple compete problem since Apple was viewed as an entertainment threat not an OS threat and certainly not a threat to the Windows Mobile group With that mandate handover the Digital Media Division was broken up in late The devices folks and subset of Windows Media Player went to work on Zune but under the hardware device team from Xbox and codecs and DRM went to phone group Some also went to the tools team that was an offshoot group of net that became the Silverlight group to try to complete with Flash But as many who worked at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at the time would tell you when there isnt a competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>loses focus and Flash wasnt yet a threat While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>beat RealNetworks in the end years later Apple would beat everyone following the intro of the iPod and iPhone Adobe would then take over with Flash but even that became irrelevant with HTML and also lead to the death of Silverlight In the end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Real and Adobe would all lose out in the video formatplatform market twenty years after it started Its also worth noting that all of these video platforms would have gone nowhere if it wasnt for content Software wouldnt have driven downloads without nothing to listen to or watch Content has and always will be king While this isnt the complete history of the streaming media industry talk to any veteran of the space and they will tell you what the early days were really like Its hard to capture in words the excitement excess competitiveness and startup culture that existed at the time something the streaming media industry will never see again For me personally the twenty years have gone by fast and the advancement in the technology and adoption of streaming applications has taken far longer than most predicted But that hasnt stopped many people from continuing to try to improve on it every single day Heres to the next twenty years Note My thanks to the numerous former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and RealNetworks employees and execs that I interviewed for this piece and provided much of the details I had already forgotten Tagged Technology
