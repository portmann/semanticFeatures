#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Dell private since were two of the stocks that investors fell in love with during that era However those investors soon learned that loving a stock could have nasty consequences because it is difficult to part with something you love These stocks and many others were devastated in the ensuing months and years The unattached owners of these stocks disposed of their holdings as prices dropped or earnings failed to materialize These disciplined investors had predefined criteria to alert them it was time to sell The stock lovers lacked such discipline and went through various stages of denial justification rationalization and other emotions as they watched their beloved stocks sink lower and lower In the current market cycle its hard to imagine a stock that is more loved than Apple NASDAQ AAPL Back in it was despised and many analysts were not convinced the company would even survive let alone flourish Fast forward to it became the most valuable company in history in terms of market capitalization surpassing Microsofts December valuation Yesterday it was still the largest component of the SP Index accounting for of the Index However Apples stock price peaked months ago at On Tuesday it closed below and yesterday it closed below That is more than drop in months Apple released its quarterly earnings report which is the reason for the new downdraft Earnings fell short of expectations by coming in at per share which was cents below expectations and below a year ago Revenue fell by marking its first revenue decline in years and the first ever since the stock achieved darling status Apple also reported that iPhone sales fell for the first time in history Now might be a good time to ask yourself if you are an investor or lover of Apple stock It is already in a bear market so if you havent sold it yet then when will you sell it You didnt sell when it dropped and you didnt sell when it dropped What will it take A drop A drop Two quarters of declining revenue Many people are selling their Apple shares perhaps because it posted its first revenue decline in years or perhaps because its price dropped below Then again an equal number of shares are being bought Its a high volume day for Apple Im not predicting further demise for Apple stock as this could turn out to be a great buying opportunity What Im suggesting is that you objectively consider your criteria for selling Apple or any other stock Be sure to have an exit plan preferably before you buy As expected the Federal Reserve took no action at the conclusion of its FOMC meeting yesterday Analysts are parsing the contents of the press release so you can expect to see some forecast revisions for when the Fed will make its next move Sectors Signs of a
