have tried and failed to turn around their businesses These businesses include Nokia Blackberry and Intels mobile device segment The characteristics these businesses have in common include financial weakness uncompetitive products an unrealistic turnaround thesis and managerial dissembling about future prospects Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD fits a pattern of ostensible technology business turnarounds that never actually occur In this article Ill describe the characteristics of this pattern and provide examples from the recent past Ill also highlight the ways that AMD does and does not fit this pattern Since I began blogging about technology in many technology companies have been disrupted by new tech or more powerful competitors Often these companies attempt to stage a comeback and a thesis is presented to investors that a turnaround is imminent or under way In some cases Ive criticized the turnaround thesis as unrealistic based on my assessment of the financial condition and products of the companies as well as the competitive landscape These cases had a lot of features in common Financial weakness either the company or the business area involved had been suffering from revenue declines and was losing money Noncompetitive products Often the companies were once market leaders but their position had been disrupted by competitors with new technology Invariably the management of the company fails to recognize or acknowledge the noncompetitive nature of their products A turnaround thesis investors are told that some change or new product offering will turn around the fortunes of the company Often this is appealing precisely because the stock is cheap and there is a prospect of large percentage gains A dissembling management Often the management will dress up the turnaround thesis with dissembling about the true nature of the financial condition and market prospects of the company Losses are obscured with nonGAAP financial metrics Claims are made of sales momentum and market share gains Usually any revenue or market share gains are short lived and come at the cost of deepening losses Negative reaction to my position my critical articles of these companies have usually been greeted with a vituperative outpouring of personal attacks in comments Besides AMD I can think of three other companies that meet the above criteria These were Nokia NYSE NOK circa Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY circa and Intels NASDAQ INTC mobile device business circa In the late Fall of Window and Windows Phone had been released and Nokia under the leadership of exMicrosoft NASDAQ MSFT executive Stephen Elop had chosen to abandon its Symbian operating system in favor of Windows Phone The turnaround thesis was a simple one WP was a modern mobile OS that would revitalize Nokia sales Nokia began producing a line of Lumia phones featuring WP At the time expectations for Windows and Phone were very high but I contrary to prevailing sentiment was not impressed with Nokias prospects In a blog conducted by Motley Fool I wrote Myths of the Nokia Turnaround Although Motley Fool subsequently took down the blog pages the article can still be viewed via the Internet Archives In the article I took issue with Elops claim that Nokia had achieved underlying profitability a nonIFRS metric that ignored Nokias incessant restructuring I also called the purported success of Windows Phone a myth While Nokia managed to briefly grow Lumia revenue the Devices and Services division revenue continued to decline as the division remained unprofitable For Q I observed that Lumia was simply cannibalizing sales of legacy Symbian phones I also discussed the speculation about a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>buyout Given Googles experience with buying Motorola Im not sure why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would want Nokias DS division and Im sure that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is better off without it for the time being While trying to reshape itself as a devices and services business the task of managing Nokias devices and services business would probably be more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could handle Nokias Devices and Services division never achieved profitability and by the end of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had agreed to buy it Although the Lumia phones were billed as flagship devices they simply were not Clad in cheap plastic and featuring off the shelf processors they were steeply discounted from the beginning The pricing of the Lumias was a dead giveaway about their true stature in the market Even after the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>purchase Windows Phone continued to fail in the marketplace Windows Phone didnt fuel the turnaround of Nokias Devices and Services business It did just the opposite Although it seemed fairly obvious to me at the time what was happening with Nokia my articles were greeted with the harshest criticism Unfortunately Internet Archives didnt save any of the comments I received The reader will have to take my word that I was literally called an idiot and told that I had no business writing about technology or investing In the turnaround thesis was that the appointment of John Chen as CEO combined with new devices based on Blackberrys proprietary BB mobile operating system would restore Blackberry to smartphone preeminence In September I wrote Blackberrys Collapsing Ecosystem on Seeking Alpha acknowledging that Blackberrys declining revenue and losses had not deterred investors in the stock But I pointed out that in addition to its financial weakness Blackberrys overall user base was declining steeply Blackberry had posted a couple of quarters of unit sales increases but these were once again coupled to losses for the company As is so often the case the sequential improvement was cited as proof of the turnaround but I took issue with this on the basis of the overall decline in the user base The slight sequential improvements in hardware unit sales were not compensating for users abandoning the platform The very first comment I received out of is fairly representative of the reaction from Blackberry supporters I stopped reading at this part The continuing decline in BlackBerry subscribers combined with declining hardware and service revenue confirms that the BlackBerry ecosystem is collapsing I wasnt ignorant of the earnings release and Blackberrys user base continued to collapse Despite this Blackberrys management continued to represent that the turnaround strategy was well under way By December I called Blackberry the Drowning Man of Mobile I wrote The story of BlackBerrys supposed turnaround is always the same but becomes increasingly ludicrous over time BlackBerry has new products and services in the pipeline that will turn the companys fortunes around BlackBerrys enterprise customers will buy BlackBerrys hardware and services even if consumers will not Once again in Blackberrys management I perceived an element of dissembling in its representation of the turnaround But eventually it was realized that a new strategy was needed and that BB just wasnt cutting it Intels Mobile Device Business Beginning in Intel created a new Mobile and Communications Group MCG which gave investors visibility into Intels efforts in smartphones and tablets Too much visibility apparently By the end of MCG had accumulated a loss of billion Intel management had been trying to push a turnaround story in mobile despite being late to this market Intel was now determined to push its way in Since the losses didnt really work very well for the story Intel decided to obscure those losses by a reorganization that put together the PC group and the mobile group into a new Client Computing Group beginning in Once again we have the element of management dissembling regarding its weak financial performance in the mobile business In my assessment of Intels earnings report in January I pointed to Intels contra revenue policy as the source of the mobile device losses I also challenged the fundamental wisdom of strategy of selling its tablet processors at a loss Heres another example where the pricing of the product is symptomatic of its market weakness Throughout Intel virtually gave away its tablet processors for free But Intel was very proud of its increase in market share due to shipping million tablet processors in Intel pointed to this as a sign of its turnaround Often Intel supporters informed me that I didnt understand contra revenue that I overstated the mobile losses and that the turnaround was real But the turnaround was a managerial contrivance A year later I pointed out that Intel had capitulated on mobile devices If there was still any doubt about this Intel erased those doubts when it discontinued its Atom smartphone and tablet processors AMD is another example of a technology company turnaround story where the financial weakness of the company has in no way deterred investors As I pointed out for the Q earnings report AMD reported a yy revenue decline and an operating loss of million AMD makes its case for turnaround based on short term market share gains that once again come at the expense of revenue decline and unprofitability This should start to sound familiar AMD also makes the turnaround case on the basis of hopes for new products such as its Polaris GPUs and Zen architecture CPUs These are yet to be released but in the mean time the actual shipping products are very uncompetitive AMDs Bristol Ridge SOCs are fabricated on a nm process and are not competitive with Intels Skylake Even though Bristol Ridge is based largely on the previous generation of Carrizo processors according to Anandtech AMD management hailed Bristol Ridge as a new th Generation device when it was launched at Computex Once again we have the element of dissembling in the management of the company The question of how competitive the new Polaris GPUs will be is still open but the pricing of the GPUs as revealed at E is a strong indicator of lack of competitiveness For instance the low end RX will have a starting price of and the top end RX will be priced starting a When a company starts out offering new products at the extreme low end of the price range thats typically not a good sign The comments from AMD supporters on my articles have been uniformly negative but Ive come to view this as an indicator that Im on the right track In addition to the five key points of similarity with the other cases of tech decline there are additional factors that weigh against AMD In the other three cases at least the companies were attempting a turnaround in a growing market mobile devices particularly smart phones AMD is not even attempting to offer anything in the mobile space Instead its trying to grow market share in the shrinking market for PCs CPUs and GPUs for PCs This is not a strategy for growth but its the only avenue open to AMD Its not like AMD is going to come up with a with a smartphone SOC Even if AMD grows market share its likely to be smaller in absolute terms as the overall market shrinks That leaves the data center as the last hope for true growth but as I pointed out in my recent article on ARM servers I view x servers as a declining market in the long term AMD management has made it clear that they see their data center opportunity as being in x probably on the basis of the market reception to Seattle So x servers are just another shrinking market for AMD to try to gain share in And this is the crux of my problem with the AMD turnaround strategy Its a PCx centric strategy in an era of x decline And AMD continues to face much stronger and profitable competitors in Intel and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Repeatedly I see comments citing recent AMD stock gains as validation for the turnaround story I consider the psychology of AMD investors to be very characteristic of a herd mentality As long as the herd is buying AMD members of the herd assume all is well I think the herd is being driven into the slaughterhouse When will the slaughter occur Hard to say but probably by the end of the year Certainly not for the June quarter earnings report The release of Polaris on June will be hailed as a major victory despite the fact that Nvidia has had its superior GTX and cards available for some time and these are sold out almost everywhere AMD will almost certainly post another quarter of yy revenue decline as well as a net loss But the herd wont care I continue to regard AMD as a short opportunity I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Author payment page view Authors
