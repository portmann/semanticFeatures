stocks remain a favorite among investors Aside from a handful of select technology picks hedge funds are flocking to the financial sector So far in the technology sector bet by private investors has far outperformed the financial sector bet by hedge funds Recent hedge fund disclosures reveal surprising market behavior firms are reducing their positions in investorfavored stocks Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL Walt Disney NYSE DIS and Facebook NASDAQ FB Based on data published by the financial accountability engine TipRanks hedge fund holdings of Apple Disney and Facebook stocks currently amount to roughly and respectively These holdings together constitute the majority of US based hedge funds but the overall possession of these stocks has been significantly reduced by the firms More specifically for every two hedge funds that increased their positions in Apple last quarter three reduced their positions Disney and Facebook shared similar fates with a one to three buysell ratio among top hedge funds What could be some of the decision factors separating hedge funds from private investors Apple the worlds most valuable company has dropped dramatically to since its high of last April Based on simple metrics it appears that Apple is a good buy The PE of is very low compared to one of its largest competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT whose PE is Additionally Apple has a large amount of cash on hand approximately billion The cash continues to be a safety net for investors should Apples stock drop further Investors are comfortable knowing that the company can afford to buy back shares and increase their dividends in the future With its large and loyal user base Apple continues to dominate the smart phone market while capturing a whopping of the smartphone profits globally in despite its shrinking share of the market source Looking forward investors have the iPhone se to look forward to The se model has a smaller inch screen with the functionality and speed of the iPhone s At a lower price point and with a smaller screen Apple can increase their market share in developing countries like India and appeal to customers who prefer a smaller and cheaper device Despite the companys slowdown some investors remain attracted to the loyal customer base and higherend products that dominate the smartphone market While hedge funds are not as keen anymore to take a bite of the Apple Hedge funds seem to view the Apple case a bit differently It appears that Apple can no longer maintain the strong gains that it has made in the past years The highend smartphone market in which Apple competes is saturated and the iPhone is no longer a unique product but rather a widely owned device Without the vision of Steve Jobs some could argue that Apple has lost its direction and its ability to continually innovate The companys most publicized innovation of late is the Apple Watch which flopped in the face of sales estimates Lastly Apples push towards electric vehicles may turn off investors as the company plans to enter a market in which it has no familiarity or experience Most notably Carl Icahn s hedge fund dumped million in Apple stock in the fourth quarter Several other hedge funds followed suit including Larry Robbins and Chuck Royce On the whole over hedge funds either reduced their position in Apple or sold out of the company completely It appears that Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens might have given investors a glimpse into the future of Disney The film grossed an astonishing billion and helped Disney post a record billion in the first quarter of operating income This number represented an increase to the Studio Entertainment division for Q of Additionally the segments revenue increased to billion up from billion Fortunately for Disney Star Wars is not done releasing films and the potential to continue remarkable growth in revenue is realistic and even expected after the strong first film reviews and reception favorable on RottenTomatoescom Private investors have disregarded some of the trouble surrounding cable cutting and the loss of ESPN subscribers in order to focus on the more familiar epic fantasy saga and overall brand name Disney can continue to increase its bottom line with box office hits and revenue generated around its successful films toys licensing rights spinoffs and merchandise Hedge funds look beyond the recent Star Wars box office hit towards a darker force in Disneys future Some may consider Star Wars to be a BandAid on a cut that needs stitches While Star Wars was a smashing hit it only distracts investors from Disneys real problem ESPNs slowdown and a loss of subscribers Disney according to the NY Times has the highest level of fixed costs sports rights which can prove to be challenging if ESPNs bottom line continues to shrink The transition towards unbundling is threatening Disneys grip on the cable entertainment Companies like HBO and CBS are unbundling meaning they are breaking apart their packages and instead offering a monthly fee for select programing The unbundled program fees are cheaper than the large packages that Disney relies on and are shrinking Disneys market share In order to survive ESPN may have to follow suit but it appears that hedge funds want to reduce their exposure to this particular package Facebook continues to dominate as the worlds beloved social networking site With a portfolio including Instagram facecom WhatsApp and Hot Potato Facebookowned platforms are omnipresent Facebooks strong portfolio has helped position the company to expand and improve its already dominant products Surrounded by the many success stories and potential VR success with the Oculus Rift private investors are drawn to this stock Facebooks familiarity factor and the overall attractiveness of the technology sector can be a strong decisive factor pushing investors to pour money into the company Strong performances lead to high expectations Facebook has established itself as the leader in social networking but can it grow enough to justify its current PE ratio In the company had of online adult users on the website followed by in and another in In alone according to Frank N Magid Associates Facebook lost of its teen market share in The sheer size of Facebook may prove to be troublesome to maintain as the demand for new technology and features may outpace the companys ability to improve its products Facebook is losing ground with teenagers as customers shift towards using Snapchat and Twitter According to the Washington Post Teenagers are drawn towards erasable media ephemeral photos videos and comments which are here one minute and gone the next Facebook is operating in a fast paced and everchanging industry which proves to be volatile above everything else Given the volatility some may point to the fact that Facebook is overvalued The company has a very high PE of when compared to the industry average of The company has succeeded due to its simple and attractive user interface addictive products and huge user base but how long can the company continue to grow Can Facebook continue to grow ad revenue in the future How many ads can Facebook place on its website before users become completely turned off Will future generations use the site or will new trends threaten to take away the Internet Empire that Facebook has built While Facebook is performing well at the moment the company will eventually run out of steam and many hedge funds may not want to own the company when it does Twitter lost of its value and LinkedIn in the last year proving that unlike the banks technology firms are never too big to fail George Soros hedge fund may have already gotten wind of this as Soros Fund Management reduced its stake in the social media giant by more than half in the fourth quarter TipRanks quarterly hedge fund report the GuruPortfolio breaks down the top stocks held by hedge funds Data reveals very large investments in the financial sector Hedge funds currently hold a huge stake in Wells Fargo NYSE WFC in comparison to the measly and for Apple Facebook and Disney respectively Other financials starring in the top are American Express NYSE AXP JPMorgan Chase NYSE JPM and Bank of America NYSE BAC A few technology firms also managed to take a top position These are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>IBM NYSE IBM and Oracle NYSE ORCL Hedge funds seemed well aware of the imminent downturn and preemptively shifted funds to the consumer goods sector Making the top in the consumer goods category Kraft Heinz Company NASDAQ KHC CocaCola NYSE KO In the past it would have been easier to say that the hedge funds are likely in the better bet however for the last years the performance has shown them to be as lost as private investors Ultimately it is time to notice the growing rift between the hedge funds and private investors If the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates banks will be able to increase profits on loans and a strong shift from the technology stocks to banking stocks might take place With that said so far in the technology sector bet by private investors has far outperformed the financial sector bet by hedge funds Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL FB DIS I wrote this article
