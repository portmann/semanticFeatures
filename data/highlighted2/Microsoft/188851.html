which previously signed licensing deals with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may also quit paying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT negotiated a mutual dismissal of all patent infringement suits involving Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL At first glance this move might be seen as an act of surrender The original patent infringement suit was filed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>against Motorola NYSE MSI over its Android devices in October Motorola once a subsidiary of Google allegedly violated nine patents of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The negotiated settlement with Google now obviously endangers the lucrative multibillion patent licensing business of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>There are more than a dozen of Android device manufacturers that already agreed to pay for annual licensing fees Below is a partial list of Android OEMs that are paying annual licensing fees to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The suit against Motorola five years ago was obviously a fear factor that intimidated Android OEMs to just pay instead of facing Microsofts litigation lawyers Source Alcaraz ResearchFoss Patents The lawyers are not the only ones who are going to lose money on this settlement with Google For the near term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will also suffer financially from this deal If Google owner of the Android OS is now forever immune from paying Android licensing fees theres nothing preventing Samsung OTCSSNLF HTC Acer ZTE and other firms from asking a judge to dismiss any licensing agreement they previously signed with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>They could argue that Microsofts settlement with Google is indicative that its patents covering Android devices arent worth paying for Samsung the biggest vendor of Android devices pays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>more than billion per year just for patent licensing fees Microsofts capitulation against Motorola MobilityGoogle is a clear admission that it doesnt really have the right to force companies to pay licensing fees Im not a lawyer but as far as I know there is no such thing as selective patent licensing I therefore expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to quickly lose its billionyear of easy money from Androidrelated licensing fees The settlement with Google has an easy explanation This scenario was already on the horizon five months ago Digitimes April report revealed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was offering patent licensing fee discounts to Android OEMs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>dangled lower licensing fees if OEMs preinstall Bing Skype OneNote Office and OneDrive mobile apps on Android devices they sell I opine that Nadellas platformagnostic strategy to bring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>appscloud services in all devices is now more important than the billionyear patent licensing revenue He believes sacrificing the easy money from patent licensing is necessary to inspire more Android OEMs to preinstall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>mobile apps and services The Android OS ecosystem is too huge that manufacturers are already too dependent on it The upcoming commercial launch of the Windows Mobile OS is not going to make any company quit its Androidonly business Nadella is obviously not waiting anymore for Android OEMs to create Windows phones He just wants to infect their Android devices with a dose of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apps It might be his original intention all along to eventually eliminate all Android licensing fees just to gain the support of OEMs Paying zero Android licensing fee is certainly a great incentive for OEMs to preinstall Bing or Skype It is no secret that many Android manufacturers resent the added cost from paying licensing fees to <span style='background-color:

giving away free software and patents in exchange for peoples personal data The more people that use Microsofts freemium mobile apps the better chance there is that <span style='background-color:

information <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to also offer an allintrusive access to personal data so that advertisers would finally consider Bing Ads as an alternative to Googles hypertargeted ads Nadellas obvious sacrifice of the Android licensing fees is akin to a fearless chess grandmaster sacrificing a Queen to try and gain longterm positional advantage Theres
