NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>squandered more than B on acquisitions and failed products under former CEO Steve Ballmer When companies make paying dividends a priority it means less money to waste on other ventures Its not just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>under Ballmer most companies fail to generate high returns from mergers or stock buybacks When I meet with new clients and we go over my proposal for their portfolio I sometimes encounter a bit of pushback when I suggest investing a portion of their money in our dividend portfolio I think a lot of this stems from the misconception of dividend paying stocks as safe boring low growth companies for widows and orphans They want high growth stocks and think dividend investing is the antithesis of that Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT recent announcement of a B write down related to their acquisition of Nokia it got me thinking that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a great case study on why dividends are so important no matter what your investing goals are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a company that meets many of the characteristics investors look for The company earns high returns on capital and has lush profit margins due to its three powerful franchises the Windows operating system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office and its commercial software suite The company has enjoyed steady revenue and profit growth throughout the last decade Of course because of the sky high valuations due to the tech bubble <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock has not really been attractive until the later part of the last decade Also under former CEO Steve Ballmer the company was known for one thing wasting an astonishing amount of money on acquisitions and illfated consumer product launches Over the past ten years the company has Taken B in write downs including aQuantive in and Nokia in Lost B on Bing excludes write down of aQuantive accounted for above Incurred B in estimated losses on Zune Will be taking M in restructuring charges related to Nokia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has wasted over B of shareholder money on acquisitions and on failed products in an attempt to enter already saturated consumer markets that had no real synergies with the companys existing products or services This would have been enough money to give every current shareholder a special dividend based on B shares outstanding Thats about a yield based on Microsofts share price as of this writing It also would have been historically significant occurring a decade after Microsofts other special dividend of in Of course during the time period weve been discussing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been a dividend stock Over the past ten years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has paid out over B in dividends But could you imagine the damage Ballmer could have done if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>didnt pay dividends and he had a spare B lying around Its not just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>under Steve Ballmer that makes terrible decisions with shareholder funds A KPMG study found that percent of mergers were unsuccessful in producing any business benefits regarding shareholder value A McKinsey Company study no date given found that percent of all acquisition programs were failures because the acquisition strategies did not earn a sufficient return on funds invested Here are some other quotes about the dismal rate of success when it comes to mergers and acquisitions percent of mergers fail to achieve their anticipated value from the Weekly Corporate Growth Report and Most mergers fail to add shareholder value from Harvard Management Update Companies also like to tout stock buybacks as similar to dividends They are not A June study by Credit Suisse analyzed the T in stock buybacks by SP companies from to They found that only percent actually made money that is the company bought back stock and the share price rose above the buyback price Not too bad However only percent of companies actually managed annual returns of percent or more to their shareholders with their buyback programs In the real world letting company management spend shareholders hardearned money on stock buybacks or acquiring other companies is usually wasteful Dividends serve as a tried and true method for companies to return profits to shareholders and enhance their returns Dividends also help protect investors from management making poor capital allocation decisions which as we can see is shockingly prevalent throughout the corporate world By investing in companies that make paying dividends a central part of their strategy investors can minimize the impact of the Steve Ballmers of the world that is management that has poor capital allocation skills Source Why Dividends Are Important For Every Investor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Case Study Disclosure I
