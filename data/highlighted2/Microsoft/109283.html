It just makes more sense to lock a user in and not ask them to leave the room and come back.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe Amazon has moved into the Cloud Storage arena to try to do just that - app aggregate. (Uncertainty) </span>It already has the overlay platform/umbrella of services to have this make sense, it has the finances, the size, the integration expertise, and the market sway to make this a "new normal."Amazon wants to and should definitely pursue being the Bossa Nova in tech/Cloud Storage/user convenience.At least, if you're asking me, this is what Amazon wants to do.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I just have a hard time believing this bare bones app launch is the final product. (Uncertainty) </span>I think if Amazon does intend to unify the apps under its Cloud Drive, it would do well to look into replicating or simply outright buying SMB/enterprise solution startups ClipCard and Jumptuit .ClipCard and Jumptuit are both app aggregators and two of the finest I've seen in the private space.ClipCard has a unique Slack integration that's hugely useful to a massive user base that Amazon should want to attract.Jumptuit allows for file and content migration between services.I don't think I need to explain why that's beneficial and again hugely important.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I recently had a chat with ClipCard management after openly calling the company a commodity and making claims that it has no hope for monetization. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After a sit-down in which management opened up about the platform and walked me through some of the unique capabilities, I'm now convinced that the platform could stand alone. (Uncertainty) </span>And not just stand alone, do well for itself in time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think if Amazon wants to start somewhere, ClipCard is a great place to start. (Uncertainty) </span>Jumptuit has its benefits as well, although without a deep under the hood look at the tech, I can't say with certainty that Amazon would be buying anything defensible from the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still, a Jumptuit overlay on the Amazon ecosystem would be powerful and the sum of all parts outcome might be defensive enough to justify the purchase. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Valuations are unknown for both companies, but I can't imagine either is egregious this early into their development. (Uncertainty) </span>Amazon is in a position in which it shouldn't waste time developing tech - it should instead opt to buy; pull forward growth, pull forward development, and pull in users to the ecosystem.If the tech space has shown us anything of consistency, it's that once a user is in an ecosystem, it's really, really hard to pull that user out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Amazon could offer a unique, value-added service (even for free for a while if it should) to draw users from other easier to use or more familiar ecosystems. (Uncertainty) </span>Amazon has some great conveniences it offers via its ecosystem and an app aggregation service (tethered and based from a cloud storage obviously) would definitely draw the eye of the demographic it wants.Heck, it would draw the eye of a lot of folks.I think this is where Amazon is going with its Cloud Drive and now dedicated mobile apps.I'll be closely watching any further developments and update readers as they come along.Source: Amazon: Racing To Zero Or Racing To The Top?Disclosure: I am/we are long FB, AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
