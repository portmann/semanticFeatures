similarly huge integration with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT for its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office further confirms my speculation that Box is on the block as an acquisition target I recently opined that Box the polarizing ECC platform provider could be being looked at as a potential platform addition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in that Microsofts integration signals a concession of OneDrive market share It should also be noted which wasnt mentioned in my article that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also has a substantially similar integration with Box competitor Dropbox That said I believe this to only underline my speculation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has conceded its OneDrive market share Also that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is instead trying to first promote the take rate of its productivity suite while secondarily building a wish list for cloud storage and collaboration providers Now how is this summary relevant to the BoxIBM partnership With the BoxIBM partnership bringing the benefits of IBMs Analytics Social and Security tech to Box customers existing and new as well as the new ability to choose local inregion data storage on IBMs cloud platforms for international enterprise customers I believe Box is now significantly more attractive as an overall acquisition Along with these benefits the IBM partnership also will allow builders and developers to integrate Box APIs into enterprise apps and web services tethered to IBMs platform and existing Box customers will now be able to utilize Watson Analytics for contents stored via Box Again this materially changes the reach and use case capacity of Box and that is a very very enticing combination for a company the size of IBM andor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>both with agendas much larger than cloud storage and collaboration to push Adding this capacity via MA at what is currently a discount to IPO pricing just makes sense With Box now having the ability to offer the entire MicrosoftBox customer base something that at least is competitive with what Dropbox is offering the MicrosoftDropbox customer base and now being paired with IBM either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or IBM stands to be inline for substantial cross selling with a purchase of Box using Box as the middle man Box should have no problem retaining both associated customer bases that it has crossover with as a result of the deep integrations with both companies Put simply the more deep integrations that Box can execute on the more attractive it becomes as a takeover It also if immediate term market reaction to both the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and the IBM announcements is an indication become a more expensive takeover target If either player is serious about taking a leadership role in the space andor leveraging a massive cross sell opportunity I anticipate rumors of a Box takeover circulating in the midterm at the latest Source Box IBM Integration Underlines My <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>And General Takeover Target Thesis Disclosure Iwe have no
