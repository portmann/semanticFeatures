some synergy Pivotal provides the tools so Ford can go forward with its tech ambitions This investment increases Fords bet on tech At a time when the company is trading for x PE is this the right move The auto industry is a competitive space and the focus seems to be shifting The focus on efficiency is fading instead executives are all looking for the next big thing As I mentioned in my article about Apple NASDAQ AAPL innovation is the key to growth for technology companies It would appear that in todays day and age auto executives believe that innovation is what will drive their companies forward At the start of the year GM invested million in Lyft a partnership which I regarded as foolish and onesided Not only did GM throw away million on an easily replicable business it was also getting almost nothing in return Why General Motors Lost Million This past Thursday Ford NYSE F announced that the company invested million in Pivotal a software company based in San Francisco Is this just money down the drain like GMs investment You probably have never heard of the company but Im sure youll be happy to hear that Pivotal isnt just some upstart that got lucky Pivotals origin can actually be traced back to the software giant EMC NYSE EMC which spun off the company back in If EMC owns it then you know that there is at least some value however speculative So what exactly does Pivotal do Pivotal is a cloudbased software company per the press release However it is not just your typical SaaS company software as a service Rather it belongs in a fairly new service category called PaaS platform as a service If we think about the developers on one end and the end product on the other end then PaaS is right in the middle ie as a tool to make software According to Pivotals history of funding the company has been very successful having also received funds from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and GE Pivotal is attractive to Ford because Ford and the broad industry is trying to marry carmaking and technology With the establishment of Ford Smart Mobility the management clearly believes that embedding new technologies into cars will make them sell From that standpoint the Pivotal investment makes sense as it would allow Ford to quickly ramp up software development by utilizing Pivotals platform Unlike GMs investment in Lyft which I believe was an overwhelmingly negative event I am currently impartial towards this move Lets look at the positive first While Pivotals business is outside of Fords comfort zone Pivotals business model does moderate Fords downside somewhat There is a saying in the business world that you should sell pickaxes during a gold rush rather than mining for gold This is analogous to how car companies today are all chasing for a miracle app to boost sales the gold and Pivotal is providing the tools to them the pickaxes Because Pivotals success is not dependent on whether its customers make a good software or not its business model is actually fairly low risk As long as there is a general positive sentiment towards tech in the market Pivotal will make money Clearly the business environment is very good today as we are seeing industrial dinosaurs trying to reinvent themselves by pouring money into tech But is this a good use of the companys cash If we continue with the gold rush analogy Ford itself is no doubt a big buyer of pickaxes as management redoubles tech efforts In a sense Ford is getting a discount on the money that it spends on Pivotal not the investment but the ongoing costs as some of the earnings will flow back to equity holders like Ford However given the companys low PE ratio x TTM one could argue that this is not a good use of cash If the management truly believes that the company is undervalued why continue to pour funds into speculative ventures like Pivotal when your own business is on sale already Note To understand how I structure the V Portfolio in whose goal is
