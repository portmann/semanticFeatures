themathematics book Statistics Topics Inthe ageof big data technology companies are positioning themselves to allow humans the ability to more easily answer previously inextricable problems with interesting techniques And while there have been some silent successes where advanced techniques have been largely embedded into organizations without fanfare there have too been a too many recent highprofile failures where companies sloppily lumber forward and collapse over their own untied shoelaces Examples are from the academically gifted teams behind Googles Flu Trends facebooks secret experiment Apples map software andMes genetics business and Kenshos Santa Claus rally call Maybe we should add Microsofts HowOldRobot onto this naughty list Their playful tool was enjoyed all over the world this month but does it truly create a better guess as to your age Here we seek to mathematically answer at what point should we reward only true precision and not what any probabilist can discern as a blooming random number generator Somewhat aware of this point their product claims to just know how old do I look instead of something more relevant which is how old am I Clearly they havent a clue about the latter and to be fair it is a near impossible task that few of us would rationally claim we can really do But we assume most people collectively look how old they actually are Else for example if all babies suddenly looked like senior citizens think Benjamin Button then people would quickly adjust their perception of what a baby looks like newborns simply would have the senior citizen age look and that appearance would then become what everyone associates back to a babys age instead so no one could really look the age of a senior citizen The idea of not knowing ones age but instead guessing at how old they looks is filled with relevant follies as we will soon see with actual output First lets see what the application looks like Consuming a mugshot of myself for science one can see the application output in the upperleft of the image below This is the best all of the advanced machine learning at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could come up with And their applications age guess is incorrect by more than a decade Or nearly a quarter of reality Its as bad as if James Franco used the tool to defend his selection of an underage girl for fooling around by stating she looked Guesses like this given any critical contexts is simply well off the mark Well return to the other three pictures above after first discussing some mathematical theory An important thing to state here isthere are ways to link the work done here by HowOldRobot to some quantitative understanding of theuncertaintybehind these guesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would have been better off providing us with the confidence interval range behind this but such a result would have been awful transparency for their marketing But still we can use probability theory to understand that at the heart of this application they are seeking only a small number of clues about the individual Despite all of the information exposed through a face the science comes down to thinking about a straight image in many cases and what might be the gender or race of the individual It would also glean from the image properties the random selection of colors and granularity provided to it and combined with facial changes over time provide an overall guess on age Such judgements would process say that a celebratedcentenarian will be more wrinkled versus a baby And for the face bone itself the modification of this over time also interacts and varies as a function of age and gender Examining the bone shape provides some information then to guess on the gender and age and in particular where exactly to partition the data between young and old across genders See these well documented science articles that have been around for details on these numbers here and here To try to understand whether the large errors on the selfportrait shown above are either good or bad we should ask the logical question of what sort ofestimate rangewould a blind monkey throwing a dart at a conditional age distribution come up with It turns out the monkey would be far closer and so this is the standard by which technology companies should appreciate that weinvariablymeasure the gravity of such a product launch We can stress now that they are charming toys today but they have the quick potential to later leap into important lifeanddeath decision engines For example they could be used to drive automated dronelaunched missile decisions or driverless vehicles or used to peruse a crowded street in search of a potential criminal Empirically this sort of probability problem concerning life age cant be theoretically solved in closed form The life tables that invariably drive this behind the scenes employ census information and are similar to actuarial tables Hence we must use logical information about the representative population of internet users and their likely cohorts which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is making the age guesses for See our article here for information on the difficulty in modeling customized actuary functions even though it is certainly possible at times and under proper guidance To appreciate the conditional life population likelihoods just seeany of these two below to get a sense of the distribution layout by gender male or female and by childrenyouth versus matureolder versus For demonstrative ease the small and censored fraction and nearly all are women of the global population aged have been categorically truncated for this exercise The topic of censoreddata treatment through statistical modeling will be dealt with in a later blog article For now we canalsosee and appreciate the dearth of recent births in the recentglobal financial crisis The complete chart with all four mutuallyexclusive and completely exhaustive population segments added to one another is shown on the lowerright Here is the distribution below forjust halfthe typical partitions based on facial bone changes hat Microsofts application would be making with the typical age and just as important the conditional standard deviation older male age older female age Clearlythe computer is doingsomethingand not blindly just guessing with each face it recognizes from the entire distribution But this is a weaker form of adding valuesimilar to how central bankers add value to their otherwise impossible ability to ever guess the critical turns in the economy and how the use of machine learning attempts to carve out basic partitions in the data There are a couple other cuts that we described earlier and beyond the evolutionary face bone changes we all experience For example the computer application can attempt to understand other major face characteristics and for a younger person they might look at amount of hair size of nose For older people they might focus more on the suppleness of eyes and skin wrinkles And as well see all of this the computer is easily prone to be deceived about Incorporating these greater number of parameters we can expect the final standard errors in Microsofts product to come in about of what is shown above Also note that this shows that for younger females the typical errors could be larger than for typical men Nonethelessa guess that is off by a decade would be greater than a typicalrandomerror eg from a monkey throwing darts ineveryselected segment Technically speaking a dartthrowing monkey or anyone would not simply guess anywhere along the entire population age distribution but rather focus on the component or zone sharing the same basic statistical characteristics of the matching face One might ask if say a trained monkey throwing a dart wouldnt just aim for the center of such a large and unwieldy distribution shape That would be incorrect interpretation of our probability analogy For those readers instead picture the entire subdistribution partitioned into or equal sized spokes And now each one of those is used to complete the dartboard design of same number of spokes The monkey would then blindly aim for the dartboard the board could be spun along its center if thats a concern Of course we know the subdistributions of the population eg each colored segment above is unequalweighted to begin with This is just to be analytically complete in describing the random process the computer goes through The computer does not simply randomly guess and model off of the entire distribution This is similar to say FICO credit scores where the computer seeks first to isolate the user into legally it must be very rudimentary demographic buckets first and then more finely guess the parametric characteristics for each group In the end we hope the entire model works but the proof is only seen in the output and without <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>providing an actual confidence interval we on our own here collect and demonstrate their flawed outofsample results The errors caused by this tool in failing to have an unbiased guess as to ones age shows faults right away as we seen it applied above to a single person For appropriate people this can also be shown by looking at his or her own pictures from decades ago and noticinghow Microsofts guessed age appears sticky As if pivoting about one of the final segment ages above eg see the sampled ones above For even the three other selfportraits further above we can see how just small contortions to the picture altering the face shape provide a quick age bias and even further in the wrong direction This of course is not an issue only for the author but across theentirehuman population where even a correct answer could have been a false negative eg a lucky guess Lets look at other important contortions on different types of people Well look at Hollywood actresses a group that is selection biased towards a segment whose very career survival depends on being young Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>if anything would always err on the side of looking younger when guessing at this cohorts But there too it instead spectacularly at times nor can it account for pervasive plastic surgery and other artificial deformities But look at this Andy Warhol impression of one of his most illustrious muses Marilyn Monroe What would be your age guess on this First HowOldRobot doesnt even recognize a face in the upper left But then working clockwise it concludes these ages for the other equal portraits Ouch Now all the guesses are horrible wrong in the same direction and the worst offender was a guess at twice the age at which shedied We noticed earlier that the conditional gender probability is not equal Notice the two upper distributions in the foursome further above Notice thebluecolored male distribution and how for a main segment it must often compete in the middle age categories with the larger female populations inredandpink This only means that on the margins the advanced robot can confuse a middleage man with a female Despite the current cultural focus on makeup and beauty we can see from the information supplied above that female faces agesfasterover their lengthier lifespans And the falsepositives exist in both directions Lets return now to the popular news above concerning the wrongdoings of James Franco How did Microsofts ageguessing application even work onhim Actually do you meanher Thats right blame it all on a sloppy trumpeting of machine learning but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>pegs James Franco at years older than reality which is relatively a lot and also has James guessed to be one hirsutewoman This should not fit nicely into their disclaimer about not getting the age and genderquiteright To see what the mathematics is of what should be going on see thisblueimage below from a scientific capture done on the authors face Notice that the statistical characteristics assumed to go into a complicated highresolution face shown in our selfportrait at the top of this article really only boil down to a small number of independent factors we literally summarize below To briefly detour this is similar to a popular idea to what was created by a thcentury Harvard statistician selfnamed Chernoffs faces Unlike changing dotmarkers or line types the complex face can capture and communicate cues that serve as feature variables A human might see Chernoff faces in any physicians office where only a single dimension is used to express happy through sad By simply altering the value of the mouth and eyes along the illustration and the patient pointing to the facial expression they most relate to We can see below that an adjustment canalsobe made in a small number of other ways say to the length and width of the face as another measure to communicate Note that touting the transformation of a highresolution color imagery that exists today is overboard when the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ageguessing errors are this bad Returning now to the above scientific computer capture of the author inblue The properties here could have the potential of a binary indicator value at each point along the image reducing all of the easy to understand face information to quick security print in the magnitude ofcombinations Unfortunately this is still too much information and too costly to store and retrieve So instead the science migrates to a lower magnitude of roughly One of the weaknesses of the machine learning approach is that it assumes that every data set has the capability to be addressed meaningfully through its process Sometimes the products are still far off from being an important tool one that the underlying science and math hasnt been well recognized for and wont be unless further technological and mathematical advancements can be made Imagine the whimsical and brute force nature of mixing together PlayDoh which comes with the individual colors segregated into different containers Anyone can mathematically present a color model at he time of purchase where each container equals separates and explains a single color Put a few colors sidebyside and a traditional linear model makes sense still similar to a magician using parallel and linear blades to saw through a volunteer in a box Now we will think about things more complicated representative of real world data Say the elegance of the Chinese philosophical symbol known as yin and yang in modern culture Advanced mathematicians can still come up with a more sophisticated mathematical expression to bisect the two opposing colors there But now imagine a more complicated and somewhat spurious kneading of the different PlayDoh colors One can then have a final assembly of a product that is merely too complicated to model the colors from the amalgamation even as the compact exterior mold looks seductively benign It took modern artist Jeff Koons years to put this together Twenty years is greater than the standard error of some of the subdistribution life estimates above What linear traditional mathematical model could pierce through such a stunning multidimensional PlayDoh expression As an advanced probabilist it is easy to conclude there is none And it is improbable that we can use sophisticated machine learning and big data to finely explain the location of each of the like colors as if they were from a simplenonporous unit These are life limitations that scientists and business people can run into trouble if they chase too hard against a bad problem Big data algorithms dont care about mathematical precision so much They are too quick to estimate random art and too glacial to express the expense and errors in the value they presume to create by following their procedures They would have you believe that every museum exhibit concerning something similar with PlayDoh would look similar That there is a mathematical logic and meaning to almost everything Put differently their interpretation of the artistic and multidimensional model above is that every color is in a certain place for a reason similar to the fundamentalex antelogic we had for the colors in the population distribution manufactured earlier in this article But this is a runaway fantasy that doesnt work Even as Microsofts model aims and successfully does to a partial though insufficient degree to reduce the variability in age guessing from a universal set of the population we showed here that the conditional volatility allows for heterogeneous errors in large predefined segments of the population at any point in time This makes to any reasonable quantitative person the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>product oddly fail versus how it is advertised It also completely fails in different ways as could have been generally been predicted and presents a definite permanent setback and visible weakness of machinelearning algorithms in their instability to be rolledout broadly The product failed unaccountably by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>anyway with this author And with Andy Warhol and Marilyn Monroe And with James Franco Social media is populated with other cases of breakdown In the final analysis it will always be wiser counsel for companies esteemed as Google and Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to operate and promote within their confines of whats possible given the technical and resource gaps that exist Gaffes are not only avoidable but for largestakes risks we need to secure the publics trust They should have known this product is merely a pleasure tool and broadly acknowledge the incapability of its precision to happen in at least this innovation cycle Instead they expose the gimmick of how sensitive these seemingly advanced products are to wild errors and leave a sensible public perplexed We noticed as well both here and generally in life that faces are extraordinarily beautiful and complex As an artist they are highly difficult to even draw and explain Clearly probability and statistics have a place in cracking the riddle behind how they work One day we might wrest control to a robot of quick and lifethreatening decisions anywhere in the world These errors will no longer be a source of pleasure but rather imply real lives were sacrificed Right now you wouldnt wanta monkey as a TSA agent on guard to check airline passengers ID and highlight suspicion We could all appreciate the nuisance and aggravation caused byerrors Statistical falsepositives people routinely being inconvenienced and falsenegatives threats that always go undetected are both frequent costly and will lead to hazardous vulnerabilities Unfortunately we operate in a commercial world where Watson and Deep Blue are forcedonly through brute forcenot through something advanced and clever to stay ahead of humans but then are advertised as proof that technology companies today can easily solve everything important Such as strangely state something that no human alive would falsely concluding with all of Microsofts advanced horsepower that James Franco is actually an older woman Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant off topic discussions it would be appreciated Lastly kindly forgo all civility in your discourse you are after all anonymous Ritholtz has been observing
