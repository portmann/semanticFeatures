class='textDiv'>Yahoo Mail Takes A Page Out Of The Apple Playbook Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoo is out with a major upgrade to its Mail app Yahoo has essentially ripped off Apples platforminterface but also included a few convenience updates of its own that are meaningful I believe this app update is going to be quite positive on midlongterm key metrics as this should do well for user retention and engagement Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO has finally done what has been done by all of its competitors for years it has borrowed an idea that has had great success in another companys model and replicated it This particular idea is that of completely ripping off Apples NASDAQ AAPL email platformuser interface and calling it its own By the way well done Yahoo Well done Also its about time Ill explain First the big news of the day is that Yahoo has updated its email app This is more meaningful than many will realize This update is comprehensive and has brought Yahoos email platform out of the waste bin and back into relevancy In my opinion Yahoo Mail prior to today was the single most unusable email platform available within reason I dont consider Hotmail etc to be relevant to the comparisons Prior to today and Ive just spent a good while giving the app update a run through the app and mail service was slow glitchy ugly thats a personal opinion had nearzero functionality as a result of the prior noted and was borderline confusing with ad placement appearing in the inbox line items as if they were emails Of course that was done on purpose but made it no less frustrating I cant even imagine how frustrating it was Ive heard this frustration voiced from older relatives to Yahoos olderless tech savvy population Thursdays update changed essentially all of that That matters for Yahoo and YHOO longs It also matters to proud emailapp snobs like myself This move is incredibly long overdue but does in fact make Yahoo Mail usable again for those still using Yahoo Mail which might be a bigger silent majority than many realize Bash on Yahoo Mail as I might I myself have a personal account that I still use sparingly from my days as a teenager Thats right the guy who has endless complaints about the platform and who openly calls it a pariah prior to today still saw the ads and still was a frequent monetization target for the company The fact that I might start checkingusing the platform more often is meaningful My guess is quite a bit of Yahoos closetuser population at least turns a head at the updates today Who knows Yahoo might see some closetusers come back thats a bit ambitious to state with confidence this early into the update but it might That matters as well So before addressing why this update matters to Yahoo outside of closetuser engagement upticking a bit lets breakout exactly what Yahoo updated For starters it updated everything Yahoos updated UI might look familiar And it should its a replica of Apples on device UI as mentioned in the intro I again really like this move by Yahoo Instead of trying to launch its own aesthetics and functional flow Yahoo stuck with a look and feel that users are already highly familiar with Heck many are most likely using the Yahoo Mail app on an Apple device This was smart in that this at least on the front end removes as much friction from switchingadding into usage as possible Thats a great start Yahoo continued its momentum by improving on the ways users can engage the platform specifically with attachments With old Yahoo Mail both desktop and mobile this was a nightmare function to perform Outside of the fact that old Yahoo Mail was slow and glitchy and hideous while were at it the attachment flow was a several step process that often resulted in error Now the updated app acts identically to the way you already perform this function via Apples mail app Simple effective fast Thatll work Yahoo also fixed what was one of the more noticeable gaping holes of its platform and my guess is primarily used functions of its mail platform in updating and improving its search function Again I only use my Yahoo account for communicating with family but often only to receive family emails while I reply from my default nonYahoo platform via Apples Mail app ondevice and as a glorified storage bin to hold memories from years past That means outside of acting as a oneway email intake system the Yahoo Mail app on my phone is only otherwise used as a memory container You can imagine being able to effectively search through these memories is important Again my guess is that this is a similar use case to many in my age group and the age group of Yahoos much older users Updating this is meaningful Finally Yahoo built into its update some serious convenience The two marquee features Account Key and Me Mail are unique to Yahoos platform that means differentiation for the time being Differentiation in the email world is an unheard of unseen unicorn that some believe doesnt exist Yahoo found the existence of this with new features Account Key is basically single sign on via proximity Once logged into your updated app via your primary read mobile device the loggingin on secondary devices can be done by requesting permission from the primary device A push request is sent to the primary device which is granted or denied granting or denying the secondary access point without the use of a password Me Mail is Yahoos realization and admission that its email app is fighting its way to respect and usage from the cellars Me Mail is the prebuilt capability to send yourself an email read Yahoos admission that some use it strictly for storage andor organization from the Compose button presumably used in everybody elses app for composing outgoing mail Still Yahoos sense of awareness and willingness to leverage its apparent use cases into what could become expanded use cases is impressive and speaks well to the bigger picture narrative being built by the Mail team from the ground floor up I can respect that So what does all this mean to Yahoo Why did I just break out how an email app was updated Several reasons Again the primary reason is this might bring more users to the Yahoo ecosystem Some might be closet users like myself and some might be new users That will matter to the key metrics if realized This update also likely retains a big portion of the existing email user base especially olderless tech savvy users who might have been growing frustrated or already were frustrated with the old borderline unusable platform The new updates really are substantial That too will matter to key metrics Yahoo also now stands to be able to gather data via success of both of the above and because now it offers a way to aggregate email platforms Thats an entirely new capacity for Yahoo and one that is monetizable Finally one of the big reasons this update matters is it shows at least to me it does maybe a change in philosophy at Yahoo of one of optimization regardless of how the optimization is come by This was a philosophy adopted by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT when CEO Satya Nadella took control of the company and it has paid huge dividends If Yahoo decides to optimize itself at least onpar with best of breed solutions thats going to position it differently than it is now And from a user aggregation standpoint thats meaningful While this update might go unnoticed by a large population of tech enthusiasts and some Yahoo followers no doubt it shouldnt This is meaningful in reality and its meaningful in symbolism Id like to see more of this from Yahoo and I think we will We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
