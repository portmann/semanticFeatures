strategy in mediatech its only a matter of time before Siriuss advantage in original content and the auto becomes a musthave Its a new era in the media industry The line between what we know as a media company and tech company have begun to overlap The conversation is now at the point where analysts cant tell the difference And all of this bodes well for Satellite radio provider Sirius XM NASDAQ SIRI which reports firstquarter earnings results Tuesday before the opening bell For years Siriuss perceived value has been tied to the perception that it is a slowmoving media dinosaur Accordingly its PE of is often compared to the likes of Time Warner NYSE TWX PE of or DirecTV NASDAQ DTV PE of That is to say SIRI stock is too expensive But this is no longer or even Mel Karmazins era of running Sirius into the ground with nearsighted solutions is over Sirius by its success and thriving business model is now a likely takeout candidate for Apple NASDAQ AAPL which is looking to gain ground not only in the automobile but also in original content Dare I say Sirius can make Beats sound better in the car Sure the word radio an antiquated media term remains on the companys letterhead Sirius by the changing of the markets perception about media is being measured more closely today to the new age of mediatech than the old And for SIRI stock this is going to have an appreciable effect in the quarters ahead per share for SIRI stock is a matter of when not if Netflix NASDAQ NFLX is just as much of a technology company as it is media Disagree Take it up with its CEO whos made this statement on more than one occasion Original content however is what has made Netflix the king of streaming House of Cards Orange is the New Black and now Daredevil prove that the old cliche cash is king is meaningless Instead content is the new king And good luck defining what category Amazon NASDAQ AMZN belongs in is it retail tech or media Heres a hint Amazon also streams movies and has awardwinning original content Ever heard of Transparent Apple meanwhile has long been associated with music and movies just as much as it is known for software and hardware devices And in the fall television is expected to be part of Apples platform But Apples television ambitions are not likely to impress unless Apple dabbles in some form of original content Thats what Netflixs results suggest and its why Amazon is going to Hollywood looking for ways to grow its library of original content For Sirius XM this all proves why its model of original programming is now invaluable No longer does it matter whether Sirius is better than Pandora NYSE P or Spotify or fill in the blank Siriuss original content will continue to give it an edge over competitors that merely broadcastplay whats already available on any other platform Plus that Sirius by its connected car capabilities with Agero continues to push further into the tech realm gives it an additional edge where neither Pandora or Spotify can compete The car is the next new frontier according to Apple But the car is not new for Sirius which already has more than million subscribers Not to mention its selfpay subscribers are signing up at more than each quarter Apple cant ignore this Why Because Siriuss original content has had a lot to do with its growth This means if the auto is indeed a new frontier for Apple its tough to see how Sirius then is not a takeout target if not for Apple certainly by one of Apples competitors like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT thats looking to play defense In short Sirius has taken everyones best shot and lives to tell about it With MA having become the new strategy in mediatech its only a matter of time before Sirius advantage in original content and in the auto becomes a musthave for any company looking to gain an edge in this new era of media Source Sirius XM Why Apple Still
