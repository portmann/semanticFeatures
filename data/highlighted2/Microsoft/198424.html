Seeking Alpha Jae Jun Old School Value Stock Analysis Software clicks Why Microsofts strategic shift to combine software and hardware is working My intrinsic value range for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I only have an old iPad that I got from eBay NASDAQ EBAY but Apple NASDAQ AAPL is my second biggest holding and I outline why Apple is an obvious buy of my laptops have been Windows and I dont own any shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT yet Now that Im a firm believer in Microsofts shift into the hardware space Im having a big case of shoulda woulda coulda for not having bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the to low range First my biggest error was assuming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be stuck where it was forever If you just look at the stock chart its easy to think that because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was stuck at for a decade Second was dismissing Surface Pro and their entry into the hardware space as a shortterm test Its done nothing for years Ive got plenty of time Ill look into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>when there is nothing else to invest in I told myself Keep in mind that I have no interest in making this into a tech gizmo article about specs performance future products and comparisons of the new Surface product line with the Macbook What is happening and is becoming more obvious with each Surface model is that Microsofts entrance into the hardware industry is revitalizing the PC space Apple has shown how successful the business model is Outside of the phone and computing industry its common sense to provide your own software and hardware The Bloomberg Terminal provides HW and SW for a massive amount of money and is entrenched in the financial industry Square provides fantastic looking and functioning credit card swiping hardware with quality software Fitbit has a gorgeous user interface that functions seamlessly with the HW GoPro will be stupid to distribute Adobe Premier Pro as their video editor So it doesnt make sense to claim that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is copying Apple To put it politely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>woke up from a year beauty sleep Just a few years back it was unthinkable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be competing with their hardware partners like Dell and HP NYSE HPQ But you cant hide the cold hard facts that PC shipments dropped last quarter and have declined for quarters straight But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>did what no other PC manufacturer was able to do They created a product that broke boundaries and illustrated the capabilities of their software This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will succeed and why Im a firm believer in them now Until recently pureplay hardware companies could only take their products and innovation to what the fastest chip was how light and thin they could make the product Their thinking and innovation was constrained to hardware specs instead of seeing beyond and breaking through convention The Surface Pro and Surface Book is a glimpse of Microsofts newfound sexiness and control over the entire product development <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is already a dynamite free cash flow machine thanks to Office Windows and Enterprise business The Office subscription model is growing and now add hardware revenue growth that is sprinting forward Three years ago the Surface business generated a whopping zero Today its up to billion in sales click to enlarge Source old school value At the moment no company comes close to Apple in terms of FCF and the amount of money they hold but this is a whole new revenue and FCF stream for Windows that is growing quickly When you put the billion in sales into context it makes up less than of total revenues today but my sneaking suspicion is that it wont be so negligible in years time and it will be another huge push to the bottom line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Is Expensive With High Expectations Compared To Apple I would never have imagined saying this but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is more expensive with higher expectations than Apple Apples only receiving a multiple of x EVEBIT Its highest multiple in the past years was x in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ended with an EVEBIT of x The highest it has ever been in over years higher than Apple and above the industry average PFCF is at x which is outside of my desired x range Goes to show how quickly market sentiment can change for a stock To prove this one of the best ways is to perform a reverse DCF A reverse DCF will show you what type of growth is expected from the current stock price It makes it easier to understand whether a stock is over or undervalued Looks like the market is pricing in a growth rate of around for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office is a moat Windows is a moat Enterprise ecosystem is a moat In the reverse DCF I used the GAAP net income number as thats what the market uses to price stocks Combine all these different angles of looking at valuation and the fair value range I get here is to Waiting For A Bigger Margin Of Safety In terms of margin of safety a fair vale of isnt out of the question but it also requires a lot of things to in Microsofts favor Valuation is both art and science and from the experience of having valued hundreds of stocks my senses tell me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is more in the mid range It also makes sense from a probability stand point too Predicting the time to hit is out of my control and valuation is a moving target Even if I took as my target it only offer a margin of safety to the current price My fair values could drop or it could increase but my investment philosophy is to be disciplined and not chase I miss out on a lot of investments and by waiting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to fall lower to be within my margin of safety buying range I could be missing out on a great opportunity But at the same time having the willpower to say no and sticking with basic principles has saved my bacon plenty of times We
