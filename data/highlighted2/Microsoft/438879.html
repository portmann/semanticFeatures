class='textDiv'>Margins The Crack In Microsofts Armor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Everyone is talking about Microsofts proposed purchase of LinkedIn Microsofts track record of acquisitions isnt good but this is the first large purchase under Nadella Declining margins over the past decade are deteriorating shareholder wealth Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT recent proposal to purchase LinkedIn NYSE LNKD as well as its spotty acquisition record has been covered on Seeking Alpha and other news sources quite a bit already One thing that isnt discussed as much is the companys deteriorating returns on invested capital and return on equity Ive been a longtime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bull its one of the first companies I ever bought but its getting to the point where Im questioning my logic for holding shares Most of Microsofts shoddy acquisition track record can be attributed to previous CEO Steve Ballmer Now that Satya Nadella runs the show at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>maybe we should see how his first bigtime acquisition plays out before passing judgment right Thats hard for me to do but maybe Im wrong I was personally hoping for higher margins better cash flow and better shareholder returns going forward not the purchase of a profitless social media company Heres the first crack in Microsofts armor from my point of view MSFT Profit Margin Annual data by YCharts While many other blue chips are maintaining recordhigh margins to the point where Im beginning to question their sustainability Microsofts margins seem to be more and more suppressed especially recently The company seems to take a lot of onetime charges related to lousy acquisitions as well to the point where Im starting to think that theyre basically a normal occurrence Hopefully LinkedIn will be different Microsofts return on invested capital continues to descend downward and Id argue that its mostly because of weak margins This indicates at least to me that its become better at squandering my shareholder wealth than it has at just distributing it out in the form of dividends Give me the cash please Created by Joseph Harry data from Morningstar Moving on to the equity perspective we can see margins have been a real drag on ROE too I created the below Dupont to specifically highlight whats driving the downward pressure Created by Joseph Harry data from Morningstar Deteriorating operating margins coupled with weakening utilization of assets helps explain the weakening ROE trend and this is despite higher leverage over the last three years Margins matter especially if you base managements performance on capital allocation and not just nonGAAP earnings and revenue growth While Microsofts financials are often muddied up by onetime charges looking at margins at the gross level still reveals a telling sign of longterm margin compression over the last decade MSFT Gross Profit Margin NYSE TTM data by YCharts Microsofts margins just aint what they used to be which isnt a good sign for longterm return on equity or invested capital I dont know how LinkedIn will help this situation either Now for the bright spots free cash flow and earnings quality Created by Joseph Harry data from Morningstar This trend has taken a slight dip recently but Im not as worried about it because theres still an impressive amount of cash being thrown off from the companys existing businesses If Microsofts free cash continues to decline rapidly Ill be watching a little closer however I like that legacy products such as Office are being integrated into the cloud and converted into recurring revenue streams going forward I think this will make cash flows more sticky If LinkedIn somehow factors into all of this and improves it even better Created by Joseph Harry data from Morningstar When EBIT covers net income thats good When free cash flow covers net income its great Id argue that for all of its acquisitive blunders and managementrelated flaws it still retains its cash cow status This gives the firm plenty of wiggle room to figure out how to right its margin ship Its also probably good news for dividends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is obviously in the middle of a transitional period moving more into its cloudrelated business and integrating legacy products along the way Its fairly friendly to shareholders in regard to dividends too I think its a decent income stock at the right price but Im not really a buyer here until I see some stability in margins It looks like theyre in a freefall as of now The good thing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is its continued ability to generate a very large amount of cash flow from very little capital investment The problem of falling free cash flow remains however The LinkedIn acquisition irked me but Im willing to give Nadella a mulligan on this one Maybe theres something to the deal that will grow shareholder wealth that Im missing but the purchase price says otherwise Id like it more if the company would stop with the acquisitions that cripple earnings and cut into margins All it seems to do is drag down ROE and muck up the firms financial statements As of now Im still holding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares because I still think its a premium franchise with a widemoat but Im also exploring the thought of trimming my position a little here I view the declining tech giant as more of an income stock that I can take dividends from to invest elsewhere but also with the possibility of a successful turnaround that will fuel the capital appreciation fire further down the road I think at least some of the market views <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a growthcloud play now which is fine but I think thats more of a story than something to base an investment thesis on Its just not backed up by the fundamentals yet If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future please feel free to hit the
