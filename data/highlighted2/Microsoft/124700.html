Alpha SNE has an insurmountable advantage after June NPD figures show PS outsells XBox One again MSFT did have strong sales growth compared to last year and Xbox One is selling better than the Xbox so it isnt all bad Next focus should be less about topping the charts more about creating a new PCconsole hybrid ecosystem looking to VR AR battles ahead With more resources coming in for Xbox MSFT is making additional investments in new technologies hoping to get the next battle off to a better start than this one The console war is over and Sony NYSE SNE has come out the runaway winner over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT According to the June NPD numbers the PS beat the Xbox One for the fifth time in six months despite <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gaining a temporary sales boost during E week where new consoles were sold at a discount Nevertheless with a near million console advantage the gap is too large to make up for this generation With games like Activisions NASDAQ ATVI Call of Duty moving to a PS first model along with other multiplatform developers like Batman Arkham Knight its clear which company the industry and consumer base favors But maybe its not all bad for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>With Windows set to launch July that will enable Xbox One streaming on PCs and with a wellregarded E showcase featuring HoloLens and Oculus Rift technology perhaps the Xbox One doesnt need to win the console war to be successful In fact with a little help from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the form of technological integration and strategic investment it might stage a comeback in when virtual and augmented reality will get its due The headlines for the June NPD numbers were bad for the company more PSs were sold and the top selling game of the month was best sold as a PS bundle rather than as an Xbox One standalone However once one digs a little deeper into the numbers there are figures that should encourage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors and loyalists Xbox One saw a increase in sales compared to June and Xbox Live accounts increased by over the same timeframe This is likely due to the E week sale that did sell more consoles over those seven days compared to PS but also because major upcoming titles will not be Xbox compatible The problem with this strategy though is that the only time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can generate any sales momentum is when it knocks down the price Sure the Xbox One came under criticism early on for being nearly more expensive than a PS which was one of the many faults people had with the console but consistently relying on sales for strippeddown versions which mostly were about getting rid of the unpopular Kinect and TV integrations anyway leaves a dent in Microsofts wallet in terms of lost sales and millions in RD for additions that few actually wanted This might change with the arrival of HoloLens and Oculus Rift the latter being primarily financed by Oculus parent company Facebook but for the present its an example of why Sony has been able to put the console war to bed In terms of games Minecraft came in at in physical sales according to the NPD figures with Xbox and Xbox One the lead consoles in each generation This is especially important because it was Minecraft that served as the companys test game for the new HoloLens at E and at Minecon With a game that remains popular to consumers as well as a strong PC following that largely preceded console adaptations it gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a strong platform to test out its new augmented reality technology as well as how PC and console gaming can exist in the same universe with very little risk to the company brand Minecraft is a perennially popular title for gamers which means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has something to play around with headed into According to NPD bundle sales in June made up over of hardware sales up from the year prior With widely expected titles such as Halo and EAs NASDAQ EA Star Wars Battlefront set to become Xbox One exclusives and firstlaunch respectively the latter part of EAs subscription service EAAccess <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will likely be offering bundle packages around the holiday season to gin up sales In light of how Xbox has become dependent on discounts and packages to move product and how its not getting them closer to recapturing the high ground in the console wars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will hopefully look to adjust its sales strategy focusing more on game quality and selling the Xbox One to Xbox hangerson rather than trying to win over the few neutral observers left If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can sell the Xbox One as a gamerfriendly console rather than the unfocused entertainment omnibus it was originally it could win over future developers to make exclusive and premiere content for them instead of the PS especially since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is increasing its investment in independent developers Also with increasing PC integration upon release of Windows it will mean the Xbox will become an area of increased importance for the company as the fate of its gaming division will become intertwined with its core PC business This will become especially important as the attention of the gaming world shifts to virtual reality in and the coming battle between Oculus Rift and Sonys Project Morpheus with HoloLens standing alone in the augmented reality business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>lost the th generation console war due to selfinflicted injuries With more resources plowing into virtual and augmented reality the next battle is not a fight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can afford to lose Source Is It Good That <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft
