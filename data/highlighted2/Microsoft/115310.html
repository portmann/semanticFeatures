Mac growth as in iPhone has been fueled by China Although Mac sales have been outgrowing the PC market Apples global market share of indicates that there is more opportunity for growth Gartner and IDC recently released PC sales estimates for the June quarter with widely varying Mac sales estimates Gartner estimated a sales decline for Mac in the US while IDC estimates sales gains both in the US and globally The difference may be partly explainable by the impact of Apples NASDAQ AAPL booming China business Apples strong iPhone sales in China had a halo effect on Mac sales in the March quarter Apple can expect more of the same for June Its hard to tell from the results of Gartner and IDC whether the divergence between their results is systematic or merely random noise Gartner concluded that Apples Mac sales had declined by yy to million units in the US for calendar Q Meanwhile Gartner doesnt even show Apple making the top five globally IDC shows a gain of to million units in the US while placing Apple fourth globally with million units To add to the confusion while Gartners estimates are sell in wholesale to distribution channels IDC states that its estimates can be either sell in or sell through retail to end users Apples quarterly sales data are in fact a combination of both since Apple sells both to distributors and directly through its retail stores and online This alone could account for the difference between Gartner and IDC with respect to Apple Gartner and IDC at least more or less agree on the state of Windows PC sales as both show significant yy PC sales declines according to Gartner according to IDC And both arrive at the same explanation for the decline presumed inventory reductions ahead of the launch of Windows Despite the free upgrade to Win this probably is a compelling motive for Windows PC makers and says much about the stigma of Windows None of the manufacturers want to have their machines on display with Win once Win is released Given that IDC includes retail and wholesale sales in their calculations I consider it very likely that IDCs number will be much closer to what Apple will report for the June quarter Mac sales of million for the quarter represent yy unit shipment growth according to IDC I estimate Mac sales revenue to be about billion for the quarter for yy growth As I recently discussed in Apple Clobbers Samsung In China the key to understanding how Apple is bucking the overall PC market trend is Apples performance in China During Apples March quarter earnings call CEO Tim Cook mentioned that Mac unit sales were up in China Clearly strong iPhone sales are having a halo effect Combined with Apples ever increasing retail presence and the effort to make OS X and iOS easier for Chinese language users I expect Mac unit sales to be strong once again in the quarter Mac has become the aspirational personal computer brand in China just as iPhone has become the aspirational smart phone brand Apples leadership has been very proud of the way Mac sales have grown even as the overall PC market has declined Despite this we may look back at what has happened over the past couple of years as a missed opportunity for Apple This is driven by two fundamental observations The first is that much of the slow down of Windows PC sales may be attributed to the impact of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Windows During the last two years that Windows PC sales have been hobbled by the impact of Win Apple had a golden opportunity to greatly expand its market share With the advent of Win the opportunity that Win represented for Apple probably comes to an end Windows will probably satisfy most Windows users that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is back on track and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will achieve its goal of having billion Windows users within two years as I discussed in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Mobilizes The PC The second observation is that Apples US market share hasnt really changed all that much since the advent of Win At the time that Win was released in Q Apple had an share of the US personal computer market according to IDC As of IDCs latest report Apple now has a share of the US market a gain of percentage points Not much to show for what Apple claims to be the worlds most advanced operating system Not long after investors started to realize that Apple has benefited mightily from expansion in China concerns emerged about Apples exposure to economic issues in China such as the recent stock market declines Fellow SA contributor Stone Fox Capital has a good discussion of this Obviously Apple cant control macroeconomic factors and a recession in China would undoubtedly not be good for sales However its not clear that whats going on in the China markets is necessarily a harbinger of recession Also as an aspirational brand that is still out of reach for the majority of Chinese consumers Apple may be protected to some degree from an economic downturn in China The wealthy tend to stay wealthy despite macroeconomic circumstances Just as the recession in the US represented an opportunity to buy Apple shares on the cheap I concur with Stone Fox that a downturn in China might also present buying opportunities for Apple Despite not having fully capitalized on the Win debacle I continue to view personal computers as a large untapped area for growth for Apple as I discussed in What Is The Future Of The Mac With a global market share of only according to IDC there is arguably more potential for growth in Mac at least in market share than there is in iPhone The key of course is greater price competitiveness something that Apple has been slowly creeping up on But theres only so much Apple can do with pricing as long as Macs depend on Intel NASDAQ INTC processors Intels pricing of their Core series processors reflects their nearmonopoly on high performance x processors for desktop and laptop applications In the Future of the Mac and other articles Ive focused on reducing processor cost as a way to achieve greater price competitiveness of the Mac without sacrificing build quality the aluminum unibody is a must or gross margin Ive suggested that a Mac based on Apples ARM architecture SOCs could achieve the necessary cost savings There are of course consequences to switching to ARM for the Mac So heres another thought AMD NASDAQ AMD Apple already uses AMDs graphics chips AMDs Accelerated Processing Units APUs are essentially low end desktoplaptop class systems on chip SOCs that contain highly capable AMD graphics built in Although AMDs APUs served as the basis for the semicustom chips AMD supplies for XBox One and Playstation they havent done particularly well in the general PC market This is due in large part to being fabricated on a nm node Kaveri and the new Carrizo series which is hardly competitive with Intels latest nm node The second factor hurting APU sales is that AMDs designs have lagged Intel in terms of performance even after taking process into account AMD has some interesting products in the pipeline for as described by Mark Papermaster AMD SVP and Chief Technology Officer in his Financial Analyst Day presentation Mark Papermaster the reader may recall served briefly at Apple as head of Hardware Engineering Papermaster describes two key technology thrusts for AMD in The first is a move to an all new CPU architecture dubbed Zen which promises design improvements as well as fabrication on probably Global Foundries forthcoming nm FinFET process node The second major thrust is moving AMDs graphics chips to FinFET as well So AMDs key product lines in CPUs and GPUs will both benefit from nm FinFET Its not clear that Zen will achieve performance parity with Intel but it may represent a better priceperformance value AMD is very hungry and has been willing to live with much lower margins than Intel AMD may hand Apple a golden opportunity to win even more PC market share Source Apple Mac Sales Growth Driven By China In The June Quarter Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL
