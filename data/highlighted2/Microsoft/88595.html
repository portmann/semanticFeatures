class='textDiv'>Microsofts Great Leap Forward In Gaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha At E MSFT blows away audiences with new releases and new technology Gaming will now integrate Xbox One and Windows along with virtual and augmented reality devices MSFT enters holiday season with new Halo Tomb Raider and Fable games as well as backwards compatibility and system upgrades Long thought of as a side project MSFT is out to show investors that gaming is now a significant aspect of its business and should be treated as such If the preMonday events at E were any indicator this years edition of the convention was going to be of greater significance to gamers than last years edition In fact given the hardware rollouts it might be closer to when the current generation of consoles was first debuted to an eager gaming public Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT press conference was first on the days docket in Los Angeles just a few days after announcing their partnership with Facebooks Oculus Rift for virtual reality gaming NASDAQ FB so it was unclear what else they would reveal As it turned out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had a lot more in the tank from completing its atonement for the infamous backwards compatibility snafu to an impressive lineup of exclusive content such as new Tomb Raider and Halo titles as well as further independent gaming development Viewers could tell which games were the most important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to show off judging by which ones premiered with actual gameplay rather than prerendered cinema trailers which included Halo Guardians the newest entrant in the massively popular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>franchise After over a decade of Halo being the crown jewel in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gaming empire one can be forgiven if the th chapter didnt sound as mouthwatering as previous incarnations especially given the numerous offshoots each generation of the game has come out with such as ODST and the realtime strategy game Halo Wars After peaking at nearly million copies of Halo sold upon its release subsequent editions havent hit that point with Halo selling only million copies though the million in gross sales in the first hours did set a new singleday record Also Studios the caretakers of this franchise have a lot of trust to earn back from the loyal gaming public due to the glitch plagued rollout of The Master Chief Collection back in November Meant to be a package of every Halo game within the Master Chiefs story arc remastered for the Xbox One it became more known for multiplayer functionality that crashed upon release with resulting patches making the collection almost unplayable For such an iconic series and for a game that was marketed in Xbox bundles on the heels of Ubisofts bugprone Assassins Creed Unity it was a heartbreaking disappointment So how does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>try to right the ship By throwing a new twist into the Master Chief storyarc through gameplay that has the player in the role of Sargent Locke who has usually been a nonplayer character NPC in the story trying to find the AWOL Master Chief Why he has gone AWOL has not been revealed and gamers responded well to the new wrinkle In addition to the new story there is also a new multiplayer experience called Warzone which appears to mix player vs player combat with NPC enemies like The Covenant to create a frantic freeforall fighting experience Add in the fact that this will be the first member of the franchise made specifically for Xbox One and there should be enough reasons for the gaming community to flock to this game on its October release even if it might not be the recordbreaker other editions have been in the past A major theme of Microsofts hardware announcements is that it is trying to become like Sony NYSE SNE in terms of appealing to hardcore gamers while at the same time stitching PC and console gaming together as one universe as well as fixing old sins In terms of repenting for old sins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced that backwards compatibility for Xbox games will be made available for free starting this holiday season and Xbox games will still have access to Xbox One features such as storing gameplay videos and multiplayer ability This is a welcome turn of events after this was initially deemed impossible and allowed Sony to use it as a bludgeon in the console wars for the past two years and integrating Xbox One functions is a nice cherry on top Granted this is the kind of development that should have happened when the console first came out but credit where credit is due Looking to the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced numerous games that will be both Xbox One and Windows exclusives such as Fable Legends complemented by the ability to play console gaming opponents from ones PC and having single player achievements transferred to the console Not only does this break down the barrier between two inhouse products but it also shows that Microsofts plan for the new Windows OS is to build a whole ecosystem around it with gaming as its focus touched on already by the Oculus announcement Furthermore it means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is moving gaming into a core part of its business rather than a side project which means that investors may have to start looking at the gaming division with as much scrutiny as the companys more traditional aspects This is especially true if HoloLens Microsofts augmented reality device that enables users to project games on any flat surface and whose Minecraft demonstration amazed and baffled viewers winds up being the future of technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>followed up its preE Oculus partnership with a deeply informative press conference that mixed advanced technology with interesting new editions of popular titles that sets the company up very well for a good next months From an investment perspective the integration of Xbox Windows and the new virtual and augmented reality devices will be key in driving people to upgrade their consoles and PC operating systems In fact the conference ended with Phil Spencer head of Xbox imploring those in attendance to upgrade if they havent already signifying the hopes for the company to get the ecosystem up and running as soon as they can to dominate the supposed new frontier of gaming In terms of titles one cant go wrong with a new Halo game for the holiday season despite the hiccups from the last release as well as new editions of Tomb Raider and Fable which will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>competitive on Black Friday even if Oculus and HoloLens are likely not going to be ready in time for the Christmas rush As such <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>remains a long play into just like it was after the Oculus release but now there is a lot more upside than previously thought given the renewed commitment to games and the importance Windows will have going forward Gaming is now a central component of Microsofts mission and the events of the past week show the company wants to be the gaming company of the future Source Microsofts Great Leap Forward In Gaming Disclosure The author has no positions
