expansion We predict international markets will continue to drive Fords profit higher as investments continue to bear fruit We have been writing about Ford NYSE F for the better part of the last year and a half Despite what we believe to be decent news and great operational numbers from the company the stock has yet to respond You can clearly see the divergence over the last year in the amount of sales the company is booking versus the price that equity markets have assigned to its common stock We think this is due to an irrational fear of the auto credit markets We think these markets will likely turn as we are heading toward the end of a debt cycle but weve presented an idea to short CACC as a pair trade with F for investors worried about this impact Fords valuation now prices in catastrophe which we dont think is a realistic scenario Thus we believe Ford to continue to be undervalued Again this morning we have great news about the companys operations overseas and some renewed hope with an investment in a cloud services company but the market will likely shrug this off and the common stock remains a value in our opinion This morning Ford announced that sales in China were up for the month Sales have again been led by SUVs and Ford continues to execute internationally Ford announces sales in China were up in April to vehicles with SUV demand strong Sales at the Changan Ford Automobiles JV rose YY to vehicles while sales fell for the Jiangling Motor JV to vehicles YTD Ford sales in China are up to vehicles led by a strong performance by the Escort model The company just posted a fantastic quarter and CEO Mark Fields has been dripping with confidence over his last few public appearances We have continued to state that international growth is going to be paramount for Ford The company has shown us time and time again since the auto crisis that it can execute here in the United States It has also shown us that it can innovate with its new endeavor in the aluminum Ford F The company has done a good job returning capital to shareholders issuing a billion special dividend and the company is also prudently investing in its growth globally which we like to see versus buying back a lot of stock In short the company is trying to conquer the entire global automotive market Admirable goals that seem to be moving in the right direction for the company With domestic sales as its backbone we think Fords push for profitability in other countries will be the sole driver that helps it continue to exceed earnings expectations moving forward The companys valuation at this point is pricing in total failure and total disaster in the auto financing market In addition to the great news of China it was also announced this morning that Ford was making a million investment in Pivotal a silicon valley based cloud services company alongside names like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Ford had also recently committed over billion in China to help research and develop smart cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as you may remember already was once a partner with Ford and has helped it with its SYNC incar automated system for use inside vehicles We believe this commitment to automation and evolving the companys products will continue to literally pay dividends for Ford moving forward So what kind of valuation do we get for this great news F EV to Revenues TTM data by YCharts As you can see Fords valuation seems ridiculously low Its worth mentioning the billion in debts the company currently has on its balance sheet but its valuation of x forward earnings and an EVsales of x leaves room for some conservative multiple expansion Granted auto companies dont get premium multiples but Fords valuation is so low that we can easily see a scenario for upside should operations continue to impress This China news wraps up a couple of impressive quarters Looking forward Fords continued investments in itself pave the way for an even more impressive future With Fords steady dividend and continued confidence in its operations we believe that the company is operating with the perfect mixture of innovation and operational execution Ford continues to pay an attractive dividend and as we have seen the company is not opposed to returning more capital to shareholders For those with a multiple year longterm outlook we continue to believe that Ford is an attractive investment at these levels Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
