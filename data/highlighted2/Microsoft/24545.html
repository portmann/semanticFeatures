rather biggest dud It all really depends on who you ask As for the actual eyewitness truth and the reason why everyone who took AAPL from to on hopes that the New Paranormal Casio will be the greatest thing since sliced bread here it is Scene Apple Store th Ave NY Its quiet as it should be Ppl can see applewatch today but cant get em yet pictwittercomDxWUMEGy Ed Baig edbaig April A line of OVER A

out to people calling Bitcoiners iTards etc that Apple has been one of the biggest antagonists against Bitcoin So if you hate Bitcoin you are in good company with Apple Fri smithcreek Fri El Oregonian Fri Thirst Mutilator Fri Thirst Mutilator Fri Thirst Mutilator Let it be proclaimed for all time that ON THIS DAY April The following events occured will therefore be inexcorably linked They were showing polling numbers over the weekend that claim she is beating every current and potential Republican candidate I know doesnt really matter which team jersey the new boss wears But cmon could yall be a little less obvious Hell Its prolly about time for Chelsea to pop out a puppy that has an uncanny resemblance to Webb Hubbell Fri Ghordius I still like some fewproducts from Apple but I do find it strange how often Im asked Gosh You still have that oldest version And this in Europe mind you on the other side recently Apple flopped catastrophically with too many things imho as much as the newer Kindles which seem to become less and less what readers want but be serious despite the stock valuation its still a company that seems to attract the ire of many just because it symbolizes a Latte and hipster lifestyle and we encounter even here enough real damn political propaganda the real McCoy of propaganda to call commercial PR this way just my two cents including that if you buy them on credit and the newest one again on credit and then the newest one again on credit then you might want to pause and reflect Fri Harrison No I think it has everything to do with Apple announcing that there wont be any instore sales for the watches So people cant wait in line and walk home with one to play with Therefore no lines Fri MarketTruth Appleswatch is TWO generations behind the curve of current offerings within the marketplace That might be part of the problem Fri pods I will buy one of these when I can speak into it and a Trans Am comes and saves my ass Fri ozzzzo Fri pods Guy I went to high school picked up a mint GS Stage I from get this a little old lady he did work for Fri MaxMax Thats a cool car In tenth grade I had a friend that picked me up in a hot rod Camaro which was the nd fastest car in the town There was a GSX that was faster and could leave grooves in the street Fri DeadFred How is this thing supposed to be better than the Android Wear watch My brotherinlaw was showing off his Wear a couple months ago and I found it underwhelming Theyd better hope the herd thing works for them I for one will keep my watch sefely in my phone in my pocket like the good Lord intended it It is probably VERY quiet this morning at Apple HQ Fri dicksburnt TheApple iWatch will go down in history as the lasttoken from the great period of overconsumerism In the future as studentsperusetheir history books on this chapter we are living now long after we are dead therewill be a small photo of thegolden iWatch Fri Super Broccoli Fri pods Im going to wait until next year when they come out with one more line of dots on the face Fri prefan Why would I want a watch dangling from my wrist where I can bang it into stuff and break it when I have a cell phone that can do the same things has a bigger screen and can be safely tucked away from the elements and from banging it against things Maybe Im an old fart but I dont get why anyone would want this product I predict its sales will greatly underwhelm Fri ghengis Precisely why my wife buys me polished SS Fossil watches at Target I bang it against shit all the time during the day Tells time looks decent and if I smash it or scrape it up just toss and replace No need to smash a smartphone or ding up the expensive watches that get worn a handful of times per year In order to stimulate sales of the Apple Watch Apple has announced its latest iOS update will remove the clock and Apple iTunes will restrict all clockwatch applications from being downloaded on its devicesoh except for the new Apple Watch
