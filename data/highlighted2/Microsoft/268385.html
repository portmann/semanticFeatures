bigger addressable market with less competition and big barriers to entry Retail an important driver but cloud something special and new in the land of investing Cloud AWS was of profits last quarter and growing much faster than the overall business Our earnings predictions are higher than the Street for Q and and feel Amazon should be strategically bought if there is bad news that gets the stock down Amazon NASDAQ AMZN likely reports earnings in late January Until then many if not most investors will be focused on the consumer environment and the potential retail results That said we think the financial makeup of Amazon is changing drastically to one focused much more on cloud computing services We think analysts need to shift a great deal of attention and understanding to AWS Amazon Web Services the companys cloud offering instead of spending time solely understanding retail Last quarter cloud made up less than of revenues but more than of profits Topline growth was versus the rest of the businesses excluding AWS at The margins at AWS are tracking at as of last quarter The entire business excluding AWS this year is expected show roughly segment operating margins The nice thing is that the core retail business seems to be hitting the operating leverage driving flow through to earnings Even if the top line is growing much slower the profits could actually keep pace with the cloud business as Amazon is finally seeing leverage on the fixedcost expense But as for valuation the cloud business is deserving of a much greater piece of the companys overall valuation given the current statistics and potential market size The company thinks that the business can grow but it is running faster than that To be a player in cloud a company needs a lot of money to invest in technology architecture software people etc AMZN already needed to do it itself by building out its oneofakind online retail business From that investment the company realized that the scale and knowhow can be offered to other players There are many other players in this field including Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Oracle NYSE ORCL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT etc The one issue is that Amazon claims to already have over x the computing capacity of its next competitors combined If you are a GE or Cap One or any bank or business with missioncritical applications you need reliability security and scale Based on its size and firstmover positioning AMZN is winning this business Forrester Research says this business could be B by years from now Amazon thinks ultimately there are only going to be a few main players capturing the major customers due to their reliability and security A customers number one issue is security Amazon needs to deal with that for its online business every day and so has been seen as a reliable source so far If Amazon ends up getting a position as one of the lead players in this industry were adding another B to revenues in five years at EBIT margins How Is The Market Putting A Value On The Businesses Our Guess X AWS A Few Years Out x For Retail Heres some math to think about how to get to the Amazons value and what the market is pricing for its businesses As a caveat all of these numbers are malleable and you can do the math yourself to see where the valuation can go with your own inputs As another important comment we do not think that growth companies can be shorted based on valuation so if you happen to get to a lower valuation unless something goes wrong with the company most growth companies grow into their valuation To be short on a highvaluation company one needs to expect something to go wrong Currently there are scale advantages and a limited number of companies with capital to enter and with Amazons large lead we gave it a nice market share of all of these figures we cant know for sure we are just estimating and modeling Our profit margins of are based on the companys current recently but understanding that just like Q of it may drop at any time to take another huge jump in market share AMZN may also have to invest heavily in the business like its done with Amazon The company is no longer only growing one business on AWS it is growing all of its customers and new customers which will require investment Our bias though is that margins go up from over time But again there is no way to know yet We gave the company a multiple on that business five years out and discounted it four years at All these numbers can be played with We think in actuality how markets work is if these numbers prove correct then the multiple will be higher as they grow into the multiple Here again there is no way to know so we chose You can then see the value should be for AWS today in that Amazon stock price The rest we give to retailonline Taking our which arent far from the Street estimates we get about x earnings for the retailonline business for the next year If we look out to and assume another EPS growth of x then the multiple becomes a more normal x But if Amazon keeps the growth rate and now profit leverage the multiple could likely end up being higher than that As we went through this process our price did not end up far from the current price when plugging in our own numbers Given the growth rates of the company we feel the price of Amazon does not seem unfair We think the price has been decided by sizable investors who have done a similar runthrough and made an extra decision that Amazon is a market leader that will unlikely get moved from its position for many years Shorter Term We Have Upside In Q In line for Q We are Higher For When trying to figure out what Q Q and can be we used the recent trends and seasonality and broke it down by business For retail there is a big jump sequentially in the fourth quarter and Q comes back down That said the retailonline Q growth rate should slow as it did last year from Q Most of the drivers for top line have been allyear drivers smoothing out the quarterly revenue trajectory They have been driven by Prime which is an allyear sales subscription clothes and food which are more all year and less giftable than their onetime core business of music and books We allow for this in our nonAWS retail growth rate estimates The growth rate should pick back up in Q although we kept the growth rate the same For margins in Q we assumed an average of the jump in sequential margins from Q to Q last year as well as figuring the margin improvement year over year from the recent Q We get about upside for Q versus the last couple of quarters upside of North American retail margin has grown by bp this year The Street is assuming some continuation next year We have a bp improvement in Q which may be conservative and are still higher than the Street We say this may be conservative because Q is the companys core quarter with the most margin potential where its distribution centers run at the highest utilization which should drive the highest margins For next year you can see in the model there is upside potential versus the Street estimates We have on average ct upside surprise per quarter We like that Amazon has focused its communication around cash flow We think that is an important message that means we are in a period of growth and profits flowing through We know AMZN has been notorious for spending back upside which we thoroughly respect We also saw that after Q of the margins of AWS dropped from to Q to Q because the company decided to drop price and invest more The company has said that it expects the AWS business to be lumpy Lumpy means it can drop the price again or ramp up spending to maintain its lead This was part of Amazons strategy for many years with distribution centers then content Fire phones etc Its worked and we expect it to constantly push to find new investments That said AMZNs investments seem to be driven based on the greater good of the overall company and customer offering AWS was a little different that it realized it already built something so special that the company might as well make a business out of it There are other highmultiple companies that saw multiple depression from nonstrategic investments That has not been the case with Amazon because its investments have been on point with its overall strategy Overall we are obviously impressed with Amazon We think because of the markets there could be a bull and bear tug of war here Ultimately we think the bulls win as this is a oneofakind company in a rare premium position both in retail and cloud We believe that AMZN is a longerterm buy and can be bought after the bad news has cleared whenever that happens Whenever investors are disappointed that they decided to increase spending or drop price and the stock takes a hit there is a strong value support story and positioning to step in That said we would look for bad news entries to manage through the longer term If one doesnt use scary dips to buy he could get shaken out on those scary dips making this a losing investment So far Amazon has proven to push its business model to discover new opportunities AWS fell into its lap based on the companys online buildout need and it made sense to resell the capacity and turn it into a business AMZN is getting accolades for its content That said a lot of its new endeavors dont automatically have a great ROI or are profitable at all especially at first When the company invested heavily in distribution centers the typical flow through visibility was initially missing to the Street on how it would play out In the end we see its working but the process took years That said AMZN can find something else to invest in that investors dont get As we mentioned before it could take huge swaths out of its price in AWS or do a massive distribution buildout in a new region These moves would slow operating leverage and potentially hold back or lower earnings expectations This is the biggest and real risk The other clear risk is the market Going into a rising rate environment the potentially biggest hit stocks are those with high multiples That said often times a market advance thins out to only the best players causing a thin dichotomy between a few great ones like Amazon performing and the rest weak In any case investing in a highmultiple stock when everything is already pretty clearly working cant have the ranch bet Investors always need to be humble and thats why we say to use weakness to find opportunities to enter Chaim specializes
