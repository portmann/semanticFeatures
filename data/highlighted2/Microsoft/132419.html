class='textDiv'>The Pros Cons Of Windows Sharing Your WiFi Passwords With Your Contacts Consumerist Whoops It looks like portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator All around the world today Windows users are updating their operating systems to Windows better known as Microsofts attempt to atone for the sins of Windows However the newest version of Windows has a feature that is either depending on who you speak to a huge privacy concern or maybe not that big a deal The feature dubbed WiFi Sense shares an encrypted version of a users WiFi network password with their Skype Outlook and possibly Facebook contacts The sharing with Skype and Outlook contact is by default while the user must opt in to share with Facebook contacts The contacts never actually see the password which is stored remotely on a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>server but if they ever come within reach of your WiFi network theyll be able to log on Cybersecurity expert and journalist Brian Krebs is skeptical about the safeguards that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has claimed to build into the WiFi sense The company says your contacts will only be able to share your network access and that WiFi Sense will block those users from accessing any other shared resources on your network including computers file shares or other devices he writes But these words of assurance probably ring hollow for anyone whos been paying attention to security trends over the past few years Given the myriad ways in which social networks and associated applications share and intertwine personal connections and contacts its doubtful that most people are aware of who exactly all of their social network followers really are from one day to the next After all hackers with a goal are not easily deterred by roadblocks put in their way Just look at the Home Depot payment terminal breach The hackers in that case used phishing emails to access the credentials of a thirdparty airconditioning contractor for the retailer Whats to stop someone from deceiving a user into adding them to their contacts Microsofts argument is that WiFi Sense is actually safer than simply giving your friends your WiFi password whenever they come to visit The idea is that its more secure to grant contacts access to the network without ever having to give them the password than it is to explicitly share your password with them Once someone has the actual password it can be shared with others or possibly used to figure out other passwords for websites and services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>claims that your WiFi Sense contacts have no way to pass your passwords on to others <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also says that WiFi Sense will not share passwords for networks secured with authentication protocols like x EAP meaning most corporate networks would not be included But if your business uses a more simple wireless network thats similar to what youd find in a typical home environment WiFi Sense is probably not a good idea Over at Forbescom Amit Chowdry acknowledged the concerns of WiFi Sense but said he believes the benefits outweigh the risks This feature lets your friends access your WiFi network without having to actually tell them your password Sometimes people use the same password for their email and WiFi network which could be a major privacy risk if their friends are nosy he writes WiFi Sense also makes connecting to your WiFi network less of a hassle if your password is extra long with a variety of letters numbers and symbols And WiFi Sense does not actually show your WiFi password at all But that seems to bring up the concern about the fact that all these network passwords are going to be stored by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>That has to be a tempting target for hackers hoping to access all that information Depending on Microsofts infosec protocols this is either completely fine and dandy or a potential goldmine for wardriving hackers writes Ars Technicas Sebastian Anthony Again as long as you dont share the passkey from your workplaces WiFi network the potential security risk is low People wanting to avoid having anything to do with WiFi Sense can do two things Opt out of the feature on Windows and change the name of their wireless router The first is the easiest Simply go to Change WiFi settings on your computer then click Manage WiFi settings where you can turn the feature off To keep anyone from using WiFi Sense to access your home network change the SSID of your network by adding _optout to the end So if your network name is ChrisIsAwesome youd change it

Offers Data At GB Will Credit You For Unused Data Google Slaps Air Pollution Monitoring Systems On Street View Cars In SanFrancisco If the base intention is to make it both easier when your friends come by to connect to your WiFi and to eliminate the necessity of telling someone a password to type in wouldnt a better solution be to encourage a program where the encrypted form of the password is printed in a QR code and the phone tablet or laptop could scan the code and use it Then you not only have the original intentions met but the added benefit of having to be granted physical access to the building rather than have the password floating around for everyone anytime anywhere Walmart Ending Overnight Shopping Hours At More Hour Stores Filmmakers Claim To Have Conclusive Proof Against
