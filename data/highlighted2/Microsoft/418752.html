rent out Nvidiapowered computers to corporations who want to run deep learning software in the cloud Nvidia is a pioneer and undisputed leader in GPUaccelerated artificial intelligence computing Shareholders of Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA should welcome the news that Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is increasing its presence in cloudbased artificial intelligence compute services Amazon Web Services AWS will rent out computers powered by up to eight Nvidia GPUs to companies who want to run cloudbased deep learning or artificial intelligence AI software The Bloomberg article also mentioned that a single artificial intelligence software could utilize up to computers Amazon will likely become a major buyer of Nvidias new Tesla P GPU Nvidia spent billion on Research Development to make the Tesla P Nvidia specifically created the Tesla P to accelerate deep learning and artificial intelligence computing With billion transistors the Tesla P can learn incoming data x faster than previous Nvidia GPUs Amazon is definitely impressed with Nvidias promise of Infinite Compute for the Tesla P The Tesla P touts up to x performance boost for data center applications Nvidia has longterm benefits from Amazons ambition to compete with the deep learning services of Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and International Business Machines NYSE IBM Alphabet is now renting out its Google Cloud Platform to developers who want to use machine learning computers IBM already touts a long list of cognitive or deep learning cloudbased apps powered by its Watson machine learning software <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is also getting its feet wet on cloudbased artificial intelligence These companies are all rivals of Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing Amazon already wrote to its shareholders that it expects to make billion in revenue from AWS this year Adding Nvidiapowered artificial intelligence services will definitely help AWS keep its leadership position over cloud computing Tractica estimates that artificial intelligence for enterprise applications alone could have a market value of billion by As the current leader in enterprise cloud computing AWS has vested interests to keep its clients loyal Amazon can and should offer its own forrent deep learning computers Amazon will also have to buy more Nvidia GPUs to meet the demand of machine learningpowered Big Data Analytics Artificial Intelligence plays a big role in Big Data Analytics becoming a billionyear business by Amazons choice of Nvidia GPUs for its custom machine learning enterprise computers is a big endorsement Other companies might follow Amazons choice of Nvidia GPUs for their deep learning computers Nvidia itself sells the Tesla Ppowered DGX Deep Learning System computer The cheapest version of DGX sells for Debtladen Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD has great Radeon GPUs but it never had any extra money for RD to create AIspecific GPUs Nvidia has spent billions to make its GPUs the goto processors for artificial intelligence Nvidia therefore has an early monopoly on GPUaccelerated artificial intelligence computers This big advantage makes NVDA a better longterm investment than AMD For the last three years Nvidias stock has outperformed AMD I expect this trend to continue for many years to come Selling very expensive Tesla P GPUs or DGX deep learning computers is a strong tailwind for Nvidia AMD is still stuck making GPUs for gamers Nvidia has already moved on to selling GPUs for hyperscale deep learning computers I firmly believe that Amazon will buy tons of Nvidia GPUs for its machinelearning computers Yes Amazon buys custom Xeon processors from Intel NASDAQ INTC for its server farms However GPUs are proven to be much faster than x CPUs when it comes to deep learning Below is a screenshot of an article from Domino Data Lab explaining why GPUs are better suited for deep learning tasks Facebook NASDAQ FB and IBM are now also using Nvidia GPUs to accelerate their own deep learning frameworks Facebook uses GPUs in neural networks for its Open AI project Furthermore Nvidia also has potential revenue stream from affluent people buying their own deep learning workstations Exxact Corporation sells consumerlevel deep learning computers powered by four Nvidia Titan X GPUs I would love to own a deep learning computer that can help me beat Komodo or Stockfish chess engines Nvidias big lead in GPUaccelerated deep learning computers makes it a worthy longterm investment It doesnt really matter which firm becomes the top dog in cloudbased artificial intelligence services Nvidia is still going to sell lots of its GPUs to Google Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>IBM and Facebook The only threat to Nvidias early lead in deep learning processors is Altera Intel paid billion to acquire FPGAmaker Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>found out that FPGAs Field Programmable Gate Arrays could help Intel Xeon CPUs catch up with GPUs when it comes to specific artificial intelligence workload Microsofts research suggest that scaling up a neural network using Xeon E and Arria GX FPGAs could eventually match the performance of GPUaccelerated deep learning computers Unfortunately for Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still using Nvidia GPUs for its Computational Network Toolkit CNTK This goes to show that FPGAs future in artificial intelligence is still years away from commercial adoption <span

investors just how great Nvidias future is in deep learning Nvidias GPus are compatible with all major frameworks of artificial intelligence Disclosure I amwe are long NVDA INTC MSFT GOOG AMZN I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in
