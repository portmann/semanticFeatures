ETFs by asset class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub Apr AM ET About International Business Machines Corporation IBM Includes AMZN GOOG GOOGL MSFT by Brian Nichols IBM announced new cloud services on Tuesday and even stole The Weather Channel from AMZN as a customer IBMs plan to incorporate underutilized data to improve enterprise operations might sound innovative but in reality it wont be for long IBMs plan to invest billion might also sound encouraging but IBM is playing from behind with the slowest cloud growth and minimal organic growth IBM NYSE IBM announced a plan to invest billion over the next four years to bolster its Internet of Things IoT offerings Specifically IBM wants to help clients use the of data collected by devices thats never used IBMs first test subject in its IoTdata analytics initiative is a partnership with The Weather Channel to use its billion discrete forecasts per day to help businesses that are impacted by the weather make better decisions In essence this could be a meaningful relationship for IBM but more importantly is that its seen as a big loss for Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN because The Weather Channel was previously a partner with its cloud business AWS So the big question becomes whether cloud leader Amazon should be worried Amazon controls nearly of the worldwide cloud infrastructure services market which grew yearoveryear i n and finished with nearly billion in total revenue during the fourth quarter according to Synergy Research In retrospect it is a small market relative to the size of the companies that control it Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT IBM and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL but with AWS valued at billion its an industry with very high longterm expectations Therefore with Amazoncom being the unquestioned leader in cloud infrastructure services it might seem like quite a big deal for IBM which controls of the market to steal a major customer But in reality its no big deal nor is the initiative a game changer for IBMs cloud business While IBM might be the first company to combine cloud infrastructure services and big data analytics with future plans for IoT it wont be the last For example Amazons AWS was founded in several years before competing platforms IBM essentially bought its cloud business whereas Microsofts Azure was homegrown before launching in Yet today there are very few distinguishing products and services from each service provider In essence storage is storage apps are apps and data is data regardless of whose platform is being used The key is to combine different productsservices and innovate to appeal to different customers in more useful ways but it doesnt take long for competitors to catch up Its for this reason that an all out price war started in late and ran throughout most of Companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google were trying to gain market share while Amazon was trying to keep it therefore cutting prices on countless key services to do so Had one company actually had a distinguished product or service a game changer of sorts the need to cut prices would not have been so prevalent That company would have had a better competitive angle than cutting prices and ultimately slowing revenue growth In other words this news from IBM is not that big of a deal as it wont take long for Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google among others to start offering similar services and attacking the same market In fact IBM is actually at a disadvantage because its cloud platform is mostly acquired meaning it was never built from the ground up and optimized as one service Instead IBMs cloud is just a big collection of services under different names Amazoncom offers all of its cloud services through AWS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>on Azure While IBMs cloud services are diverse it still sells some services like infrastructureasaservice as SoftLayer and markets platformasaservice as SAP and Oracles NYSE ORCL applications That said I find it hard to believe that IBM can do something that Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Google or salesforcecom NYSE CRM cant do on the cloud regardless of how much money it spends IBM has already spent nearly billion over the last few years to improve its cloud offerings and while its cloud infrastructure services revenue grew yearoveryear during the fourth quarter it underperformed Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google in growth its hard to know how much of its growth is organic In a cloud industry thats growing fast organic growth is the true measure of success and right now we have to assume that not much of IBMs cloud growth is organic due to acquisitions Furthermore thats a trend that is likely to continue due to its commitment to investment billion likely to be acquisitions In other words despite IBM taking The Weather Channel it is hardly a longterm threat to Amazon or even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft
