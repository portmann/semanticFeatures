employee could be a useful metric in security analysis Software is a key battlefield of business competition Rewind back to Facebooks NASDAQ FB April Bn acquisition of Instagram It seemed to many at the time an astronomical price to pay for an month old startup with just employees After all that billion dollar dream team could fit inside an elevator Citigroup now values Instagram at Bn Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unequivocally proved the doubters wrong with what is now widely considered to have been a brilliant acquisition After being turned down by Snapchat Mr Zuckerberg went on to acquire employee WhatsApp for Bn in February While the wisdom of that acquisition has yet to be decided it proves the almost limitless price a company will pay for brand equity and an automated business model Its a paradox that some of the most successful companies in terms of shareholder value are the smallest in terms of employment Towering offices overflowing with employees were forever the hallmark of corporate success These days in an era of super lean postrecession enterprises and inside the world of management consulting its often seen as a failure a failure to automate and outsource to cut salary expense One notable exception with regards to the general unwillingness of companies to hire is technology companies which are in need of highskill workers Facebook and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL say they cannot get enough top engineers to meet their needs Mr Zuckerberg has said Facebook hires as many qualified engineers as it can find His policy appears in part aimed at keeping talent away from the competition and preparing for future needs Facebook and Google relative to their market capitalization still employ very few workers They are among the ranks of what we term jobless companies which is the focus of this article The internet and software are by and large behind the increasing automation of companies The internet is fueling the outsourcing of tasks on a global basis and software development is automating all nature of logical tasks Software has undeniably become a major battlefield of business competition The right software can assist nearly any business to do what they do even better Often this software is internetlinked such as with web apps and mobile apps For this reason many businesses in disparate industries have evolved into part software businesses The generally conservative BLS predicts a growth in the employment of software developers from Thats a lot of work getting automated by software Accounting analytics market research marketing and financial to name a few As a developer myself I know that harnessing software can have powerful results but still has a lot of execution risk Creating useful software is far easier said than done It takes a whole lot of mentally challenging highskill labor to automate business tasks This labor is also very expensive for corporations with the median salary for USbased software developers at over Nonetheless a good software developer can produce enormous value for a corporation literally hundreds of thousands to millions in yearly value Software also never wears out can work and never asks for a raise Thats why developers are in such demand WisdomTree Investments NASDAQ WETF is the maker of popular exchange traded funds and Goodyear Tire NASDAQ GT makes tires and fixes cars through a network of highquality service stations Goodyear creates value primarily through manufacturing manual labor transporting goods and the location advantages of its network of service stations It actually makes something tires and its service technicians can repair your car quickly It employs a small army of laborers Its a company your grandfather would understand A SP index member with a Bn market cap and not a jobless company WisdomTree creates value by making and maintaining ETFs Just two of its ETFs the NYSEARCA HEDJ and the NYSEARCA DXJ account for Bn of its recently surpassed Bn in AUM WidsomTree doesnt create anything in the physical sense Its an idea company Its just one good idea away from its next blockbuster ETF Despite its not insignificant market cap of Bn it employs just people Its a jobless company So despite having just employees WisdomTree has roughly half the market capitalization of Goodyear Tire a company with employees Jobless companies have small wellcompensated and highlyskilled workforces They leverage technology heavily in their businesses Their business models are uniquely vulnerable to technological change but they also derive much of their profits from the harnessing of technology The future of their business rests upon the generation of ideas and technological breakthroughs Their growth is less constrained by the laws of physics and more constrained by their ability to recruit talent and convert good ideas into popular new products and services Jobless companies tend to have very high brand equity Sound familiar Apple NASDAQ AAPL Facebook and Google are all in the ranks of jobless companies If we take a companys market cap and divide it by the number of employees we get the market cap per employee The higher this number the more jobless the company is We begin with Goodyear Its certainly not a jobless company with a K Market Cap Per Employee ratio A personnel intensive business due to the nature of manufacturing and exporting tires globally Facebook is the poster child of low employment tech companies with a staggering K Market Cap Per Employee Facebook employs Google is a heavily automated low employment to shareholder value company GOOGL shares have a K Market Cap Per Employee ratio Google employs Netflix NASDAQ NFLX is a heavily technological company as indicated by a Market Cap Per Employee of K It employs Hewlett Packard NYSE HPQ is a computer conglomerate with a globally based workforce of It has a Market Cap Per Employee of K which is very low for a technology company It is under the skillful leadership of exEbay NASDAQ EBAY CEO Meg Whitman HP has been hurt by the decline in the PC market and shift to cloudbased enterprise IT applications HP is planning a split into two public entities HewlettPackardEnterprise and HP Inc These two entities would have a narrower business focus Darden NYSE DRI employs with a Market Cap Per Employee of K This ratio puts it at the bottom of the SP A labor intensive business IBM NYSE IBM employs and has a Market Cap Per Employee of K which is similar to Starbucks Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB has a or stake in IBM According to research by McKinsey and Company IBMs profits are driven more by the size of its workforce and less by the productivity of its workforce IBM has significantly underperformed over the last few years Intel NASDAQ INTC employs and has a Market Cap Per Employee of K As a hardware company it is a more research and capital intensive business than software focused companies such as Yahoo and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>I created a sample jobless portfolio with of the SPs stocks with the highest jobless ratios excluding REITs I excluded REITs because they have low numbers of employees due to being holding companies not technology companies These stocks are This jobless portfolio outperformed the SP by an extremely wide margin over the last year Further analysis is warranted on whether this outperformance is due to the jobless companies picked already having high valuations by definition due the concentrated portfolio of just stocks or whether jobless companies are being inefficiently priced by the market at large For curiositys sake I took some of the lowest market cap per employee companies of the SP and created a portfolio of these heavily labor intensive companies These companies are As seen with Instagram jobless companies have large and rapid appreciation potential On the negative jobless companies may not have the staying power and durability of business models that blue chips do Knowingly or not I believe many investors will experience some of their largest portfolio gains from the purchase of shares in reasonably valued jobless companies I believe active equity investors should formulate a sensible longterm strategy with regards to jobless companies Holdings of certain jobless companies may be appropriate for some aggressive growth investors Shares of jobless companies may be avoided by some retirees investing for income due to their general lack of dividends and volatility Salary expense as percent of revenue varies widely by industry yet often is a major corporate expense Jobless companies are far less encumbered by salary expense and have powerful business models Jobless companies have successfully harnessed technology and by and large have superior growth prospects They can afford to pay for and hoard top talent They do more with less workforce and more capital Jobless companies
