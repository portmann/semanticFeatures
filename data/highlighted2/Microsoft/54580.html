is one of the components of Microsofts cloud Office subscriptions grew during the last quarter significantly slower than Microsofts cloud growth of over the period The availability of the service via

users will now be able to access the platform directly via a private link to Equinix NASDAQ EQIX data canters starting from the third quarter of the current year The private link will enable Office customers to use Azure ExpressRoute to establish a managed connection to the Office platforms that will yield highquality performance and more reliability while eliminating latency issues that are common with public clouds The ExpressRouteEquinix Office private link will be available in markets initially Washington DC Tokyo Sydney Singapore Silicon Valley Seattle Osaka New York Los Angeles London Hong Kong Dallas Chicago Atlanta and Amsterdam The move by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could be the first among a series of potentially similar moves by the company and can go a long way to helping the company realize its cloud ambitions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is unquestionably at the forefront of the ongoing enterprise transition from the onpremise service delivery model to a cloudbased model The companys cloud is currently the fastest growing Microsofts cloud revenue grew during the last quarter the only major public cloud to record tripledigit growth Microsofts cloud revenue which consists of Azure Dynamics CRM and Office brought in revenue of billion during the quarter placing it on an annual runrate of billion Theres an article that I recently published on Seeking Alpha wherein I discussed the revenue and gross margins of the three different components of Microsofts cloud I worked out the revenue and gross margins during the quarter for as follows Office revenue of billion gross margin of Dynamics CRM revenue of billion gross margin of You will notice that Office currently has the lowest gross margin among the three <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cloud segments This probably has something to do with the fact that Office comes with several perks including GB free OneDrive storage Skype minutes per month for landline calls and free web hosting with applicable tools Considering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offers free OneDrive storage for the first GB and month for the next GB the company could be potentially foregoing tens of millions of dollars on the free GB OneDrive storage offer for Office every quarter A single Home Premium version of Office also can be shared by up to five users This means that many homes probably only use a single copy of the product Barrons however pointed out that gross margins for Office are likely to gradually rise to approach the gross margins that are typical of SaaS companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has big cloud ambitions The company recently revealed that it has a target to reach billion in annual cloud revenues by Considering that Microsofts cloud is currently on a billion annual runrate this means that the company is banking on its cloud to maintain a CAGR through This is easier said than done since the law of large numbers catches up with you rather quickly when you grow that big At that level Microsofts Dynamics CRM division alone will be about bigger than Salesforcecom NYSE CRM the largest CRM company For this kind of growth to become a reality all the three components of Microsofts cloud have to be firing on all cylinders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does not usually break down the individual cloud components To arrive at those revenue figures I used the cloud growth figures provided by Synergy Research for Azure and Microsofts CRM market share provided by Gartner to estimate the revenue of Dynamics CRM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>however does provide the number of subscriptions for Office The company said that it finished the quarter with million Office subscribers Viewed in isolation that number looks impressive But when you dig a bit deeper you start realizing that its nowhere nearly as impressive as it first appears to be For starters the number of subscribers grew just which is probably a good indicator of revenue growth for the segment revenue growth means that Office grew much slower than either Azure or Dynamics CRM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>revealed in that it had about million OneDrive subscribers of which about were paying customers subscribers with more than GB of storage Given the robust growth of Azure OneDrive subscribers could have hit the million mark by now or close to million paying customers million Office subscribers pales in comparison to this figure After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>typically sells hundreds of millions of new Windows OS copies every year Its quite clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still has plenty of room to run as far as the adoption of Office goes The move by the company to offer a private link to Office appears to be targeted at netting more enterprise customers Despite the rapid uptake of cloud services by enterprise customers security issues are still cited by many as the biggest reason why they are reluctant to shift entire workloads to the cloud A private link to Equinixs cloud exchange for Office will eliminate most of these worries for this group of customers Organizations already use Microsofts AzureConnect to build their hybrid clouds The new private link now allows them to access one of Microsofts most popular products in a much more secure and reliable way Its very likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will soon roll out private link services for its other cloud products as well in a bid to accelerate cloud adoption in order for the company to realize its ambitious cloud goals Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Private Cloud Access For Office Will Accelerate Cloud Adoption Disclosure The author
