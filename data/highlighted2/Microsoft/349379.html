Alpha Bottom line Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT development of a special Windows China government edition reflects efforts western tech firms are making to comply with Beijings yearold national security law US software giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is sending the latest sign that foreign tech firms are bending to Beijings national security concerns with word that it has created a special version of Windows just for the Chinese government This kind of a move looks relatively bold and sharply contrasts with Apples NASDAQ AAPL recent refusal to assist the US government in its drive to unlock a terrorists iPhone But Microsofts move isnt completely unprecedented either since the software giant also made a similar move more than a decade ago when it released the source code for Windows to Beijing Since then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has continued to share its Windows source code with Beijing for newer versions of the operating system reflecting the importance the company places on the huge China market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is hardly the only foreign tech company to bend to Beijings growing obsession with national security which culminated with its rollout of a new wideranging law last year Foreign tech giants complained that the law was overly invasive by forcing them to release sensitive product information to national security officials and also by pressuring them to form joint ventures with local partners for governmentrelated projects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>formed its own joint venture as part of that campaign announcing a tieup with local electronics and information technology company CETC last fall to address Beijings national security concerns The company has had a stormy relationship with other Chinese government agencies over the last two years being probed in separate cases for tax evasion and anticompetitive behavior previous post Against all that backdrop lets look at the latest reports that say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has prepared the special edition of Windows just for Beijing and that the edition will soon be rolled out for use in government agencies and at major staterun companies Chinese article The reports come from an interview with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Greater China chief Ralph Haupter who says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>teamed up with CETC on the project That means the partners were able to develop this new Windows edition in a relatively short time In all of these cases its quite clear that the Chinese partner is probably bringing very little to the partnership in terms of technology Instead these Chinese companies are acting more as a buffer between Beijing and the foreigners As major and probably majority stakeholders in these new joint ventures such local partners would also be far more likely to bend to Beijings requests for sensitive information Microsofts case is a good example since CETC owns percent of the venture and thus gets the final say on any major decisions Haputer said the special Windows edition adds features that make it easier to manage and also more secure while also eliminating some features targeted at consumers I suspect that one of Microsofts biggest modifications involved simply adding some backdoors that also will give national security officials better access to the system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was just the latest company to form a local joint venture to placate Beijing Others who have formed similar recent tieups include the likes of HP Inc NYSE HPQ IBM NYSE IBM Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and VMware NYSE VMW just to name a few previous post We havent really heard what the others have done in terms of similar product modifications but I suspect many may also be adding backdoors and other features that give Beijing better access to monitor networks built with their products These companies really didnt have much choice in the matter and were told to form alliances and modify their products or risk losing work from Chinese government agencies big stateowned enterprises At the end of the day I have to commend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for at least being open in talking about what its doing to placate Beijing even if the move is quite unprecedented and could give China access to sensitive product information All of these companies have made a choice that the Chinese market is too big to risk losing and hopefully they wont ultimately regret that decision Tagged Technology Application Software Expert Insight </div></body></html>
