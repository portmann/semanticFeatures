class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Wants More TopGrossing iOS And Android Apps On Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced yesterday that Windows will let iOS and Android developers port their apps a lot more easily to WinNET code Microsofts Project Underwood would let iOS developers quickly transform their ObjectiveC appsgames to run on Windows Android developers can upload the APK version of their apps to Windows App Store and Project Astoria will convert them to work on Windows devices The biggest news at yesterdays BUILD event is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT will make it easier for developers to port their apps to the Windows platform King Digital NYSE KING used Microsofts Project Astoria and Project Underwood tools to quickly port Candy Crush Saga to Windows Phone last December Project Underwood is a tool for ObjectiveC programmers who create apps for the iOS platform Developers can use Microsofts Visual Studio to quickly recompile their iOS apps to run on Windows computers and mobile devices Likewise Project Astoria is a universal tool for Android developers to immediately publish their native APK files to the Windows App Store Microsofts grand ambition is to have at least billion Windows devices within years Attracting people to buy new Windows phones and tablets is only possible if the most addictive mobile games from Android and iOS are available on the Windows App Store <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants more mobile apps and games so it can offset the declining revenue stream from Windows licensing The commission fees from the billionyear mobile games industry is partly why Apples NASDAQ AAPL Services division is now generating billion in quarterly sales The iOS app store is a monster cash generator because there are mobile gamers willing to buy virtual superheroes from Marvel Contest of Champions Unfortunately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Kings Candy Crush Saga is the only topgrossing iOS game that got ported to the Windows Phone platform The future economic benefits from Project Astoria and Project Underwood are easier to understand if we look at ThinkGamings chart below Apple gets a cut from these sixfigure estimated average daily sales of iPhone games in the United States Microsofts future revenue stream from mobile is a lot better if the other topgrossing games and apps from iOS also becomes available to Windows device owners Windows Phones weak market share in the world is largely due to the recalcitrant attitude of developers Consumers are flocking to buy Android phones instead of Windows Phones because the app ecosystem of Google NASDAQ GOOGL is a lot bigger than that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Google and its partners dont mind selling sub Android phones because selling virtual inapp items to gamers is very lucrative The hundreds of millions of people who downloaded Clash of Clans helped make that game a millionday monster cash generator as early as January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is clearly envious of Apple and Googles multibillion revenue from app store sales Like I mentioned above there are people who readily buy virtual mobile gaming items Mobile gamings estimated annual revenue is far higher than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gets from selling lowcost sub Lumia phones App developers like those people behind Clash of Clans and Game of War Fire Age continue to ignore the Windows Phone platform By introducing Project Astoria and Project Underwood <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might just persuade developers to port their billiondollar grossing games to the upcoming Windows platform The company needs a strong gamesdriven app store to replace the lost revenue from giving away free Windows OS licenses and upgrades Nadellas idea of letting Android and iOS game developers get friendlier with Windows is in line with my firm belief that mobile gaming could be the most compelling reason for people to buy cheap Windows devices Sure there are now thirdparty emulators that let people run Android apps on Windows computers and tablets However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt get a commission from the annual payment that gamers pay to get the Pro version of the BlueStacks Android emulator BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY tried to lure buyers by making BlackBerry OS install and run Android APKs But that trick did little to improve sales of BlackBerry OS handsets Buying inapp items inside BlueStacks is still processed through Google Plays store Unless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>buys BlueStacks or GenyMotion the company makes no money from thirdparty Android software emulators Nadellas approach of letting developers easily recompile their games for the Windows app store is smarter than John Chens virtual Android emulation trick I hope that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offers a lower commission fee say than the cut that Apple and Android charges developers for app store sales Source Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Wants More TopGrossing iOS And Android Apps On Windows Disclosure The author is long MSFT AAPL MoreThe author wrote
