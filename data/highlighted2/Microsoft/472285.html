datacenter industry It seems Intels server strategy is no longer working and the company needs to radically change the strategy In the second quarter of Intels NASDAQ INTC datacenter group DCG revenue came in at billion The companys DCG revenue is showing no signs of meaningful improvement despite its effort to create a diverse portfolio of server chips The datacenter industry however is witnessing strong growth driven by rising demand of cloudbased services As an Intel investor I feel this is a worrying sign for the companys datacenter business Although a significant erosion in DCG revenue isnt something that I expect I am now less bullish on Intels datacenter prospects than I was six months ago I believe Intels server strategy isnt working Intels Server Strategy Isnt Working Really Why At the end of first quarter of this year Intel launched its multisocket Xeon E v processor family based on BroadwellEP In June the company released its highend BroadwellEX Xeon processor range consisting of Xeon E v and E v processor families Intel also launched the Xeon E v processor family in June which is a variant of the Xeon E v productline with some scalability features of Xeon E v productline With the launch of Xeon E Intel has completed its Broadwell rollout Meanwhile a boom in the datacenter industry is going on driven by cloud adoption and data sovereignty According to a report Across the board revenue and growth is up both in the United States and globally A worldwide move toward cloud computing has data center dependencies up with no foreseeable end in sight Data center stocks surged in the first quarter of gaining an average of percent Amid this ongoing boom Intels DCG revenue hasnt scored encouraging performance in the last four quarters In contrast IBMs NYSE IBM revenues from its Systems Hardware segment appear to be slightly encouraging during the same period see the table below IBMs Systems hardware strategy with growing focus on LinuxONE mainframe and Linux on Power which is targeted at displacing x from the server market seems to be working In addition Googles NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG recent Power push is also working in favor of IBM Although these developments dont necessarily mean that the future prospect of the x architecture in the server market is becoming bleaker the stagnation in Intels DCG revenue certainly indicates that a slow but steady shift from the x space has already started to happen The fact is the vast majority of cloud computing and big data analytics workloads still run on x The moot question is why IBMs Linux push is helping Big Blue gain traction in the server market despite Chipzillas massive dominance Change in Industry Dynamics How Intel Should Respond With OpenPOWER slowly gathering steam enterprises have found a viable alternative to Intels Xeon E and E server chips IBMs strategy involves popularizing its Power architecturebased products via offering a compelling ecosystem consisting of both hardware and software with the help of OpenPOWER In contrast Intels strategy emphasizes on offering a wide range of general purpose processors with adding greater compute performance each time a new generation of a processor is introduced So far so good I believe But Intel has to face much tougher competition going forward Instead of making Power a general purpose processor IBM has made it ideal for cloudspecific workloads such as big data and analytics IBM has also made Power compatible with littleendian Linux the version of Linux which runs on x processors As a result migration from x to Power has become smoother for customers using Linux on x However I still believe Intels management has the flexibility to radically change its server strategy with the change in industry dynamics How Intel should respond to the OpenPOWERled changing industry dynamics Well I believe Intel should focus on making workloadspecific processors In addition Intel needs to make software an integral part of its ecosystem Intels decision to selloff its security division has sent a wrong message to its customers which is that the company is reluctant to build a softwareled ecosystem In contrast IBM is laying more emphasis on its security business than ever before with growing focus on cognitive security To learn more watch this video While making workloadspecific processors isnt difficult which is more of a marketing strategy and less of technological reform in nature building a softwareled ecosystem isnt something Intel is adept in doing However in order to remain relevant in todays continuously changing business environment Intel should embrace something that it never did before It should follow IBM and embrace change with growing focus on software For Intel the best way to achieve this is to eventually merge itself with a software giant like Oracle NYSE ORCL or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Alternatively purchasing a software company like VMware NYSE VMW could also do the trick Is Intels server dominance still intact We need to wait a year or so in order to know that If Intels recently introduced Xeons fail to boost its DCG revenue in the next four quarters we should concede that Intels server dominance is waning Disclosure I amwe are long INTC IBM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
