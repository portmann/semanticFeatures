</span>partnership is no longer exclusive This indicates that Yahoo has further flexibility to drive monetization design and functionality in search With this newfound freedom Yahoo will be betting everything on contextual search While this adds legs to the longterm investment thesis its not yet conclusive as to whether Yahoo has the necessary clout to drive engagement Heres some good news Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO now has added flexibility with its search algorithm and design The question what will Yahoo do with its newly found freedom Now Yahoo has blown the loophole wide open Under the renewal terms announced on Thursday Yahoos deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is no longer exclusive on desktop or mobile That means Yahoo could strike similar deals with other companies that own search engines like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Facebook NASDAQ FB or Amazon NASDAQ AMZN to also source their results within its search pages Deep down Im skeptical that Yahoo will enter into an agreement with another company Marissa Mayer while known as a dealmaker is more of a productoriented CEO which is the main reason why the board brought her onboard Her innate ability to create welldesigned webbased services that can fulfill some sort of niche without clogging the user experience with unnecessary junk is invaluable to Yahoo especially in its transformation of search Now remember early Yahoo was a juggernaut and Google was the challenger The main reason Yahoo lost to Google was because it was overly dependent on the directory listing approach versus the search engine In the early s Yahoo went ahead and used Googles search technologies and even listed Google as the primary search provider in its directory Pretty soon everyone heard about Google thanks to Yahoo Once Yahoo realized the value in search it went on an acquisition spree to try and shore up the lack of technical talent in search technology By then it was too late Google took off and Yahoo was left behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Yahoo needed to work together years ago if it wanted to create a legitimate product offering that can challenge Google Today a partnership isnt going to amount to much because the combined scale of advertising via the Yahoo Bing network didnt account for the rapid emergence of programmatic advertising which standardized adunits across social search and display platforms Programmatic ad buying can reach more than of the web and mobile viewing audience So competing technology rendered the Yahoo Bing alliance obsolete overnight So Yahoo isnt shopping for another deal because there arent anymore silver arrows that will somehow turn Yahoos search business into an overnight success Marissa knows this because she has extensive experience working with some of the very best data scientists and software engineers in the field So what other options does Marissa have at this point The creation of a contextual search algorithm would be both disruptive and may be useful enough to bring Internet users back to Yahoo Speaking at a Goldman Sachs technology conference in San Francisco Mayer said shes still excited about the possibility that search offers for the firm especially contextual search where ads appear on content pages Were long on search said Meyer during a QA session with a Goldman analyst Search is curiosity and that will never be done Assuming Yahoo is able to broaden its reach via search deals like the one with Mozilla while it overhauls its search algorithm for better queries Yahoo can gain back some users to its search platform Furthermore the development of a disruptive search technology could drive significant growth in MAUs which will trickle down to both CPMs and netrevenue after taking out traffic acquisition costs Admittedly Yahoo doesnt just have a market share problem Users have visited a search engine less frequently which indicates that engagement is trending downward This reduces the number of impressions that will be available for monetization even if it were to gain back market share What this also indicates is that Yahoo needs to develop a way to recreate some of that initial excitement Internet users had when they first came across search technologies Google is already working on this by developing search partnerships in which it can create deep links into mobile applications like Twitter NYSE TWTR This should buildout the amount of available content for search in general which may translate into more engagement Unfortunately Yahoo is still the laggard in terms of market share and it will take more than dealmaking to turn the search business around Investors should look very closely at the changes that Yahoo makes to its core search product and its ability to drive engagement for mobile apps These two factors will drive the valuation of the stock post spinoff of its Alibaba holdings unit While Im optimistic in Yahoos mobile business I would need to see further developments on the search side of the business before saying its one of the best investment ideas in the internet and media space
