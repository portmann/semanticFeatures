class='textDiv'>Dont Buy Procter Gamble Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Instead The Procter Gamble Company NYSEPG Seeking Alpha PG enjoys a tremendous reputation for its dividend Underneath the surface the companys dividend growth has slowed significantly in recent years as its sales and earnings have stagnated PG offers a nice yield but very weak dividend growth As a result dividend growth investors can do better Similarly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offers a nearly yield But unlike PG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has maintained very strong dividend growth in recent years thanks to its stronger fundamentals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>generates huge free cash flow which allows it to increase its dividend at much higher rates than PG Procter Gamble NYSE PG recently increased its dividend and thus extended its very long streak of annual dividend growth PG is a Dividend Aristocrat and has now come through with consecutive years of increased dividends To be sure PG has a long and very impressive dividend track record But whether its a good dividend stock to buy now is a much different question PG delivered just a dividend raise this year In my previous PG article I detailed my expectations for PGs dividend increase Suffice it to say PGs dividend increase was below even my modest expectations PG like many consumer staples stocks is having a hard time growing Revenue and profits are declining due to a brutal foreign exchange headwind But even after excluding currency there isnt much growth taking place At this point I dont see a compelling reason to buy PG The stock trades for a premium valuation while revenue and earnings arent growing PG offers a dividend yield which is decent enough but there are plenty of other stocks investors can buy for yields and much stronger future dividend growth I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is just such a stock PGs long history of dividend increases overshadows the fact that its dividend growth has slowed significantly in recent years In PG increased its dividend by Last year the increase was and its dividend growth fell again to this year The reason for this is because PG isnt growing Over the first two quarters of its current fiscal year net sales and earnings from continuing operations declined and respectively year over year In the first two quarters of its current fiscal year PG distributed of its quarterly free cash flow as a dividend With such low growth there isnt much room for stronger dividend increases Not only is PG struggling to grow but I believe its also overvalued The stock trades for times earnings a significant premium to the broader market The SP Index trades for times earnings PGs valuation is especially a concern because its sales and earnings growth is so weak making it extremely unlikely that the companys earnings will grow quickly enough to justify such an aboveaverage multiple In turn its weak earnings growth has resulted in weak dividend increases as well PGs bloated valuation and tiny dividend increases are red flags In comparison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trades for a much more reasonable times earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is cheaper than the SP and its much less aggressively valued than PG This is confusing since Microsofts fundamentals are in better shape Microsofts revenue grew last quarter despite an equally strong currency headwind Operating profit declined but by just Still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a cash machine In the first two quarters of its current fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>raked in billion of free cash flow It paid billion of dividends in this time In comparison to PG which is distributing twothirds of its free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>holds a more modest free cash flow payout ratio In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a bulletproof balance sheet Its one of only three US companies to hold a tripleA credit rating from Standard Poors Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet PGs dividend is about basis points higher than Microsofts right now but Microsofts stronger growth and cashstuffed balance sheet allow it to increase its dividend at much higher rates than PG Over the past five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grew its dividend by compounded annually This is more than double PGs dividend growth in the same period Take A Pass On PG Go For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Instead Im sitting on some spare cash in my IRA and Im looking for my next dividend stock to buy Among my list of requirements for investment I like to see at least a dividend yield a strong balance sheet and a highly profitable business that generates a lot of free cash flow PG briefly came across my radar because as I alluded to earlier its a legendary dividend stock But I soon realized investors can do better PG stock is overvalued its revenue and earnings are stagnating and its most recent dividend increase was a disappointment By contrast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>looks like a much better dividend stock The stock is much cheaper on a valuation basis and will grow its dividend much faster As a result I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has much more to offer than PG for dividend growth investors Source Dont Buy
