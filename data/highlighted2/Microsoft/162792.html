<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a stock is probably best known for its high valuation during the dotcom bubble and the subsequent decline in the share price Yet this notion of share price moving out of step with business performance is not constrained to a single time period This article demonstrates the extreme ebb and flow pricing history of the company as it relates to business performance In a previous article I used the JM Smucker Company NYSE SJM as an illustration of a company that exhibited the ebb and flow of share prices quite well That is the security demonstrated the reality that share prices tend to bounce about quite a bit while the business performance is apt to be much steadier Eventually things more or less work out in the long term but in the interim you can see a large disconnect between price and value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is an even more extreme example of this ebb and flow concept Lets work through various periods to demonstrate what I mean From through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was able to increase its earningspershare by to per year During the same time the share price rocketed up by nearly per year resulting in the now infamous dotcom bubble valuation Its not that the company wasnt showing exceptional growth potential and improvement it certainly was Instead it was merely the fact that investors were willing to pay an even higher valuation The market bids share price far outgrew the wonderful performance of the business Naturally this once euphoric time led to future disappointment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was not able to keep up its immense growth rate Yet thats not to suggest that it didnt grow at all From fiscal year through fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grew earnings per share by an average compound rate of per year Respectable for most companies but not nearly enough to support times earnings As a result the share price declined quite a bit It went from over to under at year end resulting in an annual decline of nearly This is the sort of thing thats important to watch out for Some might classify this is dead money but I would contend that this doesnt capture the essence of the story very well The company was still cruising along turning in annual growth The problem was valuation Moving from to a further story can be told Heres a look at the companys metrics during that period As you can see its more or less an up and down story Nine percent annual revenue growth turned into just total earnings growth due to margin compression Then the company was able to meaningfully reduce its share count such that earnings per share grew by per year Finally the stock saw PE compression over the period resulting in share price growth of about per year If you add in dividends you come to a collective total return of per year Overall this looks reasonable you had a company growing in the midtohigh single digits and your investment returns would have been in this range Yet this period also can be divided into two different time periods At the end of fiscal year shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>were trading hands around The earnings per share were a bit over resulting in a PE ratio in the to range At the end of fiscal year the company was earning nearly per share or a growth rate of about per year As a result of this strong growth you might suspect that the share price would grow quite robustly as well Yet this wasnt the case Six years later with earnings more than twice as high the share price was just As an investor you had to watch patiently as the business continued to generate more and more profits resulting in a larger and larger earnings claim while the share price effectively stagnated The earnings multiple went from above to under Thats the sort of ebb and flow nature thats hard to deal with psychologically People like instant results Waiting years and years with an improving business but a stagnant stock price is a true test For those who believe in the company it could indeed be a buying opportunity For those who are more skeptical or take their cues from price action it could be a reason to sell a security that just keeps getting cheaper Then a funny thing happened From through Microsofts earnings went down slightly both in a per share sense and on a companywide basis When you see something like that you might suspect that the share price would follow suit Yet this didnt occur Instead the share price went from up to a climb in the face of stagnating actually declining earnings Business performance and share price performance especially in the short to mediumterm can be too drastically different things This is what extreme ebbs and flows look like Note that adjusted earnings and fiscal yearends were used Over the very long time frame you might suspect that the share price more or less catches up or falls back in line with business performance but it can certainly over and under shoot A lot of stuff happens in between You had a period of exceptional earnings growth with even more impressive share price increases Then you had a sixyear stretch where earnings grew nicely but the share price collapsed mightily This was followed by a second sixyear stretch where earnings grew at a very solid rate yet the share price hardly budged Finally coincidentally once the growth began to stagnant the share price shot up Its not a linear process Eventually it will work out but you cant anticipate for it to occur on your schedule or even on cue with business performance Moreover this doesnt just apply to the dotcom bubble More recently just because a security returned an average of per year over a decade this doesnt mean it happened each and every month period As illustrated above this was quite far from reality The business has been rather consistent but the share price moves in fits and starts Recognizing these types of situations can better enable you to think about partnership decisions as you move through the investing
