Seeking Alpha Satya Nadellas vision of building a comprehensive ecosystem continues to thrive The writedown and layoffs preserve resources Contrary to popular belief the phone division is not dead Today I came across a bearish article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT by SA contributor Adam Hartung Like many other bears he views the recent B writeoff and continued layoffs as a sign of incompetence from new CEO Satya Nadella The article goes on to mention how Microsofts products such as the Surface Pro and Windows OS have failed to gain traction and boost profitability for the company Unlike he I do not profess to be an exper or to have made any prescient predictions on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the past However I do take issue with the flaws in his reasoning and evidence that does not hold up under scrutiny Plainly put it should be obvious to investors who have done sufficient due diligence that this piece of seemingly negative news is actually a great positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the long run First despite heavily criticizing the Nokia acquisition as a catastrophic mistake Mr Hartung implies that Nadellas move away from Nokia is a negative for the company Herein lies the contradiction Like his peer CEOs who take on the new role he has slashed and burned employment shut down at least one big business taken massive writeoffs Yet he still has not put forward a strategy that should encourage investors employees customers or suppliers that the company will remain relevant long term Amidst all these big tactical actions it is completely unclear what the strategy is to remain a viable company as customers move quickly and in droves to mobile devices using competitive products By taking the writeoff on Nokia and streamlining the company through headcount reduction Nadellas vision is to make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a leaner more competitive company in areas which they can outcompete their peers In fact in his email to employees he details plans to focus on segments where they are able to leverage existing competitive advantages We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software In effect the bears stance that Nadella has no vision is utterly false Since taking the helm he has taken painful but necessary steps to improve Microsofts position in relation to their peers taking a practical and honest approach The Nokia writedown and layoffs are simply a sign that the company is taking a different approach to mobile while still remaining committed to the phone division Moving on bears like Mr Hartung correctly point out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had failed in the past to create a thriving developer community like the ones attached to Android and iOS thus failing to create an ecosystem to lure customers However they completely omit or discount new initiatives under the new leadership to improve in this area Of these initiatives the most significant are Project Westminster Astoria Islandwood and Centennial four bridges which aim to help developers port their apps from Android and iOS to Windows This is a smart move that essentially leverages the deep base of existing Android and iOS apps and converts them over to boost the Windows ecosystem Some might argue that this indicates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is playing catchup in the mobile sphere and I would agree wholeheartedly However we also need to give Nadella and his team credit for engineering a comeback Theyve figured out how to make it easy and quick for developers to convert their apps for Windows Couple that with the expanded base of Windows users due to the free giveaway and theyve created a strong incentive for developers to engage in the Windows ecosystem Furthermore while bears would claim that the Windows giveaway destroys profitability they are completely missing the point This move allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to transition Windows and users onto a single platform quickly and painlessly which creates technical synergies when adding new features and apps It is far more efficient to work on improving a single platform than apps compatible with multiple versions of Windows Microsofts monetization will come when they have acquired and engaged more users from these improvements As an example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is trying to grow Bing by improving aesthetic and useful features such as Bing Maps Once the user base expands they will be able to increase revenue from search advertising and other venues Hence this strategy requires time and significant RD but is likely to pay off in the long run In fact Bings market share in search continues to increase and has reached recently This strategy can be generalized to other products and offerings essentially encompassing the entire turnaround effort In a way bears have a point here on how Microsofts bottom line is still stagnating However we need to realize that ventures and turnarounds such as these take some time to materialize into endgame profits especially when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is trying to innovate after falling behind for years Anyone who has knowledge of the mobile sphere knows that Microsofts weakness lies in its shallow ecosystem However in terms of hardware and design Microsofts offerings such as the Nokia Lumia product line are perceived as high quality see here here here and here Specifically its strengths are the display camera quality distinctive and aesthetic design as well as its highly customizable UI In essence there are still people who love their Windows phones and if Nadellas plan of improving the Windows ecosystem and OS is executed well we could see a resurgence of Windows phones Management recognizes that continuing to compete heads up against Samsung OTC SSNLF and Apple NASDAQ AAPL would be costly and ineffective and has instead chosen to focus on expanding the breadth and depth of its ecosystem which will benefit all Windows devices Obviously we should not get our hopes up as they face stiff competition from Apple and Samsung However they would be able to do much more with less even with the reduced headcount resources This is because they are able to focus on a single version of the OS and bring new features and apps to all its devices including phones I believe this is what Mr Nadella meant when he said Our reinvention will be centered on creating mobility of experiences across the entire device family including phones Hence unlike what bears like Mr Hartung would like you to believe the Windows phone is not yet dead in fact a thriving ecosystem and quality hardware could give the product new vitality Often looking at the past is not a good indicator of whats to come especially if theres a major change in how the company fundamentally operates In this case Satya Nadella is revolutionizing Windows by moving away from the reliance on Windows legacy and licensing fees carving out new revenue streams from forwardlooking
