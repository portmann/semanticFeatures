NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha LG Electronics and Sony join Samsung Dell and Pegatron as Microsofts major partners who will preinstall Office Skype and OneDrive apps on Android devices There are now Android device manufacturers who are helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>increase the total number of users of its mobile apps The offer of lower Android licensing fees is definitely helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT attract more original equipment manufacturers to preinstall Office Skype OneDrive and OneNote mobile apps on Android products In addition to the initial partners which includes Samsung OTCSSNLF Dell and Pegatron Android devices last March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced that more manufacturers will also preinstall its mobile apps on Android tablets LG Electronics OTCLGEAF and Sony NYSE SNE are among the new OEMs backing Nadellas crossplatform strategy to increase the number of users of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>mobile apps The list also includes topselling popular Chinese Android vendors Teclast and Cube Samsung LG Dell and Sony are taking advantage of the discounted Android royalty licensing offer from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Android device manufacturers allegedly pay to per device as royalty fees over Microsofts Androidrelated patents Theres substantial benefit to Samsung because preinstalling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>mobile apps might help save to my own estimate on each Samsung Android device Samsung shipped out million smartphones last year If it can save or on every Android handset Samsung could save as much as million annually LG is also a major phone vendor that could save a lot of money by preinstalling Office and Skype on its Android phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could recover the lost money over the Android licensing discounts through mobile advertisements and premium subscriptions of Office from Android device users Android remains the dominant OS in mobile devices IDC says Android has s share in smartphones Windows Phone still has less than share Compelling Android OEMs to preinstall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apps is therefore an easy to way to increase the potential number of people who will pay for Office subscriptions The more Android device users who get access to Skype the better it is for Microsofts mobile advertising efforts The reason why Google NASDAQ GOOGL leads the global mobile advertising business is due to the billionplus number of Android devices being used around the globe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is not among the top ten players in mobile ads most probably because of the low market share of Windows phones Preinstalling Skype on new Android tablets and smartphones could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>benefit more from the billion mobile ad spending that will happen next year Android enjoys a bigger presence than Windows mobile gadgets in the US and China These two countries are the top markets for mobile advertisements Persuading Cube Haier and Teclast to preinstall Skype on Android tabletsphones gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a better access to Chinas billion mobile advertising industry Preinstalling Skype Translator on Android device users might also make it more useful to Chinese people than the Google Translate app Unlike Google Translate Skype Translator can do realtime English to Mandarin Chinese and viceversa voice translation Samsung LG Sony and Dell could offer cheaper Android devices or improve their gross margins thanks to the discounted licensing fees from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The cutthroat pricing on some Android phones makes it difficult for manufacturers to make a decent margin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could persuade more OEMs to preinstall its apps on Android devices if it implements a revenue sharing deal Google still does not practice any revenue sharing on Android European wireless carriers are already threatening a ban on Googles mobile ads allegedly to force the internet search giant to share
