receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Negativity surrounding Apple will lift after it reports earnings later this month Tim Cook is a better CEO than Steve Jobs Mark Hibben is among Seeking Alphas top Long Ideas and Technology contributors No in both categories as of this writing He is an independent iOS developer who writes broadly about tech on SA with a consistent focus on Apple NASDAQ AAPL In this outlook article we play the hits Given the response we see at Seeking Alpha its clear readers want to hear about Apple And they want to hear about the company from Hibben So with zero interruption from me SA Editor Rocco Pendola heres what we at Seeking Alpha like to call some strong opinion analysis OA exclusively from Hibben The most important thing investors need to do in is take a longterm view of Apples stock price performance relative to the overall growth of the company Ive pointed out that Apples price has lagged its growth considerably this year Despite remarkable growth in its fiscal yy revenue up yy operating income up investors havent rewarded Apple with commensurate share price gains as the chart below shows Its been claimed that this is because the market is efficient in pricing Apple for its future growth This is absolute nonsense Market efficiency seems to be a concept that people like to assert when it supports their viewpoint Was the market efficient in pricing Enron or GTAT If the market is efficient at all its only in the very long term because it takes a long time for the market to figure out what a company is really worth Eventually the market figured out that Enron and GTAT were worthless Eventually the market will figure out that Netflix NASDAQ NFLX isnt worth anything close to what its PE implies Eventually the market will figure out that Apple is worth a lot more than what its PE implies I expect that a lot of the negativity about Apple that has been holding the price down will let up after the December quarter earnings report later this month Tim Cook Is A Better CEO Than Steve Jobs The management styles of Cook and Jobs are very different Jobs was much more involved with product design taking a direct hand in UI design as well as physical design Jobs is on a lot of Apple patents as a result including basic UI patents for iOS Its also well known that it was Jobs that insisted that the first iPhone have a glass rather than plastic screen in order to minimize scratches There was a downside to the Jobs management approach This was its insistence on building the best product which meant best as Jobs saw it This was held over for years even after Cook took over in the form of the insistence that the iPhone screen was the best size This caused Apple to fall behind the market Cook is more pragmatic and that is reflected in a more marketdriven approach to product design The iPhone and s are the products of this more pragmatic approach Cook has also moved to diversify the iPhone and iPad product lines rather than just building the best product for each What is best is really in the eye of the beholder and technology companies necessarily need to address a broad spectrum of what the market views as best in order to be successful Thus we now have two screen sizes for iPhone three for iPad and possibly another screen size on the way for iPhone In the sense that Cook is more pragmatic Apple has become a much more successful company for it For this reason Cook has been a huge benefit for Apple investors Cook is not the visionary that Jobs was but hes a better CEO His recent management changes give me even more confidence in his abilities Hes delegating much more and much better than Jobs ever did Clearly the role of design visionary has been delegated to Jonathan Ive His elevation of Jeff Williams to COO shows that he is able to let go of his old role to embrace a more top level management role Im particularly happy with the elevation of Johny Srouji to SVP for Hardware Technologies This demonstrates a recognition of the critical role that Apples custom system on chip design plays in creating an essential discriminator for Apples iOS devices Srouji has led the design team for all of Apples SOCs since the A in the first iPad Why Did Apples Attempts To Develop A Streaming TV Package Fail Probably the situation is very different from what it was when iTunes first came out in Content downloads for sale was relatively new and Apple could offer a unique experience in iTunes as a digital content store The expertise required to build iTunes and get it to work reliably wasnt as widely available It made more sense for the music industry to throw in with Apple than to try to build an equivalent capability on its own That isnt true for the TV and cable networks now The large networks have invested in Hulu and cable networks such as HBO NYSE TWX have their own iOS and Android apps Whats the added value that Apple could provide If there is any its in making iTunes the best onestop shop for content whether streamed purchased or rented But I dont think that gave Apple a lot of leverage with the content providers And it may be that Apple TV and iOS and Mac OS X devices are just hosts for a variety of contentbased apps rather than iTunes being the center of everything I think the rumors of Apple trying to put together a skinny bundle of TV channels for live streaming are credible but it may never happen Probably the networks will simply go it alone with their own apps for OTT And of course this would save Apple a lot of money Back when the Beats deal was still a rumor but the video with Dr Dre had been posted on YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL appearing to confirm the deal I wrote an article Why The AppleBeats Deal May Be Dead Although my speculation was wrong the article resonated with quite a few readers I received quite a few comments to the effect that Apple would be better off if the deal was dead Its actually very difficult for anyone outside of Apple to assess the value of Beats to Apple as I said at the time It doesnt appear to have been revenue per se I continue to believe that Beats had some music curation technology software that Apple wanted This has been subsequently confirmed more or less by the appearance of Apple Music When I think about the problem of providing individualized humancurated song lists for millions of subscribers I tend to conclude that there must be a significant level of software augmentation in order to make it work Otherwise I dont think its cost effective The key elements of the software are feedback to tell the curator how well the curator is doing in engaging subscribers and some form of classification of subscribers by taste and listening preferences Its actually a very difficult problem Im continually appalled at how lousy the suggestions are in purely softwarebased systems such as Netflix Netflix recommendations are a great example of artificial stupidity which is much more common than true artificial intelligence The realization that a music service needed human curation combined with some form of software augmentation was probably what made the Beats deal work This probably extends to other forms of digital content like movies and TV So I think the jury is still out on the Beats acquisition But if Apple Music continues to grow and if the tech is applicable to other areas that Apple might get into such as streaming video then it will have been worth the Beats price tag As for a large MA in general Im sure that this is something that would excite investors but I doubt that its in the cards Apple could get huge but I doubt that it would be good for the company Growing organically allows the company to manage the growth much more effectively Googles acquisition of Motorola and Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT acquisition of Nokias NYSE NOK smartphone business serve as better cautionary examples than Beats I expect that Apple will continue to pursue its policy of acquiring small companies for technology and talent As for Dr Dre and Iovine well acquihires dont normally make it into the SVP ranks that report directly to Cook I believe both are working under Eddie Cue Competition Between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>And Apple People tend to assume that I must be hostile to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>because Im an Apple investor and write so frequently about Apple In fact I own several Windows PCs running either Win or Win and do most of my work on them Win overall is my favorite OS I have a great deal of admiration for Satya Nadella but I dont regard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a good investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is very much in transition and the transition is not going as well as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors seem to think The lack of presence in smartphones is a huge problem that cannot be discounted so easily Smartphones and mobile devices in general have become the most important personal computers for most people Its the computing device they use the most The fact that Microsofts efforts in this arena have collapsed very expensively is an enormous problem Microsofts consumer devices such as Surface Pro and Surface Book have to be viewed in this larger context because to pretend that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt need to succeed in smartphones would be ludicrous I like the Surface Pro and Surface Book In fact Ive said often that Apples stance on not equipping Mac OS X laptops with touchscreens is just plain dumb Once again this seems to be a holdover from the Jobs era Once again Apple is claiming to know whats best for consumers rather than offering a choice Ive seen a number of articles by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bulls proclaiming that Microsofts Surface products will take share away from iPad Unfortunately I cant argue against this However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has only a limited ability to capitalize on this Microsofts fundamental problem is that its competing against similar products from its Windows OEMs When a new Surface Pro is introduced it gooses sales for that quarter to about billion The new Surface Book may double that but its still a fraction of what Apple sells in iPads alone But a larger fraction As far as Windows devices in general I continue to maintain that the free upgrade being offered to Win will have a net effect of depressing Windows device sales for Things may look up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can subsist for a while by appealing to existing Windows users to upgrade to new ultra mobile form factors running Win However Im starting to doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will ever achieve its goal of billion Win users If we look at usage statistics from sites like Netmarketshare it appears that theres a very large block of Win users who arent interested in upgrading Im personally a little uncomfortable with the role of investment adviser I prefer to offer insight into technology companies and let investors make up their own minds Lately partly under encouragement from SA Ive started to offer BuyHoldSell ratings That being said I dont want to commit to owning any particular stocks at any time in or the future I will reiterate my Buy ratings for Apple Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA TSMC NYSE TSM and ARM NASDAQ ARMH I regard Intel NASDAQ INTC Architecture as rapidly becoming obsolete so I recommend Intel and AMD NASDAQ AMD as Sells Im interested in and may upgrade my Hold ratings for Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM as events unfold next year As for what I currently am invested in Im allin on Apple This is primarily because I believe that the negative narrative that has kept the stock down this past year will likely let up when Apple reports December quarter earnings If the market still wont reward Apple following the earnings report I wont pull money out of Apple since I still think it will win in the long term But I probably will start putting money into other stocks including any of the ones listed as Buys or Holds Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
