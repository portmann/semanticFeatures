style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but not willing to buy here Selling puts could be right for you Our recent articles combining fundamental analysis and options have been well received by Seeking Alpha readers The most rewarding aspect of writing here is when a reader genuinely appreciates that heshe learned something new from an article Weve had many such comments on this options series Our portfolio consists of dividend growth stocks mainly ranging from the usual suspects such as Altria Group NYSE MO to slightly less conventional ones like Omega Healthcare NYSE OHI The only technologyrelated stock we own is Apple NASDAQ AAPL and weve been on the lookout for the second one for a long time Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM held that position for a while but we sold it off thankfully before its recent troubles began That still leaves us with just one technology related stock Cisco NASDAQ CSCO is one of the frontrunners but we arent convinced about its future yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is another candidate for its clout as well as cloud This article focuses on MSFT an option chain we like and its prospects You are taking a bullish position on the stock contrary to the misconception that when you do anything with puts you are being bearish You get a premium in your account right away for the obligation to buy the stock at the price you want on the date you want So you decide the date and the price you want to buy and the party you sell the option contract to pays you for it But you are taking a risk in that if the stock drops well below your strike price you still have to buy the stock at the price you chose not the current market price You believe a stock will not drop below a certain level and if it does you want to be a buyer An Example Below is Microsofts option chain which expires on Jan Lets pick the put for example For selling one contract one contract shares you need to have a cash balance of in your account per share times shares in a contract to cover the possible purchase of shares of MSFT Please note there are two variations here Some brokers allow using the premium from the sale to be used as part of this trade For example if a trade needs to be set aside but nets you a premium of the broker might allow you to sell the put with Some brokers allow some investors to go on margin Margin is essentially borrowing money from the broker and we do not advice the average investor to do this The risk of being margincalled isnt worth the reward for most investors The premium on this particular put is likely to be between and per contract depending on the day That would net you a premium of say for one contract <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is well above at the time of expiration Your option expires worthless and you net nearly for about months of your willingness to set aside on this contract Remember your is not locked up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>beyond this point This trade gives you double the yield than you currently get on Microsofts shares Risk If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really rockets up from here your option returns will be lower than the stock returns This may happen but given this stocks history it has a habit of being range bound for an extended period of time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is at or below you are obligated to buy shares at Remember you already netted per share when you sold the put So your cost basis is essentially As long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is above this you will have a net positive return when this option chain expires Risk The risk in this scenario is that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really tanks in the next months and trades below you will still have to buy your shares at With the stock trading at as of this writing would represent fall in price That looks unlikely as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is fast becoming a respected dividend stock and investorsfunds are likely to scoop in on bargains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been delivering dividend increases since and is very likely to announce one more in September If it increases the dividend by the new annual dividend will be around per share The strike price would represent a yield for investors As a comparison the maximum yield over the last five years was Based on the EPS estimate of a purchase at would represent a multiple of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has not traded at or below that level since Satya Nadella took over the reins Its not a given that the stock is never going to trade at this multiple but when your CEO is as hated as Steve Ballmer was the successor is likely to get the benefit of the doubt for an extended period of time After being neutral on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for a long time we are now beginning to like the company and stock This is not because of any recent share price movement or its strong dividends Its simply because of its cloud platform Azure Weve personally witnessed a few midsized companies moving away from Amazons AWS NASDAQ AMZN to Microsofts Azure for two main reasons pricing and development platform AWS does not allow integration services programming tools and frameworks on it Its simply a hostingstaging platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>with its rich programming heritage handles this very well To put this in simple terms imagine you build a software for your customer in your development office but host it on Amazons AWS Your client requests a change in the software AWS will not allow you to do this programming change on its platform The software programmers have to do this at their end and move the changes to AWS Microsofts Azure on the other hand allows this seamlessly This may seem like a minor thing for the average onlooker but for the million of companies that work on critical production support this is key as it saves time and money In addition Azure is natively compatible with some of the most common technologies used by many businesses Why Because those common technologies are provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to begin with Let us not forget Microsofts strong presence in the public sector The private sector is very well exposed to the cloud but the public sector is just about beginning to catch up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>already provides plenty of enterprise solutions to these public agencies think county offices state agencies and federal agencies and when they make a move to the cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will likely be their choice given the familiarity Forget about the growth prospects for a minute Microsofts existing business is so strong that its lowest free cash flow level in the last five years December is sufficient to meet its current dividend requirements Granted a company has much more to pay than just dividends but whenever we see this trend it clearly shows two things the company isnt cyclical and it has reliable strong and continuous inflow of money These are two key components that we look for as dividend growth investors We did like Ciscos recent earnings report and its plan to return more capital to shareholders But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now the frontrunner to be the second technology related stock in our portfolio We might buy the shares outright in the near future but are also watching the options chain to sell puts on down days to collect some nice premium and the option to buy at a price we like I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Technology
