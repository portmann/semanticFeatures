explained and what it means for Oracle Oracle NYSE ORCL reported Q earnings on March You can read the Seeking Alpha transcript here Its no secret that Oracle has been focused on transitioning from being reliant on traditional onpremise hardware and software sales and moving to public Cloud revenue This topic has been well covered but I have a solid understanding of this space and want to offer a perspective I think others have missed If we look at Oracles Fortune customer base the large majority own or lease all the equipment that makes up their IT systems and place them in specially designed rooms called data centers These data centers are owned or leased and managed by each individual company at a their own expense The hardware and software needed to deliver an Oracle application or web page is comprised of seven layers as pictured below The picture shows the entire Oracle stack but a typical organization utilizing the traditional onpremise model will buy each of these layers from more than one supplier The hardware servers and storage will come from companies such as HP NYSE HPQ NYSE HPE Dell Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and EMC The leader in the virtual machine layer is VMWare NYSE VMW with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT being the second largest player The operating system will typically come from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Redhat NYSE RHT the database from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>IBM NYSE IBM or Oracle and the middlewareapplications from SAP NYSE SAP Oracle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and many others There are a few different options for cloud private public and hybrid Cloud Private is where the customer retains ownership of the entire stack very similar to the traditional onpremise model Public is where the service provider owns and sells the stack as a service and hybrid is a mix of both I focus on public Cloud for this article as its the focus for companies like Oracle Oracle has three different public Cloud offerings Infrastructure as a Service IaaS Platform as a Service Paas and Software as a Service SaaS Each offering provides a different number of the above pictured layers in the stack IaaS it typically the bottom four PaaS adds onto IaaS by including the database SaaS includes all seven layers or collections of all seven layers that are needed to make up a full system Salesforcecom NYSE CRM and ServiceNow NYSE NOW are examples of companies that sell their application services using the SaaS model Amazon Web Services AWSNASDAQ AMZN is an example of a very successful provider of IaaS and PaaS In the traditional model each layer could be provided by a different vendor There is considerable competition for dollars in each layer The nature of these types of systems is that once a software stack selection is made it can be very expensive to change The cloud model is advantageous to companies such as Oracle because they can capture all the dollars that go into the entire stack not just one or two pieces It can be costly for an organization to migrate an application and its data to the cloud but more importantly for Oracle its becomes difficult to move away You have a situation where Oracle can capture much more of the customer spend and then make it much more difficult for their competition to obtain that spend in the future Having a captive customer base can help maintain margin and incentivize customers to improve synergies by moving more and more to the public Cloud service The numbers are mixed and the challenges are many While everyone agrees that public Cloud adoption is growing its not clear how much of the growth is real or window dressing by the public Cloud providers There are a number of advantages for smaller customers or new system builds but we have yet to see how many customers are truly migrating their large workloads to the Cloud What to watch out for when reviewing the numbers As most readers are likely aware public Cloud revenue is based on a subscription model rather than an upfront large capital purchase followed by annually recurring percentage charges Oracle and others have discussed these difference in their earnings calls and have explained why this has lead to temporary drops in traditional licensing revenue The big issue comes in understanding what a particular company is booking as public Cloud revenue and what is booked as traditional onpremise revenue Companies such as Amazon IBM Oracle and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would like to show investors as much public Cloud revenue as possible Growing public Cloud revenue shows that the company is making the transition to the new realities of the market and signals to investors that they can participate in the expected growing public Cloud market To avoid targeting any one of these companies and how they operate Ill provide an example of the type of thing you need to watch out for using a fictional story Imagine you are the salesperson for a company that sells music on CDs Your customers demand and love the flexibility CDs provide that they own them can lend them and completely control how they are played They loved owning their own CD player and the comfort and security that provides as music is a critical part of their life Your boss tells you that you will only now get commission on sales of digital music thats delivered through the internet You try for a while but have trouble convincing more than a few customers to buy the new option other than CDs In the meantime your competitor is making significant inroads selling digital music You come to find out that instead of selling a CD for your competitor is selling the digital copy for and throwing in a free CD copy of the same music If you were in this same position can you think of other ways you can drive more digital music sales with minimal real demand You can see that it may look like public Cloud revenue is growing but the customers may not actually be utilizing it If they are not utilizing the Cloud you dont get all the business benefits described above If companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Oracle are truly making huge inroads in enticing companies away from onpremise offerings it will impact VMwares earnings VMware is the undisputed number one provider of the virtualization layer and is not offered as part of either the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Oracle Cloud offerings Going forward if we see the cloud numbers from Oracle and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>growing rapidly but dont see some kind of flattening or decline with VMware and we havent so far Id suggest that means something is not quite adding up If you are interested in investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Oracle based on their booming cloud businesses you might want to weigh the risk that their public Cloud revenue may actually be customers that are entitled to use the cloud but are not actually taking advantage of it In this case most of the advantages to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Oracle are not being realized
