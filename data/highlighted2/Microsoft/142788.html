more appealing Apples iPad Pro is a likely flagship for the first D XPoint product FUD is the fear uncertainty and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products I learned of FUD nearly years ago but I didnt realize the scope of its use until my article on Zillow While I was very positive on Zillow NASDAQ Z the entire world suddenly turned negative on it Analysts and the media painted a picture of fear uncertainty and doubt The impact on its share price was heartbreaking I had made an extremely bullish call on Zillow at its high of As a good chunk of the analysts and media turned bearish over the next couple of months the stock plummeted after they barely beat their quarter The stock was eventually cut in half from where I called it I really felt like an idiot But then the ownership list changed dramatically and the skies suddenly turned blue analysts and the media all started to paint a rosy picture And then stock marched to as high as The news certainly isnt universally negative rather than participate some outlets just simply ignored it altogether But theres enough of it to lend some credence that the stock is currently priced appropriately The folks at Barrons for example already have insider information as to the tremendous upside in Micron But now theyre bearish all of a sudden Funny how that happens If Micron were IPOed today with just XPoint HMC and Automata it would command a much higher market cap than where it is now I refuse to believe that the recent negativity is the result of ignorance I think that theres something more going on here If the latter is true then Micron shareholders should know that they are likely better off turning down all offers until at least because it is quite apparent that few people can fathom the impact of XPoint Allow me to go ahead and recap this impact XPoint production rights are owned by IMFT Micron has the right to buy out Intels percent IMFT share beginning in XPoint will displace most DRAM needs some NAND in the shortterm While XPoint will be cheaper than DRAM bit sales will increase disproportionally eg the average PC currently ships with between and Gbytes of RAM but the smallest XPoint chip is Gbytes so people wont have a choice Premium products will migrate to homogeneous cached XPoint displacing NAND Intel and Micron dont need to create demand the product itself does this by increasing performance and power efficiency by several orders of magnitude Rewriting the operating system is not required to take advantage of XPoint as the benefits can be implemented transparently at a hardware level You can put this in yesterdays systems and capture most of the benefits immediately Only small changes are required for full benefit Micron owns the transistorless Ovonic Threshold Switch IP which is a substantial advantage vs the competition Micron will become the ARM NASDAQ ARMH of phase change memory already having royaltybearing agreements in place with Samsung OTCSSNLF and Hynix OTCHXSCF through their Ovonyx subsidiary The ability to instantaneously switch operating systems Intel NASDAQ INTC patent is another benefit of having nonvolatile system memory When I initially predicted XPoint back in June I described this whole ordeal as a Paul Otellini work And Paul Otellini was very fond of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and had played a major role in their conversion to Intel on the Mac line Currently Apples tablet business is getting crushed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Thats because iOS is a toy compared to a real operating system like Windows or OSX As a former Microsofthater I didnt believe this until I took a stroll through the library at the local university most of the students were using Surface product Apple is holding the iPad Pro very closely It would not surprise me that this is a result of its groundbreaking nature If it includes XPoint and an Intel processor then it will have the trivial capability to switch between iOS OSX and Windows instantaneously And Apples customer base seemingly prefers paying substantial premiums Editors Note This
