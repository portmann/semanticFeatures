no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock has been on a nearly unimpeded rally over the past two years and has beaten the SP by a wide margin But in this time Microsofts earnings havent grown much at all Earnings growth is weighed down by declining margins the strong US dollar and slowing emerging market growth At times forward earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock is valued at levels not seen in years As hard as this is to say I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is overvalued right now Tech giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has traditionally been one of the cheapest blue chip tech stocks For many years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was dogged for its overreliance on the personal computer and this pervasive bearishness kept its valuation multiples at low levels frequently in the low doubledigits That is until recently Thanks to the advancements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has made in growth areas like the cloud investors have rewarded the stock with a lofty valuation multiple After a prolonged period of trading in a relatively tight range <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock is up in the past year while the SP is down in the same time Investors have recently become very enthusiastic about the future growth possibilities but the reality is that Microsofts earnings growth hasnt kept up with rising expectations The result is that at this point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trades for a higher valuation than it has at any point in the past five years I wrote about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>several times in the past year including this article in April and this article in July in which I advised investors to buy the stock because of how cheap it was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has performed strongly since those recommendations Now that the stock is at its no longer cheap I believe buying at this level will set up investors for only mediocre annualized returns going forward I cant believe Im saying this but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>appears overvalued To be sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is no longer the same company that traded for a forward PE It has made demonstrable progress in breaking away from the PC and has made huge inroads into highergrowth areas Due to the success of cloudbased platforms like Office and Azure Microsofts commercial cloud revenue soared in the fourth quarter of fiscal and has now exceeded an billion annual run rate Microsofts revenue growth in recent years has been impressive the company grew revenue by in fiscal and by in fiscal The problem is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has had to spend increasing amounts of money to obtain this revenue growth This has weighed on Microsofts margins and the result has been weak almost nonexistent earnings growth Even when excluding the billions in impairment charges taken against GAAP earnings in the past few years Microsofts adjusted nonGAAP earnings have flatlined For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>earned per share in per share in and per share in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hasnt gotten off to the best start in fiscal either Revenue declined while earnings grew just in the first quarter year over year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is getting hit by many of the same headwinds that are causing other tech stocks to plummet namely the strengthening US dollar and slowing economic growth in emerging markets like China But while most other tech stocks are declining to reflect these challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shares keep rallying That should be a concern to investors buying at these levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has beaten the SP by percentage points in the past two years despite virtually no earnings growth in that time That has elevated Microsofts valuation to levels not seen in years At times forward earnings expectations are simply too high The other adverse effect of Microsofts bloated valuation is that it has lowered the dividend yield to In other words investors arent getting a very good buying opportunity at this price either from a value or income perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Good Company NotSoGood Stock What made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>such a compelling buy in my previous articles its dirtcheap valuation and dividend yield are no longer there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>remains a highly profitable company But there are many cases in which a strong company can amount to a poor investment if too high a price is paid for its future earnings growth The great thing about buying great companies when theyre cheap is that the future expectations are so low that the company doesnt have to get everything right in order for investors to earn decent returns Thats why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock was a much better buy when I wrote about it in previous articles Expectations were very low and the dividend yield was much higher which meant the future return potential was greater However the flip side of this dynamic is also true <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now has higher expectations than at any point in the past five years At times forward earnings I believe the stock doesnt offer much of a margin of safety As a result Id wait for a decent pullback of at least to a forward PE multiple in the midteens before jumping in Disclaimer This article represents the opinion of the author who is not a licensed financial advisor This article is
