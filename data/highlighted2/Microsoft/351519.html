and other financial sites across the internet housing prices continue to rise globally with no end in sight Aided by low interest ratesincreases in Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Dear Tim Cook the DoJ and FBI will no longer require your assistance in unlocking the iPhone of Syed Farook who along with his wife Tashfeen Malik murdered more than a dozen people at an employee holiday party in San Bernardino last December As we outlined last week Israels Cellebrite a provider of mobile forensic software was set to assist the Feds in their attempt to unlock the iPhoneThe government has now successfully accessed the data stored on Farooks iPhone and therefore no longer requires the assistance from Apple the Justice Department said in a filing embedded below Heres the mainstream media line from The New York Times Yet law enforcements ability to unlock an iPhone through an alternative method raises new uncertainties including questions about the strength of Apples security on its devices The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple Lawyers for Apple have previously said that the company would want to know the method used to crack open the device The government may make that method classified From a legal standpoint what happened in the San Bernardino case doesnt mean the fight is over said Esha Bhandari a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union She noted that the government generally goes through a process whereby it decides whether to disclose information about certain vulnerabilities so that manufacturers can patch them I would hope they would give that information to Apple so that it can patch any weaknesses she said but if the government classifies the tool that suggests it may not Right Or this could all be nonsense That is Apple may have just made America an unwitting participant in an iPublicity stunt as it were As we suggested just five days ago the entire Apple stand for privacy and consumer rights might be one big theatrical spectacle as both parties involved clearly were aware the iPhone can be penetrated with the right tools Heres AP The FBI says it successfully used a mysterious technique without Apples help to break into an iPhone linked to the gunman in a California mass shooting The government told a federal court Monday without any details that it accessed data on gunman Syed Farooks iPhone and no longer requiresApples assistance Farook and his wife died in a gun battle with police after killing people in San Bernardino California in December A US magistrate last month ordered Apple to provide the FBI with software to help it hack into Farooks workissued iPhone The order touched off a debate pitting digital privacy rights against national security concerns So just like that its all over No hard feelings And all of this on the heels of what is almost sure to go down as one of the biggest product launch flops in company history The timing of it all certainly leaves us with more questions than answers Mon Supernova Born Mon Cognitive Dissonance Small bills with random serial numbers please Mon Poundsand Yeah like I thought my phones digit code couldnt withstand long term and brute force computing to break it I for one am devastated Mon nuubee AHA LOL and all my friends thought I was nuts when I told them the gov was just whining and that they knew they could crack into it Mon TahoeBilly Mon DeadFred My lawyer daughter says Apple has a good case for suing Cellebrite for any damages caused by loss of consumer confidence in the security of the phone Unless they found a way to do the hack without actually pocessing a phone and clicking on those infamous human centipede conditions of service agreements Not hacking the phone is one of the agreements I hope GOV paid them enough assuming this wasnt all kabuki Mon chicaboomboom Mon greenskeeper carl Yep Hasnt it already been well established that the govt records and keeps pretty much everything you do with a cellphone or computer this was all just theater done to keep the rubes thinking they have some semblance of privacy Cant have a company as important to the stock market as apple taking a huge hit that would disrupt the everything is awesome meme a little too much Mon IndyPat Mon RiverRoad Mon DeadFred Of course Im going to send some random site my password so they can test it for security QWERTY can never be hacked anyway Mon redd_green Poundsand Re I hear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has great encryption If you want to know how good Microsofts software is go read about the MicrosoftTwitter artificial intelligence fiasco Heh Tue Farqued Up I sold all Apple stock the minute I heard the FBI got a rd party to break in so I sold the cheap shit Actually it was because I was getting ulcers from Spotted Al Gore being on their board Mon KirkNCC No doubt the Jihadistsintraining appreciate you telling them this so that they can whats the expression Adapt Improvise and Overcome Mon doctor American business remains DOA until the parties insist on real computer and communications security that leaves the triple alphabet mafia out of it all Mon DeadFred If we had real security how could the NSA front run the markets to get the money for all their black ops Wed have to print more money to fund them you fool gov and their Big Tech partners can access damn near anything Mon Cognitive Dissonance Mon NoWayJose So instead of helping the FBI and retaining control over the hacking technique Apple now has to convince consumers that the iPhone is secure even if it doesnt know what the mystery cracking technique is Mon kml Mon rmulus Mon undertow Apple should have agreeed to crack the phone themselves under cover of night Then everyone got what they wanted Apples illusion of security and the FBI an unlocked phone Now they have what apperently announces that all IPhone are easily broken into as the current encryption techinques didnt take hundreds of years with super computers to break it took months And now that they know how to do it it will only get easier to the point of inserting a flashdrive on your ICrap and it just unlocking Shoulda just opened the phone Tue BigDawgz And what makes you so certain that Apple DIDNT agree to help them break in There has been no mention of exactly WHO helped them nor how they did it Its quite conceivable that Apple cut a deal that said well help you break in but in return we get to make it appear that were championing the privacy of all Apple owners Its a winwinthe gubmint gets the BE help they wanted on the phone Apple gets the good guys advertising boost at a time when the company is struggling Theres plenty of sheeple out there that would go out buy an iPhone the next time just because they thought Apple was standing up for them in this was principled Mon XLS Mon BarkingCat If they force you to bake one for dykes decorate it with dicks Im sure the faggot judge would not be amused tho Mon undertow Mon Infield_Fly So why not fuck Cookie for a while just to piss him off a little Gummunt has all kinds of
