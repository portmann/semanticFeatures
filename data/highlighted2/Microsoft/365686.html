after the market close The last quarter saw a meaningful slowdown that the company was concerned about Some of the issues may have been a pullforward of sales We think the main issue however is a need for innovation We went back in time to see the impact of Steve Jobs absence and return In his absence from the stock went from to in years In his return the stock went to over a fold gain After his passing the stock has doubled in about five years There have been advancements but not the new wow product yet We think that he was the main impetus of innovation which is not an epiphany Business is an art of banking on key players and his business acumen was one of a kind Apple has a strong team and strong developers but Steve Jobs is missed GoogleAlphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT are all strong competitors looking for market share of every category Apple won through hardware innovation and keeping the software code inhouse Now other players are working fast to pass Apple on the software side on openness and ease of use for consumers and developers If it happens Apple turns back into a neat hardware pureplay so they need to pick up the innovation Smaller and thinner is a hardware strategy but not the high margin software gold The company has focused investors on its services growth and its installed base of late Core investors care about unit growth and topline growth The installed base on its own is an impressive number but is looking in retrospect on what the company has achieved The services piece also is exciting but much smaller than overall iPhone revenues and cannot at this stage make up for slowing iPhone sales By the company turning attention to other legs of the business it appears to be a sign that this leg iPhone could be in the later innings Apple has faced international volatility in the past but this one slowed the pace of revenues in a very short timeframe Typically their products have held them strong through such headwinds which was not the case this time In total of their business is overseas Were guessing about half of that or more is from emerging markets With the dollars recent weakness some of the currencies may be better this coming quarter but yearoveryear they are still down big which will continue to be a drag for them The currencies do not sound like the main issue however The economies are the main reason for the sales impact Major markets including Brazil Russia Japan Canada Southeast Asia Australia Turkey and the eurozone have been impacted by slowing economic growth falling commodity prices and weakening currencies Their largest international market may be at risk after seeing weakness in January Notwithstanding these record results we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month most notably in Hong Kong Weve invested through economic uncertainty in the past and weve always come out stronger on the other side We are providing a wider range for revenue than usual for the second quarter because of the volatility we are seeing in the economy and in the financial and currency markets After the report street earnings estimates for the quarter came down but the year did not move much The company blamed comparisons for some of the slowdown so we ran twoyear growth numbers which combines the growth rates from this year and last year The first quarter Dec did not show much of a twoyear slowdown This coming quarter the street numbers which follow the companys guidance do expect a bigger two year slowdown which aligns with their qualitative commentary that trends slowed further in January Heres what they said about the out quarters As you know we dont provide guidance beyond the current quarter and its difficult for us to forecast economic and foreign exchange factors However at this point we believe the March quarter faces the most difficult yearoveryear compare relative to the rest of the year They imply that trends should pick back up after the March quarter as comparisons ease While the year ago comparison do look easier after March when combining it with the year before it actually looks a little tougher on a twoyear basis Given the headwinds comparisons are not easy iPhone units at flattish growth is uninspiring Even if they maintain it or beat it it is not strong The rate of change of FQs slowdown is more severe than it has been in recent history Wed guess there is even a chance iPhone unit growth can go negative at some point this year That would be cause for concern Short interest is low which speaks to a general lack of official concern Most of the street seems to be recommending Apple We would probably be at a hold rating but given our concern of the overall market this is one story that could have more risk thus a sell rating Elazar Advisors LLC specializes in earnings and predicts
