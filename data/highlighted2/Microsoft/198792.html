class='textDiv'>Yahoo Trading Below The Sum Of Its Parts Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoo is in the process of using a Reverse Morris Trust transaction to spin off its Alibaba Stock The IRS has rejected an advanced taxfree transaction but has not denied the transaction as a whole The market has already accounted for a taxable spinoff in Yahoos current market stock price providing a limited downside to investment Yahoo has four main parts it owns of Alibaba of Yahoo Japan B in cash and the core US business Yahoo shares are trading at a discount to the sum of its parts and a profit may be realized by going long Yahoo We argue that the sum of Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO parts do not add up to its current market pricing Yahoo is being undervalued The numbers dont add up Yahoo owns M shares of Alibaba NYSE BABA at this is a market value of B Yahoo Japan has a market cap of B Giving both a liquidity discount of Yahoo Japan has a further tax discount of and then adding back the total B in cash we arrive at a per share value of while Yahoo is trading at an discrepancy All this assumes that the core US business is worth The core business although not a spectacular enterprise still generates normalized B in EBITDA annually so the valuation discrepancy is even higher By doing this trade we are essentially being paid to own Yahoos core business Assigning a x multiple to the core business results in a per share value of a premium to its current market value Our investment thesis comes in lieu of Yahoos tentative spinoff of Alibaba through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction This transaction structure would be preferable for a spinoff of Yahoos Asian businesses as Yahoo would not need to pay billions of dollars in taxes on the monetization of its investments on Yahoo Japan and Alibaba One main hurdle of this transaction structure is to get approval from the IRS In September Yahoos request for a favorable advanced ruling was denied by the IRS but Yahoo announced that it would go through with its plans to carry out its planned spinoff despite such a decision One of the prerequisites for the RMT transaction is that the subsidiary to be merged with an external company has its own operating business which is why Yahoo is planning on including the Yahoo Small Business segment in the spinoff Whether this action will allow the transaction to comply with RMT regulations is still uncertain and some tax experts suspect that the IRS may view the Yahoo Small Business segment as too small or not an active business However if the IRS wanted to completely stop Yahoo it could have easily made a ruling that rejected their proposal instead of only denying an expedited spinoff We take the view that Yahoo will be able to conduct the spinoff taxfree with a very low chance of the IRS pursuing litigation and winning in court Global search engines have thrived in the last years due to advanced technology and worldwide reach Larger user bases for search engines like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Bing warrant larger amounts of data collection and analysis which improves future search speed and efficiency In profit margins industrywide peaked at and in the last five years the industry has seen steady revenue growth and is expected to grow in The search engine industry also has experienced increases in workforce between and the industry workforce grew annually on average Improving economic conditions should further foster growth in the industry The industry also has become a marketing outlet due to large user bases Companies have mastered the simple art of search engine optimization which allows their company to show up among top results on major search engines According to a survey by iProspect a digital marketing firm around of search engine users believe that the companies showing up at the top of search results are industry leaders Because of this companies have devoted resources on advertising via search engines The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimates of internet advertising expenditures by firms focused on search engines in Yahoo has experienced difficulty in generating revenue and has lost a chunk of market share to formidable competitors Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT s Bing But that should not discourage investors seeking to profit from Yahoos latest transaction with Alibaba The key to growth for companies with strong search engines is balancing out highmargin search engine divisions with additional businesses For Yahoo this includes its acquisitions of Tumblr and Flickr as well as its content creation networks through Yahoo Sports and Yahoo News which provides additional advertising revenue Yahoos adjusted EBITDA showed a contraction in the first quarter of However as can be evidenced through the graph Yahoo usually performs on par or better throughout the other quarters As for revenue Yahoo has increased revenue by million from Q to Q to Its stake in earnings from search has increased by from Q of to Q of as a portion of total revenue Revenue from searches has increased by million from to while display revenue has increased by million Both global search trends and global display trends show signs of a positive future for Yahoo graphs provided by Yahoo Investor Relations Although the priceperclick for search has decreased the significant increase in number of paid clicks to in Q to Q has offset this loss a net increase of about in profit from increase in searches The same trend holds true for Q to Q in display revenue the net profitability went up from about to The market is pricing the Aabaco Holdings spinoff at near its worstcase scenario namely that the spinoff will be subject to the full tax The value of Yahoos BABA holdings will account for per share if subjected to the full taxation Valuing Yahoo Japan at full asset value the sum of its BABA shares Yahoo Japan shares and cash comes to per share only slightly lower than the market value of Adding in the US Core Business valued at a x multiple gives a downside case of per share implying a margin of safety of These calculations are performed with numbers found through Capital IQ and Wikinvest Its clear that the market is pricing Yahoo at its worstcase scenario regarding the monetization of its holdings in Alibaba As such purchasing shares in Yahoo presents a limited downside investment with the potential for profit if the spinoff proves to be taxfree which we are confident in To hedge out the risk of the falling value of Alibaba shares and Yahoo Japan one might buy Yahoo and simultaneously short BABA and Yahoo Japan to own only the undervalued US Core Business Another way to see this is that by being short BABA and Yahoo Japan and long Yahoo we are essentially being paid to own the US core business The market assigning a near zero value to the core business is definitely a mispricing and presents an attractive investment
