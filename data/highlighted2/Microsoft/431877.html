</span>NASDAQ MSFT posted an impressive yearoveryear increase in quarterly revenue from Surface products Strong sales of the pricey Surface Book and the Surface Pro helped the Surface product line achieve sales of billion during Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also raked in billion in sales from Surface products in Q year over year This robust growth in Surface revenue defied the yearoveryear decline in enterprise tablet shipments that Strategy Analytics reported Investors should also take note that while the Surface is seeing surging sales Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported a yearoveryear decline in iPad revenue for the period covering Q I now propose that Microsofts new installment plans for its Surface products can further worsen the declining sales of the iPad The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface Membership plan allows big and small companies to purchase Surface products under very affordable monthly plans Unless Apple can match the low monthly plans of the Surface Pro month and Surface month I predict that many more companies will snob the iPad Pro As far as I know Apple has yet to implement an installment plan for its flagship in iPad product Canalys reported that the Surface Pro was already notably outselling the iPad Pro in the UKs enterprise market k versus only k for the iPad Pro <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>expanding its Surface Membership installment plan to include other countries could devastate the iPad Pros future in the enterprise The ARMbased iOS iPad Pro is already at a disadvantage since it cannot run custom legacy xonly enterprise software Expanding the Surface monthly installment program could eventually make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a top tablet vendor As of now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is not yet among the top global vendors of tablets On the other hand the surging popularity of the pricey Surface products has made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the worlds No tablet vendor by value share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors should also appreciate that unlike the share of Windows in smartphones Windows touts share in tablet shipments Implementing the Surface Membership installment program could further boost Windows share in consumer and enterprise tablets The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface Membership program will also seriously affect the appeal of Apples MacBook products The lack of touchscreen display and in functionality of MacBooks already make them less attractive than the Surface The chart below from TrendForce clearly illustrates that Apple already has a MacBook problem Looking at the chart above I deduce that the iPad Pro and the Surface products had something to do with MacBook laptops posting a yearoveryear decline in Q My old article speculated that Apple likes differentiating its products to better monetize from its loyal customers Unfortunately for Apple the dualpurpose tabletlaptop usability of the Surface Pro and Surface Book is why budgetminded business users strongly embraced them wholeheartedly Unlike affluent individual consumers companies have to observe budget limits when purchasing computers for their employees It makes economic sense for companies to just rent out a Surface Pro for month than to immediately spend for a MacBook Pro plus for an iPad Air I will remain long on MSFT The affordable installment program for Surface tabletlaptop computers is an important tailwind for Microsofts plan to become a highend PC hardware vendor Anything that improves the chances of Surface computers beating the iPadMacBook in

the month Surface is suitable for high school and college students <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs a Windows computer installment program to help slow down the rapid
