my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Alphabet has passed Apple to be the worlds largest company What company will reach the trilliondollar threshold first Markets were basically flat to kick off the new week We started the day with another oildriven selloff but by the end of the day markets had recovered with all three major indices posting minor gains Despite the rather minor gains the market continues to calm down The VIX closed under for just the second time this year The volatility ETFs NYSEARCA VXX NYSEARCA UVXY were down a fair bit on the day despite the flat market And perhaps more remarkably the market was flat despite oil NYSEARCA USO getting pounded WTI crude was down on the day and is down more this evening with crude now back to after hitting just a couple days ago Pay attention to the WTIBrent NYSEARCA BNO spread particularly if you own refiners Brent is holding up better lately and now fetches a barrel premium to WTI crude In the past a big oil drop such as this would have sent the market right back into a tailspin Instead the market managed to hold its ground despite oil natural gas NYSEARCA UNG and energy stocks NYSEARCA XLE all selling off As of this writing the ES SP NYSEARCA SPY futures contract is down around points or half a percent Perhaps the market will try to sell off with oil down again tonight At this hour reports are coming in that BP NYSE BP missed on earnings with the income figure down an eyecatching This will likely hurt energy sentiment as well But it seems the general trend is that the market is decoupling from oil and China NYSEARCA ASHR and concentrating on earnings For the health of the market thats a good development Speaking of earnings Google or Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL if you prefer is now the worlds largest company Following a strong earnings report shares jumped in the afterhours session The move was sufficient to allow Apple NASDAQ AAPL to be overtaken in the top of the market cap list for the first time in several years Apple first topped the list in passing Exxon NYSE XOM for the honors Its stock initially continued to rise after passing Exxon but its been mostly dead money since then Anyone that invested in Apple once it hit has lagged the market significantly This chart from Quartz shows the evolution of Apple and Alphabets market caps over time After that strong run in its been slow going for Apple The rule of large numbers applies in cases such as this Once youre already the biggest its hard to meaningfully continue to expand A strategy of buying the markets largest company and holding it has been shown to vastly underperform buying a basket of stocks Take this comparison from the Hulbert Financial Digest Also of note in roughly of years since the largest marketcap stock entering the year has underperformed the broader index Its a wellknown phenomenon that small caps tend to outperform large cap stocks Naturally these extend even within the large cap space Buying the largest of the megacaps seems to degrade your returns even further If you are into this sort of data trade you can argue for a short Alphabet long market trade Based on past history it seems likely to work I dont see Alphabets valuation as particularly wild though at least not compared to other FANG and tech momo stocks It more passed Apple because Apple is falling rather than GOOG going crazy Ive long been skeptical about Apple Many value investors say the stock is cheap and with further financial engineering more value could be unlocked But Im not sure I see it The companys main product the iPhone appears to have reached a sales peak Other lines such as iPad are in rapid decline The company will continue to be a cash cow but with such a huge valuation already if you want upside to the stock you need something new to drive growth Last year analysts were pointing to the auto market as the magic bullet that would fix Apples growth problem Its unclear what the new solution will be Until they figure something out I struggle to see why Id rather own Apple than an index fund As for Alphabet its a company Id rather invest in than Apple Theres more upside as the company has a lot more innovation and new potential revenue streams in the pipeline However I dont really trust the company as capital allocators and if I were long Id fret that they might invest my money poorly in unsound new initiatives To put it frankly Im unlikely to own the worlds largest company by market cap for quite a while longer If oil and Exxon come back into favor Id be long the worlds largest company again Or perhaps Berkshire NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB will be able move to the top As far as handicapping the race to be the first trilliondollar company Id put Alphabet as the favorite followed by Exxon and Berkshire as the two next best possibilities I see Apple as distinctly unlikely to hit the trilliondollar market cap anytime soon Theyd need a whole new category iPhone wont do it alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is in the current market cap top five but again I struggle to see what would fundamentally shake up their valuation enough to double the market cap to a billion Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is one more darkhorse pick to be the worlds first trilliondollar company Its hard to imagine quite how outlandish its valuation ratios would appear at that figure but as proved that stock doesnt seem to be limited by traditional financial logic </div></body></html>
