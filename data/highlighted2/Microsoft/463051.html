starting with Warren Buffetts annual letter and continuing with various WSJ reports that the SEC would crack down on the practice there had been speculation that nonGAAP adjustments would be phased out But not yet because if it wasnt for nonGAAP addbacks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would have missed badly on both the top and the bottom line As the company reported moments ago its GAAP revenue and EPS were billion and both far below expectations of bn and However when one adds back such items as Windows deferrals to revenue yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is not content with only fudging EPS it did so to the topline too like Tesla and Impairment integration and Restructuring charges associated with the companys performance of its phone business one gets nonGAAP revenue and EPS of billion and both comfortably beating expectations and why notafter all courtesy of nonGAAP addbacks its actual EPS number was boosted by All thanks to the oldest accounting trick in the book But wait thats not all because aside from MSFTs revenue nonGAAP adjustments the company decided to pull IBMs favorite trick namely adjusting tax rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>somehow ended up paying a paltry million on pretax income of billion or about To wit The current quarter effective tax rate reflected a favorable mix of our income between the US and foreign countries as well as benefits associated with distributions from foreign affiliates As such the GAAP and nonGAAP tax rates were and respectively In other words if MSFT had used a typical corporate tax rate of EPS would have been sufficiently low to where the company may have missed consensus earnings either GAAP or nonGAAP For now however the market is delighted with this flagrant sleight of hand and at last check the company was trading about higher in the after hours session froze BullyBearish Jul PM At what point do you look at a company and just call bull shit I mean really your either making money or your not Are you beating estimates that are based on GAAP or just being earnings based on whatever the hell you decide to base

They both suck Hey say what you want about Bill Gates it takes real guts to name your Fortune company after the two most common adjectives women use to describe your performance in bed Micro and soft Theyre flooring it now and theyre going to floor it right up until the day the engine explodes What else can they do Admit they were wrong change course Nope Probably theyll just start a war and try to run to Urugauy with the loot Gawd I love the smell of cynicism And you gots to know that there are more than a few Csuite occupants at MSFT that read ZH on a daily basis same as the rest Good What an overbloated pig It used to be cheap at now they basically have the same earnings and it trades at Oh the wonders of multiple expansion Their business model is to make people pay to be spied on Windows and the really big one SUCK The only decent operating systems theyve had in the past twenty years has been XP and Windows From this point on it will be either OS X or Linux for me Dell
