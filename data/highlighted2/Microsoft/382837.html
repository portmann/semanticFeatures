business model than Intel Strategic Imperatives of IBMs total revs is seeing slowing growth not good Simply IBM needs to start growing again Cash flow has stabilized which is a plus Intel and the capex issue continues to weigh on the stock IBM NYSE IBM the mainstream technology giant that has had to reinvent itself several times over the last years from the s bigiron moniker to todays services giant reports their calendar Q financial results after the bell tonight Monday April For IBM tonight Street consensus is expecting in earnings per share EPS on billion in revenue for expected yearoveryear yy growth of in EPS on a decline in revenue Current expectations for Q think guidance shows that Street consensus has modeled in earnings per share on billion in revenue for a yy decline in EPS on yy decline in revenue For fullyear the Street is expecting in earnings per share on billion in revenue for expected declines of and respectively for this calendar year Since IBM reported their Q in the middle of the sharp selloff in the first weeks of calendar the worst start to any year in terms of the equity markets ever the stock has traded up from to on both the rally in the SP technology in general and the timely upgrade of IBMs by Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty Hubertys upgrade also coincided with the billion Truven acquisition and a number of small bolton acquisitions IBM made in February such as Resilent Systems and a couple of strategic partnerships with VMWare and GitHub none of which I am really personally familiar with Here is a favorable WSJ Heard on the Street column that ran in midFebruary roughly at the time of the Morgan Stanley upgrade talking about the changes at IBM While the stock has rallied sharply the last months my biggest concern is that the Strategic Imperatives initiative which was the Cloudbased wave of the future type longerterm investment that was going to stabilize IBMs revenue and EPS declines actually saw slower growth in Q down to from the previous growth rates In addition IBMs Software segment which is roughly of revenue has seen negative yy revenue growth for at least straight quarters and last quarter was down yy better but still negative The positives for IBM is that the yy declines are getting less negative the weaker dollar will help and cashflow and freecashflow growth has actually been mildly positive the last quarters which probably demonstrates the impact on currency on the income statement better than any commentary The bottom line is IBM needs to return to positive growth for the stock to move higher permanently and there does remain a big question mark about when and how that will happen Valuation Given the current forward EPS and revenue estimates IBM is likely fairly valued at per share trading at x forward earnings for negative expected growth in and a return to growth in and IBMs cashflow valuation is x cashflow and x freecashflow as of the December quarter with a dividend and a dividend yield IBM boosted their quarterly dividend from to the current last year and another dividend boost is at hand The previous increase was from to per quarter so a small percentage increase might be at hand as the company works through the transition Technical analysis IBM is trading above its day moving average for the first time since last summer and before that it was A drop back into the area on light volume would be a good place to add to the stock A trade through on heavy volume could mean a retest of the low this Q That wouldnt be good Conclusion While investors have become very frustrated with the decline in IBM from in mid to with the last earnings report the timely Morgan Stanley upgrade might have put a bottom in the shares For me I need to see some currencyneutral revenue and earnings growth from IBM to induce me to add to the current position which has been held in client accounts for years What will be particularly critical tonight for investors in my opinion is Strategic Imperatives growth rate and the Software segments growth rate as well as currency neutral revenue growth The dollar should start to have a diminished impact on IBMs results If IBMs EPS and revenue declines can moderate and start to reflect lowsingledigit positive growth Intel NASDAQ INTC reports their Q financial results the bell on Tuesday April th Street consensus is expecting in earnings per share on billion in revenue for expected yy growth of and respectively That is decent growth in this stock market Fullyear estimates are expecting in earnings on billion in revenue which is expected earnings growth on revenue growth which tells me that despite decent Q growth expectations are tempered for the rest of the year One of the frustrations with owning INTCs stock over the years is that try as they might the business model is still anchored to the PC business The stock ran from the low s to the high s in all driven by positive comments from the Windows Vista refresh to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and then faded after that uptick in PC growth faded Intels Data Center segment has risen from of Intels total revenue to as of Q while as a percentage of operating income Data Center has varied from to of Intels total It is still the PC Client Group where Intel gets its earnings delta in terms of really driving the stock price so with Gartner Group coming out and saying PC growth fell in Q the expectations for the segment are likely subdued Over the years though my biggest worry has been Intels annual capex load which is roughly of Intels revenue Ive compared it to running a marathon or triathlon with a piano on your back as was detailed in Seeking Alpha articles here and here Here was an article written comparing Intel to Texas Instruments The Texan started going fabless last decade which reduced that cashflow drag and it showed up in their results but TXN also had the end markets for it as Ive learned over time Intels incredible dominance and strength in the s and s as the lowcost microprocessor manufacturer for the PC sector became an Achilles Heel when PC growth became a replacement market and slowed significantly Intel Valuation Trading at x s expected earnings with an expected earnings per share growth rate the next three years on a expected revenue run rate Intel is mired in this slow growth no growth PC world Management has made a lot of noise about being a provider of drone chips and other processors to the everevolving world technology gadgets but like mobile chips Intels core competitive advantage still resides in PCs Trading at x cashflow and x freecashflow INTC in neither cheap nor rich Intels annual dividend results in a current dividend yield and the company has done a better job managing insider selling in terms of stock options although Q saw the ISO incentive stock options absorb nearly rd of the quarterly share repurchase to avoid the dilution Conclusion Intels capex requirement has caused some issues with the company outside of Intel just not growing very much particularly in the dividend and returnofcapital aspects of Intel and how they treat shareholders Ive beaten the topic into a coma but that is what is required since capex impacts cashflow and freecashflow Im very frustrated with the stock and Ive heard for the last years about this latest transition or this newest chip is going to restore Intels revenue and earnings growth and it hasnt happened only when we see a surge in PC sales does Intel see revenue or EPS surge Article Summary Comparing IBM and Intel Both IBM and Intel are oldschool tech giants that essentially have to completely realign their business models to emerging secular trends within Technology the most prominent of which is the Cloud IBM has been through far more critical transitions simply because the company has been around longer Intel is finding out how tough it is to grow when your strategic competitive advantage becomes a competitive weakness IBM spends of their operating cashflow on capex while Intels spends Intels business has a far higher degree of operating leverage than IBMs since Intel is primarily a manufacturing business while IBM is a service business Both stocks are reasonablyvalued albeit with no growth Trading at x x cash flow with good dividends IBM is in a better position to generate shareholderfriendly returnofcapital decisions simply because of the lower capex IBMs dividend as a of freecashflow is roughly low to mid range while INTCs is mid to high range IBM has for the last few years spent less dollar repurchasing shares sold from ISOs from which readers can conclude IBM is making better use of the share repurchase program While Intels Data Center Group DCG is their emerging growth technology segment for IBM is their Strategic Imperatives Segment This is likely where the future lies with both companies but eventually both segments need to move the needle in terms of total revenue and EPS This article is in no way a call or tonights IBM earnings or tomorrows Intel earnings call although I am biased to IBM at this point simply because of their business model and the transitions they have had to make over the years Big Blue should be able to navigate this latest transition and drive growth at Strategic Imperatives My impression of Intel is that they remain stuck within the core PC competency and Im growing frustrated with the long position in the stock As the old saying goes guntothehead if I had to buy just one of the two stocks to hold between now and yearend it would be IBM Disclosure I amwe are long IBM INTC I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Technology CFA charterholders Earnings </div></body></html>
