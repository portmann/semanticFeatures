some of GameStops business model under threat Weve been longtime bulls and multiyear holders of GameStop NYSE GME but some recent developments in the retailing and gaming world have us taking a hard look at our investment In fact we are actively considering selling the remainder of our shares we reduced our position in GameStop by half for most clients when the stock traded around per share In previous articles weve explained why we liked GameStop why we thought digital wasnt as big a threat as it was made out to be and why GameStop wasnt like Blockbuster But to understand the recent threats we need to understand what is really GameStops core business model At its very simplest GameStops business model is selling video games for Its business model is not simply retailing physical versions of new and used video game software like many believe Why GameStop has managed to stay in business despite the threat of digital has been its extremely successful buyselltrade model that allows gamers to pay only either through trade in credits or by waiting for a used copy for a video game that would otherwise retail for Many people in the investment world that Ive talked to about GameStop have well above average incomes For them the difference between and is not material and I have found they really did not grasp GameStops appeal to gamers when discussing the company When I talked to my friends who are avid gamers and browse several gaming forums Ive found that many of them have below average incomes and to them trading in their old games is key to making the new titles affordable to them Previously GameStop did not face any significant threats to its underlying business model but that looks to be changing The biggest threat I see for GameStop is Amazons NASDAQ AMZN decision to begin offering discounts on video games to Amazon Prime subscribers As you can see below that means new video games we checked the price of MLB The Show for PS are being retailed by Amazon for This move is threatening the low end of GameStops buyselltrade model If youre a hardcore gamer who loves to buy the newest game play it through and then trade it in to get the latest release Amazon doesnt offer a compelling value If you just got done playing Tom Clancys The Division you could trade it for MLB The Show and pay a net price of assuming youre a PRO member This is well below Amazons price Next we looked up the trade in value for Need for Speed which was released in If youre not quite that dedicated to gaming and are trading in a popular old game from last year youll get around in a trade in This still gives you a net price of for a new video game Again well below Amazon However things change if you just play games occasionally and dont always want or buy the latest and greatest If you have an old game from say sitting around and trade it in you only get around Below is the price quote we got for Need for Speed Rivals from This would put your net price for a new game right in the same neighborhood as Amazoncom Odds are that as a casual gamer youll find Amazons two day delivery just as convenient as making a special trip into a GameStop store This is what Amazons threat looks like today The big question is what will it look like in the future Remember Amazon is a company that seemingly despises profits What might Amazon be willing to do to take more of the market from GameStop Also remember Amazon is experimenting with dronebased minutes or less delivery for packages Would you rather make a minute round trip to a local GameStop or spending minutes playing your old video game while you wait for a drone to deliver your new one Were likely years away from a scenario like that being widespread but the stock market is forward looking According to a recent customer survey posted on reddit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is exploring the possibility of digital tradeins for the Xbox One If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>eventually went through with the plan it looks like the model would allow users to trade in a game for of the purchase price in online store credit While back on a video game isnt great it is something Much like Amazons Prime discount program Microsofts potential model is aimed at the customers that make up a minority of GameStops customer base Very casual gamers and more well off gamers where an extra isnt worth a or minute trip to a GameStop store Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>denied via Twitter that digital tradeins are being considered But there is a big difference between not being considered now and being ruled out for eternity Additionally company executives across all industries are not know for their truthfulness when it comes to disclosing product plans Given the size of the used game market B I find it hard to believe companies like Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>arent actively trying to find a way to muscle in What we believe we are seeing with Amazons move and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>floating the idea of digital used game tradeins is the beginning of the erosion of GameStops business model that the short sellers have been clamoring about for years Remember GameStops business is selling games for The closer competitors get to that price point the greater the threat to GameStop Right now it appears that competitors are just nibbling at the edges of GameStops customer base but we believe that as time goes on the industry will start taking a bigger bite We are currently evaluating investment alternatives to GameStop and would encourage other holders to reevaluate their investment
