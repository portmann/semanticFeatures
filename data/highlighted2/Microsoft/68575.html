to the idea of dualOS mobile devices Samsung is working on a dualOS smartphonelaptop product Samsung will need an x processor for its upcoming dualOS smartphonestablets Aside from testing an Android tablet with an Intel NASDAQ INTC Atom x Cherry Trail processor Samsung OTCSSNLF is also apparently working on a dualOS smartphone design Patently Mobile said Samsung recently filed a patent application for a dualoperating system smartphone Samsungs dualOS smartphone will dock and become the computer processing unit CPU of a laptop The image below illustrates the unique approach of Samsung when it comes to making smartphones function as mini computers Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Continuum for Windows Phones concept requires a cable connection to HDMI monitors Samsungs idea is to dock a smartphone in to a slot on top of the QWERTY keyboard of a laptop Microsofts Continuum for Windows Phones concept requires a cable connection to HDMI monitors Once docked the Samsung smartphone can switch from Android OS to Windows operating system A dualOS smartphone that can run x architectureexclusive Windows software like Photoshop and AutoCAD is a brilliant idea which could help Samsung attract more corporate clients Unlike last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now supporting the dualOS WindowsAndroid concept Digitimes supply chain sources said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is subsidizing Chinese whitebox manufacturers including those who create dualOS tablets per device The dualOS tabletin notebook concept is also backed by Intel which first broached the idea during the CES January event Chinese firms Teclast and Cube are among the new OEM partners of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that will preinstall Office and Skype on Android devices Teclast and Cube already sells excellent Intelpowered dualOS tablets Chuwi is another major Chinese vendor that sells a dualOS WindowsAndroid tablet hybrid tabletnotebook However Samsungs unique dualOS smartphonedockedtoalaptop design could be better than the current detachabletablet form factor used by dualOS device manufacturers Instead of attaching a detachable inch or inch tablet to a keyboardtouchpad dock Samsung wants the smallersize smartphone to get attached to a brainless laptop with a bigger display Enterprise users may find editing Excel spreadsheets a little uncomfortable on the inch display of the Chuwi Vi Samsung will need to use x processors to implement its dualOS smartphone concept All existing dualOS tabletsnotebooks available right now use Intel processors Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA have yet to release an ARMbased processor that could run the full Windows OS Even Asustek OTCASUUY used an Intel Core i and an Intel Atom SoC for its dualOS Transformer Book Trio TX notebook The cheap dualOS phablets from Chuwi and Teclast use the tray Intel Atom ZF SoC The Cube i Air G uses the Atom ZF The subsidies from Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for dualOS tablets may extend to smartphones in the future The new Atom x is Windows ready I expect majority of Chinese whitebox OEMs to also create dualOS phones in the near future Elephones upcoming dualOS phone is a flagship product that has GB of RAM and a quadcore Intel processor It should meet the hardware requirements of Continuum for Windows phones Samsungs backing of the dualOS concept is another reason to stay or go long on INTC Samsungs patented dualOS smartphonelaptop design will not compete directly with existing dualOS products from Chinese OEMs Samsung will likely release a premium enterprisecentric dualOS smartphone with a price tag above Intel stands to gain a lot if Samsung makes bulk purchases of the highermargin Atom X or X processors Samsung needs powerful x processors to create enterpriseworthy smartphonesminicomputers The mighty purchasing power of Chinese OEMs is another tailwind for Intel Whitebox manufacturers are also buyers of highermargin x processors Aside from Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Cube is also one of the first firms to use the Core M processors The Cube i Windows tablet and the Onda Vw in notebooks are equipped with the tray Intel Core MYC SoC The copycat nature among hardware vendors is beneficial to Intel With the help of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel Chinese companies were able to create cheaper clones of the Asus Transformer Book Trio I expect Chinese OEMs to create clones of Samsungs new dualOS smartphonelaptop concept product Elephones dualOS Windows Android smartphone will inspire dozens of copycat products too The more factories that create dualOS mobile devices the better it is for Intel Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated
