must adapt with current trends We should all know that like all other PC vendors Apple also posted negative YoY growth for Q Gartner said Apple NASDAQ AAPL increased its market share in PC sales in Q However IDCs chart below says Apple like other top PC vendors also posted negative growth in Mac sales during the most recent quarter Gartner claimed that Apple Mac sales increased YoY but IDC said the global shipment of Macs for Q was actually YoY compared to Q I will go with the assessment of IDC that Mac sales still declined by volume in spite of it growing its market share from to I say so because I believe that the lack of touchscreenenabled Mac computers also made it vulnerable to a current market trend toward touchscreen computers like the upcoming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is now taking preorders of the Surface Pro Microsofts equalizer to the MacBook Pro will likely get shipped before ends Mac sales also may continue to drop because the notouchscreen policy of Apple right now is an obvious Achilles heel that Windows PC vendors will continue to exploit While its rivals Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY Dell Acer and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ are now selling touchscreenequipped desktop and laptop computers Applebranded computers are still stuck in the notouchscreendisplay era Yes Apple computers have been posting an impressive growth rate recently in spite of the mainstream decline in PC sales However Apples product differentiation policy that compels it to never release a touchfriendly Mac OS X computer could ultimately relegate Mac OS X PCs to a zerogrowth or declining niche The ambitious entry of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a laptop vendor also is a clear and present danger to the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air sales As you can see below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is leveraging Amazons online marketplace to disseminate its first highend laptop Its geared toward highincome customers of the MacBook Pro The Surface Book has a touchscreenfriendly and detachable PixelSense inch display that no MacBook Pro can match right now There also are dozens of new allinone touchenabled desktop PCs that are cheaper than the iMac The HP Z G allinone is as powerful as any Apple iMac Retina available now Unless Apple surrenders to the current trend toward touchscreenequipped computers I fear that the Macs current popularity will eventually wane I understand that Apple wants to maximize monetization of diehard Mac users by not giving them a touchenabled computer They will be forced to buy an iPad or an iPad Pro as a companion tool for their expensive MacBook Pros and Mac Pro computers if they want touchscreen productivity However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and its partner OEMs are now shifting toward an alltouchscreen PC product lineup This could eventually persuade even the most ardent Macusing graphic artist to defect As long as Tim Cook does not allow a touchscreenfriendly Mac computer design Apples PC business is in danger of repeating the same downward spiral of iPad sales The cultlike following of the Mac is what is helping it gain traction now However this is not going to last forever <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has the advertising budget to aggressively promote its Surface Book and Surface Pro as superior alternatives to outdated Mac laptops that still rely on mouse and keyboard operations Smart consumers will obviously see the great savings in buying just the in Surface Pro instead of buying the MacBook Air and the iPad Pro Mac computers running a Yosemite or newer OS should be able to go full touchscreenfriendly It is only Apples love for its lucrative product differentiation that is holding back touchenabled Mac computers Enterprising Americans are now exploiting this by modifying MacBooks to function like Mac OS X tablets ModBook buys Macbooks and then modifies them to work with a touchscreen display Their clients are mostly creative professionals like me I believe Apple is missing a great opportunity to really dominate the PC market by refusing to equip its Mac computers with a touchscreen display Consequently I will not endorse a buy for AAPL Tim Cook should not ignore the threat posed by touchscreenfriendly Windows desktop computers and laptops I hope that he will eventually change his mind like he did last year when he finally released phabletsized iPhones last year The product differentiation needed to sell a nontouchscreen Macbook to force loyal Apple users to also get the iPad is not tenable in the long run Imitating the largescreen phablets of Samsung OTC SSNLF definitely helped the iPhone and iPhone Plus to break record sales In the future when MacBook sales go stagnant Apple will have no choice but to also imitate the in form factor and touchscreen
