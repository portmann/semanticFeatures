class='textDiv'>MicrosoftLinkedIn Key Takeaways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha On Monday morning many investors were surprised by the announcement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT was buying LinkedIn NYSE LNKD for more than billion net of cash Congrats to all those who held shares of LinkedIn as you received a very nice reward this morning For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>however this felt like a bit of a stretch which is why I believe shares are down a couple of dollars Here are my key takeaways from this deal With iPhone sales struggling weve heard a number of calls suggesting that Apple NASDAQ AAPL go out and buy Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA This is because investors want to see growth and Apple is struggling on its top and bottom lines currently Well the same situation is happening with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now If we take a look at current estimates analysts are forecasting a decline in revenues this fiscal year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>In the next fiscal year growth is called for but the twoyear total is for just With the changing PC environment and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>handing out free upgrades to Windows the company was looking for a new source of revenue This purchase will help with that although LinkedIn is projecting just billion of revenues this year while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is in the mid billion area <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is paying per share in cash to acquire LinkedIn a substantial premium for a stock that closed Friday at and that included about in net cash as of LinkedIns latest quarter Additionally LinkedIn shares traded as low as earlier this year after a huge earnings report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is giving a nearly premium for a stock thats rallied more than from its low seen just a few months ago Is LinkedIn really worth basically double what the market thought it was worth just a few months ago Well lets compare LinkedIn to peers Facebook NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR Since it will take a number of months for the deal to be completed Im looking at nonGAAP PE ratios for these names based on expected earnings and Monday morning share prices The results are seen below LinkedIn doesnt boast a revenue growth percentage anywhere close to that of Facebook and is basically along the lines of Twitter On a nonGAAP EPS basis LinkedIn is expected to see total growth this year and next while Twitter is at and Facebook is a bit over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is paying nearly twice what the two peers trade for on a PE basis With the median price target on LinkedIn being just I think this is a big overpay Technology companies especially those that have blossomed in recent years have some of the most confusing and lengthy earnings reports Thats because they use both GAAP and nonGAAP numbers where the nonGAAP ones can have many adjustments to exclude things like stock based compensation restructurings acquisitions etc Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is one of the old guard names it uses a variety of figures as seen in the most recent earnings release I dont think the picture will get any cleaner once LinkedIn numbers are included in Microsofts results Microsofts GAAP results will worsen a bit it seems and the company suggested it could take almost two years for nonGAAP EPS to be accretive from this deal I can only imagine how much more complex these earnings reports will look after this deal is finished I was actually working on a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>dividend article this month but that will be delayed a bit thanks to this major acquisition In the news release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said that the purchase will be primarily financed through debt Thats because the company doesnt want to really dilute investors and Microsofts cash balance in the US is quite low As seen on page of the most recently filed Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had less than billion in cash and equivalents in the US with almost billion held by foreign subsidiaries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also stated that it expects to complete its billion buyback by the end of this calendar year and billion remained as of March st With a lot of debt being added to the balance sheet and buyback plans being unchanged I do think that well see a smaller than previously expected dividend raise this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was up over billion in total debt as of the latest quarter up from less than billion a year earlier As the foreign cash balance continues to grow one must wonder if the company will eventually bite the bullet and repatriate funds Otherwise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will probably need to take on even more debt just to keep the dividend going given the current situation Microsofts purchase of LinkedIn will certainly shake up the technology landscape The technology giant needed to find a new source of growth although the purchase price seems a bit excessive The deal will certainly complicate Microsofts financials and I also think it will hurt this years dividend raise given Microsofts low US cash balance and fast growing debt pile The decline in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>share price seems like the right reaction in the shortterm and it will take a while
