class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Gave Up On Selling Cheap Lumia Phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will now only focus on enterprisecentric phones I expect other companies to pick up the entrylevel Windows phone business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs a Surface phone with an Intel x processor I called for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to quit making cheap Lumia Windows phones ten days ago I said it would be smart if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stopped competing with other Windows phone makers like Acer My wish came true <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>made it very clear two days ago that it is getting out of the entrylevel phone hardware business Selling sub Lumia phones was a hardearned lesson for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The people who buy entrylevel phones are unlikely to buy annual subscriptions to Office Nadella now wants to focus solely on making phones for enterprise customers and consumers who appreciate phones with Continuum features This move will let top PC vendors now also phone vendors like Acer to be more enthusiastic in supporting Windows Mobile I firmly believe that profit margin consideration is why top PC and Android phone vendors like Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY never made any move to make lowend Windows Mobile handsets It would be detrimental to Lenovo to sell Windows phones when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>itself was selling sub Lumia phones Below is a partial screenshot from the PR News Wire press release of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Microsofts streamlined phone hardware strategy is now intended to the types of customers who made Surface Pro very successful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>already wrote off billion over its phone business last year Another billion impairment this year should not be as painful The more important thing now is that Nadella is retrenching most of the employees it inherited from Nokia NYSE NOK <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also got million when it sold its Nokiabranded feature phone business to Foxconn last week This money from Foxconn will reduce the impact of the billion impairment Unlike Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does not yet have an effective advertising strategy on how it could monetize buyers of entrylevel phones I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could only recoup the hardware losses it incurs from selling sub Lumia handsets via mobile ads Unfortunately its Bing mobile search engine has less than market share in phones and tablets Google was willing to sell Android One phones because it knew it can make money from them through search and appinstall ads Making the Bing Search app available to Android users and iOS device users is clearly not helping Bing Ads acquire more advertising eyeballs If it was effective the more than billion users of Android devices would have helped increased market share of Bing Search on mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also does not own any popular social networkingbased mobile apps like Facebook NASDAQ FB There is no way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could ever get a foothold in the lucrative mobileapp install business Instead of buying Nokias phone business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should have bought Facebook before it did its IPO Facebook is now enjoying million of mobile daily active users Having such a massive presence among the lives of mobile device owners allowed Facebook to rake in an estimated billion from appinstall ads last year In short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is like Apple NASDAQ AAPL These two decadesold companies are ineffective when it comes to mobile advertising Apple disbanded its iAd sales team last January Come June Apple will also shut down its iAd App Network <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>unloaded its digital display ads business to AOL last year My point is that Microsofts new focus on highmargin enterprisecentric smartphones is it trying to be more like Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>tried the cheapphonesforbuildingadaudience tactic but failed to build an advertising platform Another reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can no longer afford to sell cheap phones is that it no longer makes as much money as it used to from Android licensing fees I argued two years ago that the easy money from Android patent licensing fees was financing Microsofts foray into phone manufacturing I guesstimated back then that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was getting as much billion in annual licensing fees from Android device manufacturers Unfortunately Nadella decided to sacrifice these patent fees to induce device makers to preinstall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>mobile apps on their Android products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offered discounts on licensing fees if Android OEMs preinstall its mobile apps like Skype or Outlook on new Android phones and tablets Without the same amount of revenue from licensing fees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has less throwaway money to subsidize the selling of sub Lumia phones I strongly agree with this decision of Nadella Quitting the entrylevel phone business will likely encourage PC manufacturers to support Windows Mobile devices I am still confident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can hit its target of putting Windows on billion devices by end of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced earlier this month that Windows is already running on million devices As traditional PC sales continue its downtrend I expect Acer and other PC vendors to shift their focus to Windows phones and tablet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still offering free Windows and Windows Mobile licenses to manufacturers of devices with inch or smaller displays This deal covers computers tablets and smartphones On this note I am wishing again for an Intelpowered smartphone from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The upcoming Surface phone project should not be powered exclusively by ARMbased processors of Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM I believe that only an x processor can effectively deliver the smartphoneasacomputer concept of Continuum Letting enterprise customers have an Intelpowered Surface phone with full Windows not the watered down Windows Mobile is a killer idea Enterprise users will appreciate being able to run their custom legacy Win apps inside an Intelpowered phone Intels Atom x processor made it possible for a Chinese company to build a pocket computer with a inch touchscreen display and running the full version of Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>only needs to create a phone version of the GOLE allinone computer This feat is something that Apple and Google could never replicate Using a Snapdragon processor will only render the Surface phone as just another rebranding of the Lumia If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is really serious in creating a highend phone for business users it would use the same x processors that made the Surface Pro tablet successful The next highend phones from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ought to have x and ARMbased versions Let the customers decide which one will be most useful to them Disclosure I amwe are long MSFT INTC AAPL GOOG I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions
