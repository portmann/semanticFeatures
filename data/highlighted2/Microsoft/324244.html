years ahead In my past articles I have speculated that Intel NASDAQ INTC would need to put D XPoint XP on the DRAM bus in order for it to be of any real value However I was wrong as is pointed out by a recent Intel patent application Currently to increase the size of system main memory requires multiple DIMMs which increases the cost and volume of the system Increasing the volume of a system adversely affects the form factor of the systemeg large DIMM memory ranks are not ideal in the mobile client space What is needed is an efficient main memory system wherein increasing capacity does not adversely affect the form factor of the host system FIG is a block diagram of a LM system including a main memory portion integrated with a disk storage device In system a device including a nonvolatile second level of memory is also enabled to provide a logically integrated disk storage level In this embodiment system includes main memory comprising near memory and nonvolatile far memory managed by NMC and FMC respectively and disk storage memory System includes moduleslogic to enable partitioning of nonvolatile memory subsystem comprising at least one nonvolatile memory device and control logic such that a portion of that capacity remains allocated to main memory usage ie far memory per the LM systems described above and the remaining capacity is allocated to an integrated storage capability Furthermore it is to be understood that the example embodiment of FIG may provide a cost advantage relative to prior art systems which must provide adequate DRAM capacity in addition to some separate minimal discrete disk storage capability It is further understood that the above described memory partitioning allows for innovative formfactors particularly in mobile client space and dense server space because a minimum functional system according to these embodiments no longer requires any discrete disk support Theres no more speculation required From the horses mouth Intel is replacing a dramatic portion of DRAM requirements with SSDbased XP They also outline how this can be done in a manner that is transparent to the software ie this can be implemented immediately without change to the OS or applications Now we know why Intel has been subsidizing their mobile space with contra revenue they created an Intelbased mobile ecosystem based on the cost of their future products Not that this ecosystem exists they can not release their lowcost XPbased product set and turn those losses into big profits nearly overnight Additionally this system is not only much cheaper than the comparable allDRAM competition it is oodles more powerefficient While this was buried in one of my past articles it is worth repeating Intel patent application With the use of the NVRAM the platform can enter a poweredoff sleep state in response to a request for entry into a powered sleep state The difference in power consumption between the powered sleep state and the poweredoff sleep state can be one or two orders of magnitude On a mobile platform this power saving can translate into a battery life in standby mode from a few days to a few hundreds of days Thus significant power saving can be achieved So while it might be cheaper for Intel to produce I have a feeling that market forces will price these new Intel hybrid memory products with a premium because their powerperformance is going to be so spectacular Intel is going to make a fortune while the rest of the market scrambles to catch up But nobody is even close at this point If I want to search Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL for the term dynamometer I get results in less than half a second This happens so quickly because Google maintains their data in DRAM While this particular query might only see a few queries in a given week Google needs to power this DRAM xx This means that one of Googles largest costs is electricity If Google were to replace the bulk of their DRAM with Intelbased XP systems then their electric bill would be slashed to just a small fraction of the current bill But it gets better Because DRAM needs to be tied to a processor in extremely limited quantities each slice of Googles search database requires an extremely underutilized processor This is not the case for the XPbased systems proposed in the Intel patent application above the processors and memory are abstracted from each other so all processors are free to work with all memory This means that a much smaller number of processors are required in order to traverse the search data when required Intel is going to lose some CPU revenue here but they are going to more than make up for it with world dominance While I have leveraged Google in my example the same principles apply to Facebook NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Apple NASDAQ AAPL and pretty much any other inmemory datacenter provider out there I wouldnt be true to myself if I ended my article without making some wild unfounded prognostication So I will Once this Intel technology reaches market this summer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will release their PConaphone This PC phone will have such amazing power efficiency that it will suddenly make Intels wireless docking technology finally look compelling You need only walk through an airport to realize that cables are necessary because battery life is the biggest shortcoming right now This will not be the case with these new Intel systems At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will finally roll out their own Windows desktop as a service to complement their new PConaphone ecosystem The PC as we know it will disappear never to be seen again apps will flow across devices displays and input devices There will be a tremendous consolidation in the industry because XP production will be capacityconstrained for the foreseeable future Intel and Micron NASDAQ MU will be the first acquired Whos big enough to pull that off I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
