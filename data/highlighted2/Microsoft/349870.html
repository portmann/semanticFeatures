class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Could Back A Yahoo Buyout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is rumored to be interested in contributing funds to a purchase of Yahoo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might go beyond this to a full fledged acquisition of Yahoo Kara Switsher of recode reported yesterday that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT might back or contribute substantially to a buyout of Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Microsofts involvement with a buyout makes perfect sense The subsequent restructuring and ouster of Marissa Mayer would pave the way for a restoration of the exclusive use of Microsofts Bing search engine in Yahoos search Increasing search share for Bing in its battle with Alphabets Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL could well be worth the billions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might pay Prior to Mayer joining Yahoo as the CEO in Yahoo had reached an agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in to use Bing Bing would be used exclusively for algorithmic and paid search services accessed on its and partner web sites by personal computers The agreement would last for years Effectively Yahoo had retired from the search business Mayer was apparently not a big fan of Yahoos decision on search Certainly it seemed to many at the time of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>agreement that Yahoo was hollowing itself out Swisher observed in that Mayer was making a big push to return the company to the search business In attempting to return the company to the search business Yahoo would now be competing with two much stronger companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Google Yahoo also would be competing with its erstwhile search partner To avoid a direct violation of its contract with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Yahoo would pursue search in key areas where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was not promised exclusivity mobile search through apps and contextual search Contextual search which Mayer averred to be very excited by is based on observations of actions that smartphones can make of the user including search history internet site visitation history app usage especially for social media and physical location It amounts to massive spying on the user which recent privacy concerns have cast in a less flattering light Nevertheless it continues to be regarded as an opportunity by marketing and advertising concerns The growth of mobile and its ability to provide an abundance of contextual user information seemed to offer a way around the agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>But there was a more direct route that Mayer pursued which was to renegotiate the agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The renegotiated agreement was disclosed in April in an SEC filing Mayer must be a very tough negotiator The agreement was revised so that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>no longer had exclusive rights to personal computer search for Yahoo and partner sites Microsofts share was reduced to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would receive no revenue for searches that didnt use Bing except for a small server maintenance fee In addition Yahoos share of search revenue for Bing searches rose from to Yahoos recent earnings report for Q and the full year reveals how badly the strategy to circumvent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>backfired While revenue for the year rose modestly yy by to billion traffic acquisition costs ballooned from million in to million Yahoo posted an operating loss for the year of billion mostly due to a goodwill impairment charge of billion Even without the impairment charge Yahoo would have posted a million operating loss mostly due to the higher traffic acquisition costs As of the end of the year Yahoos board announced that it was looking for buyers of its core nonAlibaba NYSE BABA assets Yahoos current market cap of billion is just slightly greater than its end of valuation of Alibaba of billion This valuation is probably too pessimistic and institutional investors sensing a bargain now hold of the company Yahoos yearend financial reports demonstrates very clearly that Yahoo is worth more than the market allows In before the new agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>took effect Yahoo posted an operating profit of million The path to restoring profitability is fairly straightforward Dump Mayer Dump the attempts to develop an independent search capability Return to using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Bing Integrate future mobile and contextual search efforts within the larger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cloud services strategy Rarely in the acquisition of troubled companies such as Yahoo is an opportunity presented such as what currently faces <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can be the salvation of Yahoo Indeed its the only company that can Any other acquirer just gets an empty shell when it comes to search <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would get an empty shell as well but its a shell it can profitably fill Regardless of whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>acquires Yahoo outright or merely participates in a syndicate that acquires Yahoo it can be assured that the role of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in Yahoo search will be restored and with it a reasonable expectation of profitability going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would acquire a still valuable brand and important web destination Synergy is an over used word but there are certainly opportunities for synergies beyond search Yahoo can provide an outlet as well as serve as a customer for Microsofts cloud services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>acquires in Yahoo a web media outlet that can provide an ample advertising platform for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>products and services I consider Microsofts participation in a Yahoo buyout highly likely Probably that buyout will come at a premium above the current share price making Yahoo a buy I continue to rate <span
