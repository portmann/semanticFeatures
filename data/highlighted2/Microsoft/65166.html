fastest growing space in the cloud market makes the company an enticing takeover target Despite its strategic positioning Salesforcecom is simply too expensive to be a realistic takeover target for bidders like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Oracle According to our estimates using a WACC discount rate in a DCF model Salesforcecom is worth about billion and thats what we believe the company is worth to bidders Recently there have been rumors circulating that tech giants like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Oracle NYSE ORCL and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN are interested in a potential takeover of Salesforcecom NYSE CRM Salesforcecom currently trades at roughly a share giving the cloud computing giant a market cap of roughly billion and an enterprise value of billion The stock isnt cheap by any metric trading at x trailing EBITDA and x E earnings which gives it a PEG using the analyst consensus growth rate of While the company has seen revenue grow over the past years Salesforcecom is still unprofitable Why then are tech giants and cashcows like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Oracle looking to acquire an unprofitable expensive yet large tech business like Salesforcecom The answer lies in the cloud In short Salesforcecom is the dominant player in the largest component Customer Relationship Management CRM of the highest growth sector Software as a Service SaaS in the highest growth space Cloud Computing in the tech world going forward The transition from antiquated complex and expensive software and hardware products to the novel largely misunderstood but largely acceptedasthefuture cloud is already occurring and this transition is expected to accelerate over the next five years and further In order to understand why the cloud is expected to dominate the tech market in the near future we must understand what the cloud is and what advantages it holds over traditional software and hardware products The cloud is more or less a central data storage facility as opposed to storing and managing data on data located on your computer you are storing and managing data located at a central data storage facility the cloud and calling it to your computer when needed This scalable architecture offers several advantages to users The huge advantage of the cloud is seen in costs The cloud is a shared infrastructure much similar to a utility You only pay for what you need or use usually via monthly or annual subscriptions and upgrades to cloud services are automatic and applied to all users using the cloud service This is very different to traditional software hardware products where you pay for the whole software or hardware package and have to manually install the updates Moreover the cloud eliminates the need for physical storage or the hiring of an IT team further cutting costs The convenience advantage and space advantage can be explained by one simple sentence the cloud is easy to start use and manage and an entire business can be run from a single computer since the data is stored on the cloud The security advantage is exemplified by the clouds multitenancy architecture The cloud is very similar to a huge commercial building with several tenants users In this sense the clouds multitenancy architecture offers unprecedented scalability and security for stored data Analysts and research groups alike expect computing cloud technology to experience exponential growth over the next five years Goldman Sachs not only expects the cloud computing infrastructure market to be roughly threefold its current size by but also expects cloud computing costs to account for nearly of total enterprise IT spending by up from roughly in Computerworld a business technology publication believes of IT decision makers are planning to increase spending on cloud computing services in Further of IT decision makers at companies with more than employees are planning to increase spending on cloud computing services in This speaks to the scalability and cost advantages of the cloud the larger a company gets the greater the necessity for having consolidated costeffective network of data storage The growth isnt just domestic as evidence by the following forecasts from Ovum By Ovum predicts that over of enterprises globally will be using IaaS Infrastructure as a Service cloud technology Cloud computing infrastructure can be segmented into three services SaaS Software as a Service PaaS Platform as a Service and IaaS Infrastructure as a Service According to Cisco Global Cloud Index SaaS with a CAGR is expected to be the fastest growing service of the cloud CAGR into SaaS can be further segmented into two equal parts The important part here is that CRM Customer Relationship Management services account for of SaaS services CRM comprises all interactions a company has with its consumers including BB business to business and BC business to customer relationships And here is where we see Salesforcecoms ostensible value to bidders like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Oracle Salesforcecom with a market share is the clear frontrunner in the CRM cloud space Using Cisco Global Indexs growth estimates for the SaaS PaaS IaaS and overall cloud sector into we can quantify what Salesforcecoms position as the favored CRM SaaS software company means for the top line of the company compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>who offers PaaS SaaS and IaaS services with its cloud enterprise suite If we assume Salesforce can grow revenues in line with SaaS market expectations CAGR and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can grow its commercial cloud revenues in line with cloud market expectations CAGR we can see that the difference in each companys cloud top line diverge over time with Salesforcecom notching nearly billion more in revenue from cloud services than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>on a trailing twelve month basis These figures force us to recall a recent statement from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>targeting a billion runrate for its commercial cloud by fiscal Looking at the numbers above it just doesnt make sense that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can get to that runrate without acquiring Salesforcecom To better understand this refer to the following chart which is our analysis of what Microsofts commercial cloud segment topline CAGR would have to be in order to reach the targeted billion runrate by fiscal both by itself and with a potential acquisition of Salesforcecom We can see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>without a Salesforcecom acquisition would have to grow its commercial cloud segment at roughly a little less than double the markets expected CAGR to reach a billion runrate by FY we assume baseline billion in FY rev from B B B B in sequential quarter revenue With a Salesforcecom acquisition however that CAGR drops to below the markets CAGR This highly suggests that the only way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reaches its billion runrate target by FY is through an acquisition of Salesforcecom All these qualitative and quantitative reasons are why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and others would make a bid for Salesforcecom and the type of value a Salesforcecom acquisition could add to the top line of these companies over the next few years But is the pricetag on Salesforcecom worth it In MAs the bidder pays premium for shares of the company being bought out Merrill Lynch thinks Salesforcecom shares could sell for as much as while Credit Suisse values Salesforcecoms takeover value between and per share Our analysis leads us to believe that Salesforcecoms fair takeover value could be roughly per share but we believe the assumptions that lead us to this takeover value are unreasonable More reasonable assumptions lead us to believe Salesforcecom shares are worth only about to bidders valuing the company at roughly billion We get to our takeover value based on a year DCF analysis using a WACC discount rate We find Salesforcecoms WACC to be using the following math To get to an takeover value we assumed that Salesforcecom grows revenues at a CAGR into in line with the SaaS market and benefits from some operating costsaving synergies from a merger with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which should be effective immediately Our work can be shown in the following figure We do not believe however that a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>merger will ensure a topline CAGR of for Salesforcecom and thus do not believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should pay billion for Salesforcecom a premium on current market value A merger will imply some costsaving synergies but that is exactly where the synergies end and become desynergies Companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Oracle dont mesh with companies like Salesforcecom Big and old companies dont mesh well with small and new companies in the tech industry cultures clash business values are devalued and the core of what made Salesforcecom successful is quickly lost in the MA shuffle And there arent enough costsaving synergies for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Oracle to break even on the EPS dilution from paying billion for an unprofitable business We do however recognize that there is some substantial value in adding the industry leading CRM SaaS provider for companies like Oracle and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>who are looking to expand and grow their cloud businesses to stay relevant as their hardware and software businesses slowly bleed out So how much is Salesforcecom worth to these bidders We believe that Salesforcecom can grow revenues in line with cloudmarket CAGR but not at a rate higher than that Salesforcecom already has deep penetration into the cloud space specifically the CRM SaaS space Salesforcecom should also see slowed topline growth due to increase competition from deeperpocketed competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Oracle As detailer earlier a merger while providing costsaving synergies risks personnel cohesion and culture problems which could adversely impact topline growth These assumptions can be represented in the following figure where we show our steps leading to a per share takeover value for Salesforcecom Our suggestion to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Oracle Amazon and others interested in a bid for Salesforcecom its not worth anything north of billion None of these companies could get an earnings yield that justifies for paying a premium on billion Our DCF analysis indicates Salesforcecom is worth about billion and that is about what the company is worth to bidders like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Oracle Source Why Salesforcecom Is Only Worth About Billion To Bidders Disclosure The author is long MSFT
