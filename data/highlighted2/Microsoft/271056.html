especially in the telecommunications sector Recently IBM announced that it is taking the charge of ATTs cloud business IBM has built a robust cloud and big data ecosystem which could limit even Intels data center growth In a recent development IBM NYSE IBM is taking the charge of ATTs NYSE T cloud based managed hosting and application services business The assets associated with the services will be included in IBMs cloud portfolio This is in line with IBMs telecom strategy Philip Guido IBM General Manager of Global Technology Services for North America said Todays announcement represents an expansion of our strategic relationship with ATT and continuing collaboration to deliver new innovative solutions Working with ATT we will deliver a robust set of IBM Cloud and managed services that can continuously evolve to meet clients business objectives Telecom operators are expanding their focus on cloud analytics and mobility like never before For IBM this is a tremendous growth opportunity with its solution labs research labs and innovation centers In this article I will dig deeper in IBMs telecom business Why ATT Is Transferring Facilities And Hosting Divisions IBM will acquire ATTs equipment and access its data centers where the equipment are installed ATT like many other big telcos is offloading some of its noncore assets for paying off debt and raising funds for investments This is a new trend traditional telecom operators are following The telecom industry is witnessing a host of challenges such as competitive pressure mature markets adapting to rapid technological changes and proliferation of product offerings To cope with the situation major operators are restructuring their business by bringing a meaningful shift in their operations The shift primarily involves sharing similar tasks and selling data centers This is what ATT is also doing Lets first focus on IBMs telecom strategy IBM is targeting the CSPs communication service providers such as telecom operators cable service providers satellite broadcasting operators content and applications service providers and cloud service providers to help them generate revenue from the big data value chain Internal telecom data combined with thirdparty data has tremendous potential that CSPs can exploit to drive their revenues with the help of advanced analytics Thirdparty data include data from various social media like Facebook NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR As I said above the challenges telcos are facing today are resulting in softer revenue growth and decreasing profit margin The only way to boost revenue growth and profit margin is adopting businessfocused big data initiatives Well what is a businessfocused big data initiative The answer is building customer focus and improving operational efficiencies for expanding revenue and profitability via prudent use of big data analytics and other solutions However directly selling customer data to third parties such as private companies and government agencies is risky due to privacy issues IBMs analytics solutions like Watson Analytics help telecom operators generate richer insights from internal and thirdparty data and develop new capabilities and business models leveraging the data IBMs cloudbased services and APIs help telcos offer customers analyticsasaservice This is a nascent business opportunity with meaningful revenue growth potential for telcos I would recommend investors to watch this video to better understand how big data analytics can boost revenue of communication service providers as well as establish new revenue streams In addition to Watson Analytics IBMs solution for Hadoop also helps telcos extract insights from the wealth of data they are sitting on The solution which uses Linuxbased IBM Power server is a reference architecture that offers CSPs a robust infrastructure for their big data workload The xbased servers powered by Intels NASDAQ INTC Xeon EE processor families offer telcos reliable solutions to meet the challenges they face For example Oracles NYSE ORCL xbased servers are widely used in the telecom industry The company has stable customerbase in business analytics for big data Earlier this year Oracle introduced its new application server for CSPs which supports NFV network functions virtualization and SDN softwaredefined networks enabled networks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT also offers a host of big data services via its Azure cloud platform Although business intelligence including analytics and Hadoop running on Intels xbased processors is the defacto standard for telcos today IBMs big data solutions are fast displacing this industry standard Realizing this Intel and Oracle teamed up recently against IBM to drive customers away from IBMs Power Systems toward Oracles Engineered Systems Major telcos like ATT and Verizon NYSE VZ are performing well on sourcing and analyzing data on x platform But as far as acting on the analysis is concerned such as developing new capabilities and business models IBMs solutions are capable of offering superior outcomes The advantage of IBMs solutions lies in the following two factors Since IBMs Watson Analytics supports natural language it saves time with less daunting learning curve As a result its capable of delivering superior outcomes Telcos can customize IBMs Solution for Hadoop specifically to meet their workloads by selecting the optimal combination of CPU and storage which isnt possible on the traditional xbased infrastructure In addition to the above points IBMs fullblown ecosystem covering hardware software and mobility makes it the most versatile big data solutions provider IBMs Power servers are fast emerging as the most sought after servers for businesses that use IBMs big data solutions because of the ecosystem advantage Power servers use the Power chip with up to cores per socket The SMT technology helps the chip support threads per core which is four times than what Intel can offer For running big data workloads the Power architecture is more suitable for telecom operators These are the reasons why ATT has chosen IBM for managing its cloud based hosting and application services business Intels networking venture jointly with its partners like Oracle will result in significant revenue growth for its data center business Intels data center revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of in the next three to five years with its strong reference architecture I shared my views about Intels reference architecture in another article However with IBM appearing in the scenario Intels competitive advantage in the data center business may not rise significantly going forward I believe longterm investors focusing on cloud and big data should own the shares of both IBM and Intel We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to
