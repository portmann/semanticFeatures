class='textDiv'>Virtual Reality The Next Disruptive Technology Seeking Alpha Virtual and augmented reality represent one of the next major disruptive innovations The applications are nearly endless and range from video gaming and electronic entertainment to healthcare and military applications The two major inhibitors are hardwaresoftware prices and the general lack of impactful software and content A few solid investment choices in the VRAR space include Nvidia Corporation Intel Corporation and Micron Technologies The internet smartphones social media and ridesharing are all examples of disruptive innovation Virtual and Augmented Reality VRAR is on the cusp of being added to this list and you should be taking advantage of the opportunity In the next handful of years as technology improves costs come down and user adoption increases VRAR will sweep the world as the next major technological disruption The applications for VRAR are literally endless from the obvious uses involving video gaming and electronic entertainment to the notsoobvious uses like retail real estate and healthcare In almost every industry imaginable there will be some commercial or consumer use for VRAR applications Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research group composed an equity study which estimated the VRAR industry will generate a basecase of billion in revenues by billion bullcase and billion bearcase The RD is certainly present and growing with names such as Oculus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT HoloLens HTC Vive Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Glasses and many others Over the past couple of years there have been over venture capital investments in VRAR raising over billion In the past the primary holdback to user adoption has been the steep price points and clunky design However with time these drawbacks will diminish this will represent the turning point when VRAR sales gain traction The Goldman Sachs study compares VRAR adoption to that of smartphones and tablets albeit more conservatively I picture a world where a simple pair of glasses entirely replaces a smartphone a surgeon is able to practice a virtual surgery based on real images or a group of students come together and interact with each other despite being hundreds of miles apart This is the level of disruption I am talking about truly life altering While I believe the adoption of VRAR is an eventual certainty the lingering risk is that the timehorizon is unknown which could result in subpar annualized returns For this reason I recommend investing in solid companies throughout the VRAR supplychain rather than manufacturers or distributors of the VRAR devices themselves This serves to hedge against many of the direct risks associated with VRAR adoption by exposing investors to the rest of the companys business you still get VRAR upside without all of the downside risk Another hurdle VRAR must overcome is the largescale development of compatible software within certain industries The requirement for good software and content exposes a bit of a catch consumers do not want to purchase VRAR hardware without a strong app and content library while software developers do not want to invest resources into content production without an established user base Regardless I think this issue will resolve itself once the technology becomes affordable Initial adopters will create a demand for content which will snowball adoption to the masses One final inhibitor to VRAR adoption are current hardware prices For many interested users spending hundreds of dollars for the unit and then hundreds more for necessary cameras games or computing equipment is not feasible However I expect VRAR prices to decline as the technology improves Goldman Sachs estimates that this costtrajectory will mimic the costcurve of other similar technologies such as tablets and smartphones At some point in the near future these devices and associated hardwaresoftware will be affordable enough for the everyday user There are a number of ways to invest in a future where VRAR is integrated into everyday lives As I mentioned I would recommend taking a position somewhere along the VRAR supply chain delivering upside potential while limiting downside risk The first investment I would recommend is Nvidia Corporation NASDAQ NVDA Nvidia is a diverse semiconductor company specializing in graphics processing units while also manufacturing system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets I outlined the bull case for Nvidia through a DCF and fundamental analysis a few weeks ago and still emphasize their incredibly strong position once VRAR comes online In short VRAR devices require extremely intensive graphics performance Nvidia has positioned itself as a leader in this market and will leverage current relationships to develop strong sales and partnerships moving forward Not only do VRAR applications require extreme graphics but also put systems under intense processing loads Another diversified investment I would recommend is with Intel NASDAQ INTC Intel specializes in manufacturing processors with one centerpiece being the CORE series Once again Intel is a market leader in CPUs and will be an excellent way to capture exploding VRAR sales In fact the Oculus Rift lists the NVIDIA GTX graphics card and the Intel i CPU under its required system specifications Another potential VRAR play is with Micron Technology NASDAQ MU Micron is a leader in memory and semiconductor technology and fits nicely into the VRAR supply chain as a provider of memory and drive hardware for the nextgen units As with the GPUs and CPUs required for VRAR technology topnotch memory and SSD devices will also be required Micron certainly fits the bill here Since this piece is meant to be more of an introductory primer into the VRAR space I did not want to dive too deeply into the particular companies I recommended However I plan on dedicating entire future articles to some of these firms and how they are preparing for future VRAR business I see this as a pivotal and disruptive moment those poised to capture the change will succeed while the rest will falter While there is still some level of uncertainty surrounding the VRAR marketplace and its rate of adoption I do believe that it will be entirely disruptive once it takes hold I strongly recommend investing in a couple of companies which will leverage this disruptive technology while avoiding much of the downside risk in the event of delayed adoption Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in NVDA over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology
