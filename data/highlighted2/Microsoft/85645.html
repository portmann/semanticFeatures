NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha MSFT announces partnership with FBs Oculus Rift for virtual reality gaming starting in Q Partnership will include Xbox One game streaming Windows gaming integration on Oculus VR headset along with Xbox One controllers with every Rift purchase Meant to compete with Sonys Project Morpheus but minimizing investment risk enables MSFT to work on ecosystem integration instead Only downside Q misses holiday season Investing will revolve around MSFT and FB into the second half of The weeks leading up to the E expo bring numerous rumors from the video game industry regarding product launches new hardware and main industry players setting themselves up for the second half of and beyond While this year is expected to focus on upgrades to console systems and gaming franchises from independent and AAA developers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT got things started with a bang by announcing a partnership with Facebookbacked NASDAQ FB Oculus to bring virtual reality gaming to the Xbox One and new Windows operating system giving the console developer an early jump on rival Sony NYSE SNE and its own VR headset Set to hit the shelves during the first quarter of the latest incarnation of the Oculus Rift will be sold with an Xbox One game controller as a package deal which will enable the headset to work with streaming Xbox One games and on Windows compatible PCs and tablets an operating system that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been pushing consumers to install Games also will be available on the Rift system as well and Oculus announced nearly million in incentives for independent developers to create games on this new system which would provide consumers with what would hopefully be a strong initial library of streamed Microsoftcompatible games and ones designed specifically for Oculus virtual reality interface With the inclusion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a main gaming partner analysts predict that both companies can feed off each other as video game development moves away from consoles and into the realm of virtual and augmented reality Oculus Rift wont be the only virtual reality helmet on offer though Sony Microsofts main rival in the video game space announced that it would be releasing its own virtual reality headset Project Morpheus in the first half of as well and will likely include access to Sonys much touted video game library a main advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in this current generation of consoles However Sonys machine is financed and serviced by the company itself which makes it a risky investment for what many are considering to be the new frontier of gaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>on the other hand went out and partnered with a company that has its own deeppocketed backer in Facebook which means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can devote its time to being a content partner and a game streamer By enabling Oculus games to be played with a familiar console controller to many gamers as well as access to a library of popular titles within the Xbox ecosystem Oculus Rift can enable gamers to experiment with new technology while keeping one foot in their comfort zone making it more accessible to gamers than Project Morpheus on those grounds alone For its part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can focus its attention on consolidating its gaming enterprises for Xbox and Windows creating an ecosystem similar to the one enjoyed by Apple or Samsung If the reality of Oculus Rift and virtual reality gaming lives up to the expectations the state of the video game industry as we know it will be dramatically different But what does this mean for investors While Microsofts video game division isnt as important to the companys fortunes as the PlayStation is to Sony the combination of virtual reality gaming along with the integration of the Xbox and Windows ecosystems could flip the script on the console wars which has been in Sonys favor for the past two years Unfortunately the release is happening in Q rather than the holidaybacked shopping season of Q reducing the potential initial success of the new system However it could give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a chance to get ahead of the game during an otherwise quiet time for the industry and the vaguer timeframe for the soontobe rival Project Morpheus This would make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Facebook both longterm plays with the bigger upside coming in the second half of which would be Oculus first holiday season and would give the system another round at E to woo the gaming public Facebook likely stands to gain more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as Oculus Rifts main benefactor and will feature more prominently in the eyes of the companys shareholders but both companies will rise or fall together depending on whether or not virtual reality is the future of gaming or just another fad E hasnt started yet but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is already off to a good start with this preconvention announcement It will be interesting to see what the company says during its press conference on June as well as Sonys rebuttal Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Scores First As Gaming World Shifts Attention
