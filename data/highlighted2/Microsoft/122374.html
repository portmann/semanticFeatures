technology giant Apple NASDAQ AAPL reporting its earnings Tuesday after the bell The company is expected to report another quarterly revenue record on the heels of continued strength of the iPhone This quarter an interesting theme has developed with many of the key numbers involving a Today Ill detail how this is the case and how Apple must overcome very high quarterly expectations The iPhone is obviously the key to Apples quarter with my model calling for the smartphone to bring in more than of fiscal Q revenues In the first two quarters of the fiscal year the company reported and unit sales growth for the device Thanks to continued problems at Samsung OTC SSNLF Apple is expected to keep up its strong growth A increase over last years period would put this quarters number at about million Many expectations are for a to be the first print for unit sales In fact fellow SA writer Mark Hibben believes that Apples will report its best fiscal quarterly growth rate this year more than growth to million sales I think thats a little optimistic as there was a report about Apple raising product prices around the globe due to the stronger dollar Fiscal Q will be the first full quarter where those higher prices would be felt which I think could hurt demand a little I think a reasonable expectation is a quarterly growth rate of halfway between Q and Q which gives us million iPhone sales for the quarter The second key revolves around the Mac line as IDC has estimated Apple had more than yearoveryear shipment growth to million units This would put Apple in fourth place for global shipments a tremendous feat given the drop IDC estimated for Q Apple needs to ship more units in the quarter to top million but Gartner didnt even have Apple in its global top implying less than million units Apple will have a sizable market share gain but even growth of nearly to say million units or so would be impressive With the PC market showing a huge Q decline ahead of the Windows launch I just dont see Apple matching its or Mac unit growth rates from Q and Q respectively The third comes in relation to the Apple Watch the newest product which has received a lot of negative comments lately While Slice Intelligence did report a large drop in US sales as the fiscal quarter continued the firms estimates still had Apple at about million US units or so for the quarter I think it is reasonable to believe Apple could sell million units exUS in the quarter especially with some late quarterly sales from the second round of countries getting the device That would give us a total of million although Apple management has said it will be tightlipped about sales of this device early on If we do get financial data on the Watch it will be interesting to see if the device has an average selling price of and brings in of Apples quarterly revenues When adding all of my above numbers plus about million iPad sales I get a total quarterly revenue figure just below billion This is a bit above the analyst average but there are a fair number of those expecting a print higher than billion For shares to see a new alltime high the top line number probably needs a print The final comes in relation to Apples buyback When management raised the amount to billion earlier this year the program had billion left for eight quarters Thats an average of billion per quarter Apples daily fiscal Q closing price was about so an average buyback would mean around million shares How does management feel about its share price The number of shares purchased for the quarter will tell us A number in the low million or less probably means management is saving some powder for a pullback while a number above a print would say shares are undervalued When it comes to current expectations analysts are expecting billion in revenues and in EPS compared to billion and in the prior year period The street is well above the companys guidance range for billion to billion for the quarter When Apple gave that forecast for the quarter the average revenue estimate was billion That number has risen more than billion since seen below Analysts are now more than billion over the top of Apples range Since Apple detailed it would be giving more realistic guidance weve never seen expectations this high As seen below this is the most bullish analysts have been going into a report since Apples guidance mindset changed The analyst estimate figure is from the day that Apple reported the respective quarter with the fiscal Q number being as of Monday doesnt seem like much but it is when compared to the prior two quarters under and the rest under the top end of Apples guidance Its not just that Apple estimates are at an alltime high but Apple also is the only company seeing this kind of optimism The table below shows a comparison of estimates for tech giants and their respective calendar Q quarters since their last reports Intel NASDAQ INTC beat lowered estimates but the EPS beat was due to a onetime tax rate benefit Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL beat reduced EPS estimates but still missed on revenues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and IBM NYSE IBM have seen both of their estimates come down while Cisco NASDAQ CSCO has seen a slight revenue rise Apple is the only name where estimates on both the top and bottom line have increased significantly between reports When it comes to fiscal Q the magic numbers all seem to revolve around five Theres a lot of optimism regarding Q for Apple but comparisons start to get tougher in the current quarter Analysts are expecting billion in revenues for Q a nearly billion sequential rise With two months until the next set of iPhones are available guidance will show what management thinks of potential sales for new products and services Fiscal Q is the last quarter where the company has a shot to show decent revenue and earnings growth December ending Q is where sales comparisons from the iPhone start to get really tough Apple faces its highest bar ever with analysts expecting the company to come in well above its quarterly guidance A strong earnings report Tuesday could send the stock to a new alltime high Im looking for billion in revenues and in EPS so lets see if Apple delivers Source Apple Is The Magic Number Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
