still a noshow This delay has forced Intels partner Asustek to reduce its order of x phone processors this year The smartphone is still important toward the longterm viability of x processors Aicha Evans head of Intels NASDAQ INTC troubled mobile phone division is reportedly quitting Her replacement must prioritize x processors with builtin GLTE modems Failure to do so only worsens Intels smartphone processor business Intels struggle on smartphones is due to its failure to adopt fast enough to changing trends Due to the aggressive rollout of LTE networks by carriers there are now more than billion G mobile connections By G is expected to account for a third of the estimated billion mobile broadband connections Telecom firms which spent billions of dollars on their LTE network infrastructure also are spending big money on advertising their fastercheaper mobile broadband services The informed mobile users are therefore rallying around the big shift toward Gonly phones The superior uploaddownload speed of G connectivity is a must among mobile users accustomed to Netflix NASDAQ NFLX streaming and hourslong YouTube sessions Intels processor designs should quickly adjust toward favoring GLTEcompatible phone models Very few tierone phone manufacturers will bet on outdated Gonly Atom x SoFIA processors An allinone SystemonChip like the LTE Cat The equipped Snapdragon from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM is certainly more attractive than the current generation Gonly Intel Atom x MediaTek also has cheap octacore Gcompatible processors that dominate Chinasourced entrylevel Android phones Without an offer of substantial subsidiesdiscounts Intels Gonly Atom xC and xCXRK are endangered species Kitguru reported last year that Intel would release the midrange Atom xCX SystemonChip SoC with integrated GLTE baseband feature early in However the first quarter of this year is over and this G SoC is still a noshow Intel also has remained mum over the updatesdevelopment of the Atom xCX This lack of communication from Intel is a big letdown for manufacturers Its no surprise that Asustek OTCASUUY Intels biggest client for Atom phone processors will reduce its exposure to x phone SoCs Not meeting the requirements of its biggest phone partner only discourages other tierone phone vendors from experimenting with x phone SoCs Due to the tardiness of Intel Qualcomm and MediaTek will instead get more orders from Asustek this year This is a very disappointing development Asustek shipped out million smartphones last year of them had Intel CPUs and modems Asustek now plans to use Intelmade processors only on of the million phones it expects to ship out this year The blame is entirely on Intel It has failed to keep up with the processor designs of its rivals The lack of a costeffective Gcompatible Atom processor product definitely compelled Asustek to source out more of its processor needs from QualcommMediaTek Evans replacement needs to be more aggressive in prodding Intels chip designers to catch up with their peers over at QualcommMediaTek It is not enough for Intel to create Atom processors that can match the energyefficiency and pricing of ARMbased mobile processors The next big hurdle now is for Intel to demonstrate it can create a competent GLTE modemequipped smartphone SoC On a brighter note Intels smartphone campaign is in no danger of dying anytime soon Asustek is still expected to order million Atom x processors for its phones this year However the delay or uncertainty over the eventual release of GLTEequipped Atom processors still needs to be addressed as soon as possible Intel needs to make a firm announcement that it is still committed to building better smartphone processors Intel cannot give up its fight for smartphones I believe that aside from tablets and in notebooks the smartphone industry still offers a worthy expansion area for Intelmade processors The smartphone is the next evolution of office and home computing I expect the eventual fusion of smartphones and personal computers This fusion already is here with the upcoming release of HPs NYSE HPQ Elite X smartphonelaptop computer product However the Elite X is still an incomplete implementation of the smartphonelaptop concept Due to its ARMbased Snapdragon processor the HP Elite X cannot run full desktop versions of Excel or Photoshop I look forward to Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT eventually coming up with a smartphone that runs the real full version of Windows not the watereddown mobile version Unlike ARMbased SoCs Intels x processor can run all the popular enterpriseproductivityfocused operating systems and their corresponding industrystandard software Microsofts Continuum for Phones concept can never achieve its full potential without Intels x processor Disclosure I amwe are long INTC QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
