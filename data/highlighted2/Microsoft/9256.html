an expanded relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for offering customers Polycom RoundTable RoundTable a Skypebased videoconferencing tool will boost Polycoms revenue significantly in the growing videoconferencing market Polycom NASDAQ PLCM said it has expanded its relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and will start delivering a new series of videoconferencing solutions for Skype The development known as the Polycom RoundTable is expected to help Polycom boost revenue significantly The first device in the RoundTable series the Polycom RoundTable will help small to midsized businesses expand their videoconferencing capabilities Leveraging Microsofts Skype platform Polycom is looking to expand its customer base and product portfolio Currently Cisco NASDAQ CSCO dominates the corporate video conferencing market with its Cisco TelePresence Systems CTS Polycom is not targeting the whole corporate sector including large corporations in the initial stage Instead it is targeting the SMBs small to midsized businesses to popularize the platform with Skypes existing userbase in SMBs However we believe Polycom RoundTable will gradually become CTS chief competitor Cisco offers a live and facetoface videoconferencing experience via CTS However the drawback of implementing CTS is that it requires advanced knowledge of the latest networking technologies Skype on the contrary is easy to use and hugely popular in SMBs We believe Microsofts endeavor will be to transform Polycom RoundTable to a userfriendly and affordable videoconferencing solution by combining it with Skype for Business and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Lync The Polycom CX series will also be a part of the Polycom RoundTable which is expected to bring more than million meeting rooms under the umbrella of Polycom and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Polycom RoundTable will see fierce competition from Cisco which introduced Cisco TelePresence back in Cisco has vast experience in developing online videoconferencing solutions In Cisco acquired WebEx and began offering a variety of Unified Communications products to its clients In Cisco acquired Tandberg which positioned Cisco to offer industryleading videoconferencing products The Tandberg content server helps organizations access ondemand video presentations corporate training sessions and distance education classes which are essential parts of the whole videoconferencing experience these days We believe if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>acquires Sonic Foundry NASDAQ SOFO the Polycom RoundTable experience could get even better and more competitive Sonic Foundrys cloudbased Mediasite would be able to make RoundTable more interactive Further with Mediasite past videoconferencing sessions would be searchable Polycoms fullyear revenue was billion and currently its EBITDA margin remains at According to a new report the global market for videoconferencing equipment and services is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of between and With Polycom RoundTable continuing to evolve we believe Polycoms revenue will grow at a CAGR of at least At this run rate the companys fullyear revenue will be around billion and EBITDA will be million We believe Polycom will enjoy an EVEBITDA multiple of around x the multiple at which it trades on an average Applying the multiple on the EBITDA we get its enterprise value of billion which translates into a share price of with net cash of million on the balance sheet and million shares outstanding The share price represents an upside of from the current price level around Polycoms fourth quarter revenue grew satisfactorily across all product lines except the UC platform With its RealPresence platform gaining traction and RoundTable platform continuing to evolve we believe Polycoms future is bright in the growing
