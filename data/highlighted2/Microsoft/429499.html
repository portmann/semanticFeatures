fell YY In addition to containing a lot of fairly standard specs for a highend Android phone a K OLED display a highquality camera MP for the Moto Z MP for the Z Force a metal body and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM flagship Snapdragon processor the Moto Z and Z Force support Moto Mods a set of snapon accessories such as a pico projector a JBL speaker with a kickstand and battery an external battery and a camera module with an optical zoom lens The concept has quite a lot in common with Googles Ara modular phone project In each case the goal is to create optional features that wouldnt find their way into a standard highvolume smartphone but which appeals to one niche or another as well as features a user might only want on a phone some of the time Also launched by Lenovo The Phab Pro a phone that with the help of a wideangle camera and depthsensing unit supports Googles Tango technology which can track objects map a users surroundings and project virtual effects onto realworld environments

largescale gigabit fiber access and other technologies for which the payoff could be many years down the line As for whether a viable flying car will arrive soon its best not to hold your breath But as Bloomberg observes autonomous navigation could eventually address many of the safety and trafficcontrol questions surrounding the technology Former NASA aircraft engineer Mark Moore notes Selfflying aircraft is so much easier than what the auto companies are trying to do with selfdriving cars LinkedIn Qorvo and Pandora get upgraded Qualcomm Skyworks and Skullcandy get downgraded
