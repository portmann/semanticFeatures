trouble cramming more of them into processors Most geeks and engineers have probably heard of Moores Law the phenomenon observed by Intel Corp NASDAQ INTC cofounder Gordon Moore and first documented in a article in the journal Electronics that indicated the performance of microprocessors and other complex integrated circuits would double every year or so for at least the next decade based upon innovation including the number of transistors a smaller scale semiconductor element that can be placed inside such devices In Moore revised his thinking a bit and predicted that performance including such characteristics as speed and power consumption would improve once every two years The ability to cram more transistors into chips driven by continuous improvement and innovation in physics materials engineering and manufacturing allows consumer device manufacturers such as Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL to develop products that are smaller use less power operate faster and cost less There would be no smartphones and many other gadgets without the applicability of Moores Law However advances in chip development have slowed recently and the trend is toward a longer doubling period according to many industry experts In the future chips may not be quite so fast could use more power and cost more This possibility has spawned parallel efforts by chip makers such as Intel and technology giants like IBM NYSE IBM to reverse the trend Every year Apple releases a new smartphone that usually has modest performance gains One year it might be a faster application processor the next a better camera or more pixels in the display Sometimes there is incremental battery capacity improvement A device with more significant advances such as the Plus sized iPhone released last year comes out every two years The company has been able to do this in part because its suppliers have been able to cram more transistors into the Aseries processors and communication and memory chips The upward trend in doubling time might partly explain why many analysts and investors especially those with detailed knowledge of the technology have indicated that Apple is losing its mojo and not innovating as much While probably not a completely accurate observation Apple still has its mojo and then some investors and Apple fanboys should take this into consideration when considering the purchase of the stock or its products As the breakneck innovation in chip technology slows the equally breakneck innovation in smartphones especially by Apple might also have to pause a bit in order to conform to Moores Law Intel the worlds leading maker of processors although not the one used in the iPhone does not have the benefit of Gordon Moores vision anymore He retired several years ago but still manages to speak at technology conferences including on the subject of his law The company is struggling on many fronts mostly because of declining PC shipments that are affecting its bottom line Intel is not a big player in the mobile device industry at all Perhaps a strategic mistake Maybe more importantly in the big scheme of things Intel is having difficulty putting more transistors inside its newer processors One of the reasons is a physical limitation in making eversmaller semiconductors out of silicon The company will need to step up its efforts in that regard if it intends to return to the glory days of one to two year doubling times IBM has long been on the forefront of technology Big Blue developed marketed and licensed PCs running on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Windows starting in the early s and was responsible for a lot of the success of the digital revolution Needless to say the company changed society for the better because of its innovation all those years ago Now the company has a chance to do it all again One of its less wellknown research initiatives the possible use of carbon nanotubes to shrink transistor size and allow more to be placed inside chips than today is urgently needed to reverse the trends in Moores Law At the same time maybe this will jumpstart growth for the company itself Over the past few years investors have been rewarded with a precipitous decline in the stock price mostly caused by stagnant revenue growth Earnings per share have only been increasing because of a stock buyback program which has been praised by Warren Buffett who owns a lot of IBM shares but it can only go so far in returning value to shareholders Chip performance doubling time an important factor in the digital revolution is increasing This could be hurting innovation in some industries like smartphones and might explain why Apple is losing its mojo according to some observers Investors should take a vested
