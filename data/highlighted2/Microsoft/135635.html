season and the battle continues Last week we had a number of big names report some good some bad and some just plain ugly And there are another companies in the SP scheduled to report this week Apple NASDAQ AAPL was one of the big disappointments of last week I surprised many of my clients by selling Apple shares a couple of weeks ago Apples stock had been moving sideways since February and with the Apple Watch receiving a lessthanenthusiastic response in the marketplace and a few other catalysts this was not sizing up to be a blowout quarter That was indeed the case Apple did beat earnings and revenue expectations on strong iPhone sales but its forward guidance was below what analysts had been modeling Given that the stock had run up ahead of the quarter the fallout was all the greater with the stock trading down on the results AAPL looks like dead money until it hits another home run Big Blue IBM NYSE IBM reported dismal earnings If Apple doesnt watch out it risks turning into another IBM In fact there was not a lot to rave about with among the big tech names with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT also posting disappointing results Now for the good Amazon NASDAQ AMZN crushed its earnings expectations It is a name I continue to own And one area of the market delivering very strong results has been in credit card financials Both MasterCard NYSE MA and Visa NYSE V reported excellent earnings and were rewarded accordingly I own both names And finally a name I own but wish I didnt last week The ugliest story of last week was Biogen NASDAQ BIIB The stock was hit by a perfect storm of slower earnings growth disappointing guidance and pipeline problems The stock traded down more than and the analyst darling stock received a slew of downgrades Worries about weakening global growth are also weighing on the market this earnings season Greece may be on the back burner but China continues to selloff as concerns about a hardlanding there persist And Latin America has gone from bad to ugly One of the best indicators of global growth is commodity prices and they continue to selloff hard Look at the massive selloff they have experienced this month So US stock market returns remain muted this year thanks to mixed earnings results and concerns about slow global growth All of this is not helped by the overhang of a potential Fed rate increase Leadership in the market is still very narrow with Banks Healthcare Biotech Pharma Internet and the Consumer stocks offering the best opportunities according to the Best Stocks Now app I have been BULLISH on the market since March I remain BULLISH on the market Here is why As long as earnings of the SP continue to grow so will the market SP earnings bottomed out at per share way back in The SP also bottomed out at around SP earnings have been growing ever since And the market has also been going up ever since My projections for SP earnings currently stand at about per share Earnings will have doubled since the lows while the market has tripled Those earnings per share this year compare with last year The small increase in earnings this year is the main reason the market is only up about this year This has been caused by a big drop off in the earnings of the energy sector and a very strong dollar that has hurt the multinationals I currently have a projection of about per share for At X earnings the SP has the potential to hit over the next twelve months You can also add in dividends to this number More importantly the upwards trend of earnings for the SP is still intact that began back in Now look ahead to this weeks basket of earnings to see what looks good bad and ugly and what it all means for the market as a whole Source Earnings Season
