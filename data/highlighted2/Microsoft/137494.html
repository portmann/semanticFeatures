sheet weakened a little over past year Managements decision on buyback is crucial for dividend Next month I am expecting technology giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to announce its annual dividend raise Last year the company did exactly what I expected raising its dividend to per quarter The company has more than doubled its dividend since as seen in the chart below Today Ill look at Microsofts key financial data and provide my prediction for this years dividend raise The year provided is for the majority of payments so the value represents the payments coming in According to Microsofts dividend history the first payment in fiscal was before being raised to for the final three payments The chart above uses the figure for fiscal When determining any potential dividend raise a review of the companys balance sheet is definitely needed In the table below Ive detailed some key numbers over the past year taken from the companys most recent K filing Dollar values are in millions The domestic held value is the amount of cash located inside the US which is total cash minus cash held by foreign subsidiaries that would be subject to material repatriation tax effects if brought home <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>ended its fiscal Q with a very low domestic cash balance However the company does produce a lot of cash quarterly and can obviously issue debt if it needs to The two key items Im focused on are the decline in the net cash balance and the rise in the debt ratio This reduces the companys financial flexibility a little which could have a negative impact on this years potential dividend raise The second item to think about is the companys buyback which can have both positive and negative effects on the dividend During the fiscal period ending June th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bought back more than billion worth of shares That was more than the billion spent in the prior two years combined The company did take on a bit of debt to accomplish this program taking advantage of lower rates earlier this year Also when the stock pulled back early in the company stepped in and bought a large chunk of shares A little more than of repurchased shares were bought in the second half of the fiscal year This year the company has already stated on its Q conference call that the stronger dollar will negatively impact results Also the stock is back near just a few dollars away from its week high When you combine this with the expectation that interest rates will rise in the next few months Im not sure the company will borrow as much to repurchase shares I would expect a more normal level of buybacks as opposed to the big year we just saw On one hand less share repurchases could free up more money for the dividend On the other hand the share count doesnt come down as fast which negatively impacts the dividend So what could a potential raise look like Well last years raise was cents per quarter Given the slightly weaker balance sheet plus currency issues I think that would be the largest raise we would see Since the company probably wants to go with whole cents for its dividend its possible to see a step down to a cent raise In the table below Ive modeled what a potential raise could look like based on quartercent increments The yellow range is the to per quarter area where I think the new dividend will land Given what Ive presented above I would go with a cent raise if I was deciding on the dividend With the uncertainty around the Windows launch and its impact on the PC space Id rather the company take a more conservative approach at this time In the chart below Ive compared where Microsofts current and potentially raised dividend compares against the following tech peers as of Fridays close Intel NASDAQ INTC Apple NASDAQ AAPL Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and IBM NYSE IBM The other five names average about currently which would basically be where Microsofts annual yield would be with a quarterly dividend based on current stock prices In the end I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors would be more than satisfied with a roughly dividend raise which would put the annual yield just below that of a Year US treasury bond <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a cash generating machine currently and even despite some balance sheet weakness next month should see a dividend raise Source <span
