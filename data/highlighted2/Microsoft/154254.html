its rivals Microsofts Xbox One and Nintendos Wii U The Wii U will continue to languish as rumors fly about the Nintendo NX Nintendo is wise in moving into mobile markets as the Wii U has limited niche appeal The Xbox One has a slate of exciting blockbuster exclusives coming as well as Xbox backwards compatibility The PS however probably wont be overtaken in existing markets Sonys lead is just too big Where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can overtake the PS is in the emerging console market of China Despite Chinas economic woes the Xbox One has huge potential if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>plays its cards right Disclaimer I have no direct interest in the console wars but I do own an Nintendo DS I recommend that each gamer fully research what they want in a console to provide the best gaming experience possible The great console wars of the eighth generation continue to rage on with Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Xbox One Sonys NYSE SNE Playstation and Nintendos OTCPKNTDOY OTCPKNTDOF Wii U duking it out for the affections of gamers around the world Recently updated global alltime sales numbers show that the PS continues to dominate its nearest rival the Xbox One by a nearly margin The major market the Xbox One holds a lead in is the United States and even there the lead is slim to the tune of units Despite this large lead however I believe the Xbox One has a lot to offer for the rest of and and Sony should be a little uneasy as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>rolls out longawaited games and features for the console Before we deal with the battle of the industry leaders lets take a look at Nintendo Nintendo is in a little bit of an awkward spot The firms legendary CEO Satoru Iwata recently passed away and rumors are swirling about the next Nintendo console codenamed the NX Some are alleging that the NX might even be both a home console and a handheld although those rumors are unsubstantiated at this time We really dont know anything at this point as Nintendo will probably remain silent on most everything until August Thats when a new Nintendo CEO might be announced as Japanese custom dictates that formal mourning periods last for days after a persons death And even then Nintendo will most likely remain ultrasecretive about the NX until either leaks or an official launch occur Undoubtedly the NX is hampering Wii U sales as it appears that Nintendo is getting its body ready to move on The Wii Us sales are not abjectly terrible but still lag far behind the Playstation and the Xbox One The company is the unquestioned champion of handhelds however and has seen remarkable growth in software sales and sales of the NFC reader figures amiibo Nintendos financial position is stronger as the firm is flush with cash from its latest game offerings like Splatoon To add even more unpredictability to the mix Nintendo has announced that they are finally making a foray into mobile gaming which is an area that holds much promise for the company However despite Nintendos awkward position in the current console wars I believe the company does have a place Nintendo is kind of like the old grandpa of gaming someone who you respect and venerate but might secretly discount his views when he goes ranting about politics or something But while you may dislike the rantings you certainly dont want him to go away Such is the case with Nintendo you may not like the Wii U or DS but you respect the company for what its trying to do While the Wii U has fallen by the wayside for the most part in terms of hard numbers Nintendo has a legion of loyal fans and its consoles have a small but powerful niche appeal You cant play Mario Legend of Zelda Smash Bros or Xenoblade on an Xbox or Playstation for example The Wii U is almost strictly a firstparty console It struggles to bring in third party developers but that wont deter loyal Nintendo fans from buying the Wii U While the Wii U and NXs fates remain to be seen Nintendo is in a much better place than when the Wii U was first revealed The Wii U finally has a compelling lineup to motivate fencesitters to take the plunge While the PS has big leads now the Xbox One certainly shouldnt be counted out After incessant demands from fans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is finally enabling backwards compatibility so you can play Xbox games on your Xbox One The Xbox One is also swimming in a veritable stream of huge exclusive games Before is out Xbox One owners will be able to play Halo Rise of the Tomb Raider Forza Gears of War Ultimate Edition and more And if that wasnt enough a big feature that gamers have been desperate for for ages is coming to Xbox One soon crossplay with PC games The PS has none of these things Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is promoting the Xbox One as doing things that cant be done on the PS Thats eerily reminiscent to Segas Genesis does what Nintendont ad campaign which nabbed Sega market share Arguably Sony is winning the console wars by a huge margin now due mostly to Microsofts blunders and the stellar stability of their first and second party titles But the Xbox One threatens to upend that with highly anticipated exclusive titles hitting stores one after the other Despite all the great stuff upcoming for the Xbox One though Sonys PS has such a huge lead at this point that it would take a truly revolutionary upending of the console wars to make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>king But that upending might be soon coming in the form of China China one of the worlds largest PC gaming markets recently legalized gaming consoles With the PCXbox cross play feature coming soon the Xbox One already has a big edge over the PS Despite a struggling economic and political situation in the country China has become the land of milk and honey for the big three as a previously impenetrable market has now become open season for consoles Overall while the PS has an enormous lead on the Xbox One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should make a comeback with the powerpacked lineup of exclusive games backwards compatibility and PCtoXbox cross play It remains to be seen what Nintendo is planning on doing with the NX but its clear that the Wii U is probably seeing its last days while the DS remains the handheld of choice for most onthego gamers Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not
