for PC stabilization ignore the continuing shift to mobile devices particularly the smartphone Once again the hoped for stabilization of sales of traditional form factor PCs desktop and laptop has failed to materialize in the first quarter of the year Clearly the ascendancy of mobile devices particularly the smartphone continues to disrupt companies such as Intel NASDAQ INTC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT that once dominated PCs but have little presence in smartphones Apple NASDAQ AAPL which invented the modern smartphone continues to reap most of the profits from it and still leads the mobile device revolution Both Gartner Research and IDC agree that PC shipments declined by about yy in Q Both companies point to a variety of factors such as global economic concerns the free Windows upgrade and the growth of detachable keyboard tablets which have been very successful for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Apple I recently pointed out that if Windows tablets were included with traditional PC form factors such as desktop and notebook the PC decline isnt as bad But the decline is still there except interestingly for Apple which gained market share in PCs on flat yy sales growth in Q The impact of the smartphone receives no mention from either research firm apparently in the belief that it cant possibly compete with the PC In fact I believe it is having an impact People are using their smartphones to perform numerous tasks that once would have been done on a PC checking email instant messaging watching videos and playing games Now this isnt a death of the PC article The utility of the smartphone has not been to render the PC useless but it has reduced the need for upgrades for many of us PCs still justify their use for demanding computing tasks in engineering for advanced gaming and now for virtual reality There will always be usage cases that justify a full fledged PC But there is a relentless shift toward increasing mobility which is dragging the traditional PC along with it This is why I think that things like Windows tablets really should be considered part of the PC mix At the extreme end of the mobility spectrum sits the smartphone which is increasingly the center of focus for personal computing Hardly a day goes by that I dont encounter an article decrying Apples lack of innovation and consequent decline and fall Its a staple of Apple bears To me this conveys a lack of understanding of the technological change that has fueled the ascendancy of mobile devices and the smartphone in particular Most people focus on the touch screen UI as the chief innovation of the iPhone which was readily and quickly copied by competitors To me this was not nearly as important as the underlying processor technology that Apple pioneered Apple has driven the growth of the smartphone from a communications accessory to a full fledged albeit petite personal computing device through its processor innovation Apple began developing its own custom processors in with the advent of the iPad but it was the development of the A system on chip SOC in for the iPhone s that really shook the industry The A was the first bit processor in any smartphone It was faster than any competing device while still being suitable for a low power device Over two years later such processors have become the norm making the smartphone nearly as computationally powerful as the PC Apples embracing of ARM NASDAQ ARMH architecture for its smartphones its development of custom SOCs and its pioneering bit processors have been the most important innovations of Apple since the iPhone was introduced in The impact of that innovation is still being felt today Intel tried and failed to enter the smartphone market failed primarily because it couldnt compete with Apples SOCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues to support ARM architecture in its smartphones because ARM has proven to be the best option Following Apples lead many key industry players such as Samsung OTCSSNLF and Huawei also engineer their own custom SOCs Apple has not merely engineered a better smartphone it has engineered a paradigm shift in the computer industry away from the PC commodity model Apple has reinvented the personal computer several times now The first time was with the original Apple II in The second time was with the first Mac in The third time was with the iPhone in Arguably the iPad was yet another reinvention but I consider the iPhone and iPad to be part of one product family They share a common operating system UI approach and processor architecture The main differences are in screen size a difference which is being blurred by the phablet scale iPhone and s Plus and in communications options With each reinvention of the PC Apple has reinvented itself in the process This ability to reinvent itself to discard outmoded technologies and ways of thinking is what has kept Apple innovative these past years Those impatient for the next reinvention overlook the fact that considerable time has elapsed between each reinvention in Apples history Each reinvention has been followed by a period of consolidation in which Apple harvests the economic benefits of its reinvention Clearly Apple is still harvesting the benefits of its iPhone innovation Apple continues to innovate but most of those innovations continue to be below the surface in the processor One of the most important innovations has been the development of Secure Enclave which also made its first appearance in the A Secure Enclave is a separate processor within the SOC dedicated to security tasks Secure Enclave is the principal reason that the FBI technique that was used to open the iPhone c in the San Bernardino terrorism case could not be used to open newer model iPhones as the FBI has admitted The ascendancy of mobile devices is being driven by more than their convenience and portability I think theres a fundamental economic driver related to Jevons Paradox as I discussed last year Jevons Paradox says that as technology becomes more efficient economic factors promote the use of that technology Mobile devices are more electrically efficient than typical PCs so I see that as the fundamental economic driver behind their widespread adoption The paradoxical effect that is referred to is that as the more efficient technology proliferates it leads to higher consumption of the resource it uses Thus even though mobile devices consume less energy the Jevons Paradox says that the larger number of devices will lead to higher energy consumption My focus here is not on the resource consumption aspect of the Paradox but on what it says about the intrinsic economic advantage of mobile devices The lower power consumption of mobile devices has in my view been the key driver behind their adoption Lower power consumption can be expected to continue to drive adoption and proliferation How do you get to even lower power devices By finding ways to make the devices even smaller and more compact and by innovating in processor technology to reduce power still further These considerations are the key drivers behind Apple Watch Watch is moving personal computing to an even smaller even lower power device It anticipates the even more computationally powerful processors that consume even less electricity that will arrive in the next few years Apple Watch is yet another reinvention of personal computing But its not the only candidate to supplant the smartphone There are others that also look to reduce physical screen size and energy consumption such as Microsofts Hololens or even Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Glass While such approaches are very interesting I believe that consumers will tend to adopt the less radical wrist worn devices for the next few years The growth of smart watches seems to confirm this As usual there are naysayers who point to all the shortcomings of Apples first generation smart watch Its too limited too redundant and too dependent on the iPhone This just ignores the obvious trend of increasing functionality being incorporated into mobile devices But Apple has been living with this trend and anticipating and benefiting from it since the first iPhone The recent understandable focus on the expected yy decline in iPhone sales and revenue for the March quarter fiscal Q tends to obscure Apples dominant role in the paradigm shift to mobile devices Apple invented the modern smartphone in Apple invented the modern smartphone processor in Apple is taking the smartphone even smaller with Apple Watch Theres no want for innovation at Apple Apples continued dominance of mobile computing is neatly summarized by its share of industry profits as of late last year Apples ability to deploy huge capital resources as in the building of its new campus and its probable investments overseas with partners such as TSMC NYSE TSM and Foxconn virtually guarantees that it can maintain its mobile leadership position I will acknowledge that the capacity for reinvention is somewhat leadership dependent Apple critics often like to point to the leadership of Steve Jobs as critical for this I agree this is a risk factor but what were seeing with Apple Watch conveys to me that reinvention is alive and well at Apple I believe Apple investors should look past fiscal Q and Q to fiscal Q In the September quarter well see the introduction of a new iPhone featuring an all new design and processor along with a new operating system We will probably also see a new revised Apple Watch with a new processor and watchOS as well How these products do will be much more important in gauging
