class='textDiv'>The Case That Apple Is Worth At Least A Share Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha After accounting for net cash Apples shares trade at a surprisingly large and unexplained discount to that of the average stock This article argues that its known ongoing businesses deserve a premium valuation equal to that of Google The point also is argued that AAPLs free cash flow is much too high also suggesting that the stock is greatly undervalued Additional support for the shares comes from Apples many areas of expertise and famous brand name allowing it growth opportunities for many years to come In the past year Apple NASDAQ AAPL has turned the story around from stagnation to one of rapid innovative product development This dynamism has given the company stronger current growth prospects than the US or global economy enjoy With the advent of the Apple Watch and the CY Q results of Apples main megacap competitors of Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT in the books this article makes the case that the stars are aligning for AAPLs PE to rise relative to the market NYSEARCA SPY and very possibly in absolute terms Assuming this occurs combined with rising or even accelerating EPS the stock could have very strong upside in the months and years immediately ahead My point of view is that whether or not I agree with all his points the lonely and selfserving investment thesis of Carl Icahn that AAPL is worth over per share is reasonable and valid Since Apple reports using GAAP I use GAAP or as close to GAAP as I can throughout the article This is fair to companies such as Google and most other companies which do not have the free cash flow relative to GAAP EPS that Apple enjoys AAPL has unusually strong riskreward characteristics for a leading tech stock especially given its many leadership roles in computing and telecommunications I see Apple extending its profit leadership in tech being relatively safe if the economy turns south and as having numerous diversified growth opportunities AAPL is trading at Using Value Lines the oldest major independent stock analytic service CY EPS estimate AAPL is trading at about X forward GAAP EPS which it projects at The average stock Value Line covers is at more like X projected EPS That in and of itself makes AAPL relatively undervalued However AAPL has something like share or more in excess cash and marketable securities net of all debt whereas most companies have little or no excess financial assets including most large companies Adjusting AAPLs share price lower for those net financial assets brings its relative PE to about a onethird discount compared with the average Value Line stock This makes AAPL probably the greatest bargain relative to the market that I have ever seen adjusted for its massive size financial strength and many other strengths The next two sections address the questions of how cheap AAPL is to different comparators The third section addresses whether the stock is truly attractive in the long run Ill start with a comparison with GOOG which has a higher PE than either AAPL or MSFT Both Apple and Google have cashrich finances brilliant CEOs great growth records and apparently bright futures Both companies follow certain best practices such as splitting the CEO and Chairman of the Board positions Google however has three classes of stock that may entrench management whereas Apple has only one class That is a point in AAPLs favor Now that Google has come out with Q earnings its slowdown is clear Per Value Line data Google has grown EPS at a CAGR over the past years this pace has decelerated to for the past five years It is clear from Qs sales and earnings pace that as of now Value Lines projected slowdown to about growth through about is reasonable This is reflected in Yahoo Finance updates on GOOGs EPS trends The above is nonGAAP cashbased earnings data basically cash flow It omits such material factors that Mr Buffett fought so hard for so long to get accepted namely that the value of stockbased compensation is a real cost that should be estimated when the grants occur In February Value Line projected diluted EPS of for GOOG of Note that Value Line in this case is not using GAAP in a strict sense but it is mostly using GAAP by including options expense This EPS estimate is good enough for my purposes right now Value Lines estimate for GOOGs Q was However GAAP EPS came in at up only over Q In contrast AAPL at is at X CY projected EPS I think that GOOGs multiple is appropriate after accounting for its massive cash hoard which is not dissimilar as a percentage of market capitalization from AAPLs So now I will try to show that AAPL deserves at least a roughly similar PE to GOOG A The diagram is from Geekwire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>exec Why Apple and Google have an advantage and how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>plans to compete The relative size of the circles indicates the number of users during the window of time that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>conducted the study The lines indicate when users of one product are more likely to use another If one adds the Apple Watch and Apple Pay to Apples very tight and intertwined ecosystem as shown above two things happen One is that the system a veritable web gets even stronger just as a spiders web does The other is that the iPhone becomes more central than it is shown in the diagram In contrast Googles ecosystem is less tight though stronger than Microsofts And as we know Apples revenue per iOS user is much higher than for Android Not only does Apple have the ecosystem lead but its revenue and therefore profit per customer is greater than for Google Ecosystems are more important than individual products over the long run Products evolve incorporate other functions and make previous major products such as the iPod into insignificant parts of the enlarged whole when the ecosystem is thriving dynamically This is why Im not overly concerned about the point that Apple is a oneproduct company It is for now but increasingly it is a growing spiders web that attracts willing customers These customers evince extraordinarily high satisfaction levels and participate financially in the ecosystem more than do Googles ecosystem customers Apples growing ecosystem thus leads the tech world and justifies a relatively higher PE than companies with less tight ecosystems This advantage of Apple is magnified when one considers the greater spending per customer it enjoys Summarizing this subsection the portion of Googles business that competes more or less directly with Apple deserves a lower not a higher multiple of earnings Googles core advertisingrelated business is likely to receive a higher PE than Apples hardwareoriented business but with an inferior ecosystem it is unclear why GOOGL really deserves a higher PE than AAPL B The other comparison method is more traditional Apple is in a resurgent mode after a couple of years in which following the momentum it had in into sales and earnings stagnated after an unbelievable decade of growth Apple has rebounded from the many challenges it faced after Steve Jobs passed away and deserves a higher PE appropriate to its recent sales and EPS momentum Google however has seen decelerating growth in sales profits EPS and as discussed in the next paragraph free cash flow Google is finding that it must spend heavily now on fixed assets such as data centers Using Value Lines historical and projected data for capital spending Google has gone from spending very roughly of sales on capital projects in to more like last year and a similar percentage projected through This is harming the companys FCF generation In contrast Apples capital spending is remaining minimal or less as a percentage of sales Thus AAPLs FCF is about equal to its EPS GOOG however had cash flow of about per share last year but about in capital spending meaning that it had about in FCF For a dominant tech stock trading near it is not generating a compelling amount of FCF GOOG is probably trading at only about a forward FCF yield Why should the FCF yields for AAPL and GOOGL be very different Beyond the FCF and growth rate trends other trends point in the identical proAAPL direction Compare Apple Pay and Apples brilliant Authentec acquisition and Apple Watch to Googles equivalent efforts Then theres the fiasco of Google Glass Apple is executing better than Google right now that deserves to be reflected in a higher relative PE for AAPL vs GOOG Thus even if Googles ad business is a better business than Apples hardwareoriented business Im not certain thats correct but for sake of argument I wont argue the point putting all the other factors together its appropriate to give AAPL a similar forward PE to GOOG Using for CY for AAPL well know more soon and using GOOGs X multiple gets AAPL right around the Icahn fair value estimate of Theres a second completely different liketolike comparison that helps validate the concept that AAPLs fair value is at least AAPL is dirt cheap compared to Apples debt securities Basic financial theory posits that stocks and bonds are in some equilibrium with each other An AAPL year bond was very recently reported to trade at a yield to maturity In comparison AAPLs FCF yield the inverse of its priceFCF ratio is on a forward basis If one excludes AAPLs net cash and marketable securities from AAPLs price the forward FCF yield is around This is way too skewed toward the bond especially with all the risks of owning a year corporate bond yielding only It is rare to have shares of a financial powerhouse with strong growth ahead be so undervalued relative to its own debt I would ask why AAPL should not trade at a FCF yield in line for now with the bond and similar to GOOG After all Apple Inc is growing again and given its leadership position in secular growth areas of the global economy its FCF yield arguably might deserve to be lower than its fixed bond yield not higher Im not expecting that to occur but its a reasonable thought It is how tech stocks were valued relative to interest rates throughout the s even before the final bubble How much growth can we expect long term from Apple American businesses have grown sales and profits at a rate for decades To assume less than that for AAPL is extremely pessimistic I would assume a faster rate than for the next decade Perhaps later it is appropriate to be cautious and assume though Im more optimistic than that as discussed in the next section In any case given all the uncertainties a FCF yield for AAPL strikes me as not only fair but quite attractive given todays interest rates and PEs and FCF yields seen in the stock market as a whole A FCF yield also points to a plus fair value for AAPL Apple has numerous growth opportunities beyond its current ecosystem One of the semiexistential risks to Apple that bears point to is that it the great disrupter may get disrupted some day and the deflationary pressures of consumer electronics may help lay it low This could happen But I think not I think that Apple is growing to grow strongly in its current businesses I believe that Apple has more major growth opportunities beyond its current operations in the next decade and even the next decades than any major company relative to the stocks market cap Eventually it may be more perhaps much more than just a computerphone company anymore This possibility is not in AAPLs price I believe theres a general underappreciation of the numerous worldclass and often worldleading capabilities Apple has developed in its long struggle to the top of the corporate heap Apple is the best retailer in the world Apple designs the most memorable innovative retail stores in the world Apple is a powerful materials company as its new aluminum and gold alloys used in the Apple Watch show Apple is a topnotch battery company and a great digital camera company Apple also is a great fabless semiconductor company More broadly Apple is far and away the premier product designer for a very large company in the world possibly the best the world has ever seen given the scale of Apples business operations As we see with the recent MacBook with Apple Pay and I believe with the Apple Watch Apple is hitting on all cylinders in product design and attention to detail In addition Apple under Tim Cook may now be a brilliant corporate tactician I suspect that its surprise alliance with IBM NYSE IBM may eventually go far beyond developing apps Maybe one of Apples goals is to allow not just iOS but also OSX to penetrate the enterprise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may in my view be a target of the AppleIBM alliance A major success in the enterprise is not in AAPLs valuation either All these positives meet up with a very strong experienced management team thats highly loyal to the company Apple will in my view be able to find plenty of growth areas in the knowledgebased future economy that extend beyond its current ecosystem which itself may have massive growth ahead Automobiles Solar installations Media creation not just distribution Expanded financial services All these and many more possible large business opportunities have been suggested by a number of people who know Apple well Im confident that Apple has thought deeply about what businesses it finds most attractive not only for the next five years but for a number of years beyond that Ill just ride along and see how their plan unfolds Theres little point in trying to outguess Apples management So rather than fearing that Apple will sink like Nokia NYSE NOK or BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY I look at the future for Apple Inc much more optimistically I think that the world is Apples oyster and that in the years and decades ahead Apple is wellpositioned to grow by designing and marketing new products that build upon its many formidable strengths No reward comes without risk at least in investing AAPL is the leading stock in the world and will tend to move with the market even if it is operating successfully Economic problems in the US or China would hurt Apples sales and profits On a more granular level Apple is highly dependent on the iPhones success The Apple Watch may not do much for the iPhones sales and for whatever reason pricecutting and stronger competition than I anticipate could harm the iPhone in a major secular fashion While theres trading and fundamental risk in AAPL I see it as less risky than many other places for capital including some that traditionally are thought to be riskfree So I agree with Value Line which lists AAPL as a No rated stock for safety top of all stocks Technicals and trading considerations One small knock against AAPL is that it has a low short interest relative to the float So theres little upside from a short squeeze That aside the chart is constructive in all material respects Theres no meaningful overhead resistance Can AAPL actually get to a theoretical fair value of or above any time soon Im skeptical but the older I get the more patient I get Theres no rush The dividend will increase and stay ahead of riskfree alternatives and eventually relative valuations work themselves out Trying to time when they may do so is so difficult that its not worth the time and effort I basically like AAPLs technical situation and think that the stock is wellpositioned to move toward fair value at a rate that will make shareholders happy Looking at AAPL from the standpoint of an observer of the tech scene for half a century I disagree with Mr Market on AAPL Why might the market be inefficient in valuing AAPL Who knows It appears strange This simply looks like a truly rare opportunity to buy a great company at a price that would be attractive in almost any market environment In this era of richlyvalued stocks and bonds I like this stock that much more This valuation discount offers additional upside potential if Apple succeeds in the quarters and years ahead as my base case suggests and also provides some downside projection if business trends are disappointing Source The Case That Apple Is Worth At Least A
