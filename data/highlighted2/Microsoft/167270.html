anywhere on AMDs roadmap Many believe that Intels innovation is on hiatus but this is clearly false AMDs lack of even remote competitiveness in the PC market is a big concern especially for AMDs upcoming game changer Zen due next year Thanks to last years Intel NASDAQ INTC Core M processors notebooks could take a giant leap into ultrathin form factors that were formerly exclusive to tablets Although these chips took a step back in performance speed enhancements over time let even Apple NASDAQ AAPL adopt the chip in its new MacBook The original MacBook Air revolutionized the notebook industry including all of the Macs to follow and I expect the same to occur with the new MacBook Unfortunately AMD NASDAQ AMD doesnt even remotely play a role in this evolution of form factors and is more absorbed in simply surviving on fumes Expectedly AMD has nothing of significance to compete with lately but with former Apple chip experts Jim Keller and Raj Koduri now working for AMD again perhaps glory is just around the bend But Im still kind of curious Does AMD have it in them And if not will Intel simply wipe them off the face of the semiconductor industry Since AMD and Intel are the only x kids in town with the latter being far greater its clear why many believe Intels innovation is lazily on hiatus but this couldnt be further from the truth The x PC market has been threatened by the rise of tablets and smartphones and although it may only be AMDs intention to survive within this boundary its Intels every intention to expand the architecture to thrive within the whole new generation of ultrathin notebooks tablets and smartphones A few years ago it was questionable whether or not it was possible Even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT decided on its own that the only way it could create a tablet PC was through an ARMbased OS Thus came Windows RT and the debut of the original Surface tablet running on an Nvidiamade NASDAQ NVDA ARM chip Fast forward to today ARMbased Windows has been trashed and Microsofts Surface and Surface Pro both utilize Intels painstaking efforts in creating ultrathin form factors According to Microsofts recent earnings report Surface Revenue grew by an outstanding YOY thanks to the newest renditions and with companies like Lenovo attempting to copy the Surface we can only conclude that the tablet PC is here to stay Last year Broadwells Core M was the evolution of x chips that even Apple was waiting for It was the beginning of performance computing ditching the fans to become passively cooled Apple wasnt too interested in the first rendition of the Broadwell Core M due to the performance drawbacks that were made in order to achieve the design but after some speed enhancements Apple happily obliged using it for the ludicrously thin MacBook Intel had succeeded Apple didnt or hasnt yet gone to ARM and the x chip lives another generation The story is very similar to the original MacBook and now all Intel has to do is improve performance and reduce power consumption which is exactly what the latest Skylakes Core M is On Intels press release for the new Skylake processors you will find that stats of the Core M are several times faster than several yearold systems which is really meaningless However I did find in Gizmodos writing that Intel tells us that on average youll see better performance better graphics performance and an extra hour of battery life while playing P video compared to last years Broadwell chips Aside from graphics these enhancements are fairly ordinary Some may see this as a chance for AMD but AMD isnt even remotely present in this market The only new presence that AMD has in the mobile market are the notebooks using its latest sixth generation Carrizo processors found within this list Yes all of those hunky notebooks are fatter uglier heavier and more expensive than Microsofts Surface tablet and roughly the cost of the Surface Pro as well as the upcoming Lenovo Ideapad MIIX The list appears to be growing but I have no idea how anything there will sell and if nothing sells how will AMD launch its extremely anticipated Zen chip next year AMDs competitive standpoint against Intel is far worse than I could have ever imagined If it werent for Rory Read and his intent on diversifying the chipmakers product portfolio AMD would undoubtedly be history Fortunately AMD has consoles discreet graphics and embedded chips among other streams working in its favor but the rapidly falling PC revenues still make up half of the companys income I have a feeling that AMD will work some way around it and as an investor I hope it does but with what magic tricks I dont know Most of the articles I write on AMD are of a bullish nature and with a very small position Im deep down bullish for the company With great risk comes great rewards and loss The industries AMD is involved in are worth hundreds of billions so the upside is astronomical with future success However the end result is up in the air so anyone buying or shorting better be cautious Disclosure I amwe are long AMD MoreI wrote this article myself and it
