Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a good example of a company that has had various valuations over the years This article demonstrates what can occur if you buy a security with an ultimately expanding earnings multiple In the end its about identifying solid businesses and trying to capture business performance or better The concept of buy low sell high is perhaps the most wellknown financial adage out there Of course anyone in the investing world knows that is overwhelmingly easier said than done The problem is that you have a great deal of intelligent people all controlling different gobs of money working toward the same goal Add in an uncertain world and constantly changing expectations and you have a true challenge confronting you As the old Keynes quote goes The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent That is even if youre correct in your assertion a challenge on its own theres no set schedule as to when everyone else must also realize this More plainly its difficult to do in practice what this article is about to illustrate However I would contend that the process is still worth exploring The benefit of seeing an expanding earnings multiple can provide a true boon for returns <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is a prime security to illustrate this The companys valuation has bounced about a good deal over the years leading to times when the investment results have varied dramatically from the business performance Ill give you some examples From through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was growing earnings by and per year Thats fantastic business performance Yet the investment performance was even greater climbing by nearly per year Despite the spectacular business results the share price greatly outpaced business performance This sort of thing doesnt last forever From through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grew earnings per share by about annually still solid but not quite as impressive as the past As a result shares that began trading at times earnings were suddenly less attractive The share price fell by an average rate of per year resulting in significant capital depreciation These sorts of ups and downs in valuation have been occurring for some time Heres a table illustrating the concept During the entire period both earnings and the share price grew by per annum Over the course of very long time periods this is more or less what you would expect share price appreciation tracking business performance Yet its clear that this didnt happen in a regular or linear fashion Often investors are overly enthusiastic or overly pessimistic resulting in investment returns that vary dramatically from business performance Lets take a look at a period when Microsofts multiple was expanding to get a better feel for the effect At the end of after reporting fiscal year earnings around shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>were trading just over for an earnings multiple a bit above Now admittedly this is a cherry picked time period as alluded to above but the point is to demonstrate what can happen when your investment sees an expansion in its earnings multiple Since that time the business has done reasonably well Last year the company earned per share equating to a compound annual growth rate of about Also during this time investors would have collected roughly in dividend payments as well Had the multiple stayed the same todays share price would be around Add in the worth of dividends and you would have come to a collective value of about or an annualized gain of roughly per year And thats prior to thinking about reinvestment Had you simply received business results your investment would have nicely compounded your wealth during the time Yet thats not quite what happened <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>no longer trades at times earnings Instead todays multiple is closer to times adjusted earnings Todays share price is over resulting in a true value for the longterm owner who bought at the end of of about This represents an annual compound gain of over per year Its the difference between turning a investment into or just This is what an expanding multiple can do for returns The investment returns of the security greatly outpaced the business results Business performance would have been quite reasonable but business performance plus a doubled earnings multiple leads to exceptional results Now obviously you cant expect to always invest in companies at the most opportune times Investing a year later would have resulted in annual gains of just while a year earlier would have provided annualized gains of only timing can make a big difference Yet the underlying notion remains fundamental You dont have to time investments perfectly to benefit from the concept First youre looking for a solid business that youd be happy to own for years Without this step youre relying on what other people may or may not be willing to pay With this step it becomes a bit easier to deal with the constant ebbs and flows of everyday bids Presumably youd be happy with business performance if you were happy to own the business The next step if figuring out whether or not youre getting a fair shake That is whether or not the value paid gives you a fair opportunity to capture the business performance With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trading at times earnings that gave you a fair shake and indeed then some Sure the business could have traded with a lower PE ratio but the likelihood of a similar or higher multiple in the future was on your side Moreover you didnt need to partner with the company at times to see this play out Had you bought shares at or or times earnings today you still would have seen investment performance that outpaced the business results of the company Naturally this doesnt just apply to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The goal is to identify a group of excellent businesses and then see whether or not you stand a fair chance at capturing business performance or better Conceptually this looks like partnering with Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ at times earnings or CocaCola NYSE KO at times Lower valuations come about from time to time but your stacking the odds in your favor when you demand a fair or better valuation Business results by themselves are often satisfactory seeing an
