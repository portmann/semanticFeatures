margins while lowering Mac prices requires cost cutting and when it comes to processors Intel and Nvidia arent very cooperative AMD given its situation has been very cooperative and has allowed itself to replace Nvidia in many Mac products AMDs semicustom business will make it even more cooperative AMDs technology has improved dramatically and with a compelling new architecture arriving late next year it could be a winwin for both Apple and AMD When Steve Jobs was around Apples NASDAQ AAPL vision was very clearly to make the greatest products in the world almost regardless of price This was also when the Mac was out of the reach of the average consumer but after several price reductions over the years the Mac has now become much more affordable for the average consumer Apples continued price drops will undoubtedly entice more Mac users but it could be at the cost of its attractive margins if it continues to use Intel NASDAQ INTC and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA processors One plausible solution is to replace Intels x chips with Apples own ARM NASDAQ ARMH processors but through a complex transition Another solution is to replace Intels costly x processors with AMDs NASDAQ AMD much more affordable x processors of course this would be with AMDs late Zen product which is a groundup architecture that many people believe will be AMDs saving grace and a great competitor to Intels chips Apple has already begun to grasp the costbenefits that AMD has provided by replacing much of its expensive Nvidia graphics chips with AMDs justaseffective much more affordable graphics solutions Such solutions include the Mac Pro K iMac and MacBook Pro with Retina Display Additionally AMD has a very good graphics API and the best way to utilize this API with the greatest cost savings is to copy what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Sony NYSE SNE did with the Xbox One and PS gaming consoles These companies asked AMD to create a very customized CPUGPU processing solution that would be both powerful costeffective and efficient since all of the processing is on a single die Thanks to this Sony debuted a gaming console far cheaper than the previous generation while actually generating a profit instead of an enormous loss Intels graphics are far inferior to AMDs and separately using Intels CPU technology and Nvidias GPU technology was just far too costly for Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and so AMD was the perfect choice If AMD were to utilize a successful Zen chip tied with technologies like HighBandwidth Memory and Heterogenous System Architecture in a customized chip solution for Apple it would be a winwin for the two companies Apple would be able to continue to make toptier products but at much more affordable pricing and AMD would restore its reputation and generate meaningful income for investors who suffer with a stock near an alltime low Two years ago Apple finally accepted AMDs products mostly thanks to affordability and decided to power its most powerful workstation with two Radeon professional graphics processors Professional graphics is a highmargin business and AMD definitely bit the bullet here However Apple was able to create a highlyaffordable workstation solution that delivered a priceperformance ratio that was unmatched by any other workstation on the market This was an excellent win for AMD and over the next two years Apple adopted AMDs GPUs in its prestigious K iMac and more recently the MacBook Pro with Retina Display As far as Im concerned the graphics of Apples Macs are now only powered by Intels integrated chips and AMDs discrete chips This is a cheaper combination but having the two processors as separate units is a major cost disadvantage A semicustom processor is a solution that AMD provides for customers who want an entirely unique fullycustomizable chip for any kind of application ranging from workstations to gaming consoles Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>were the first to utilize this feature with the PS and Xbox One and the resulting solution allowed these companies to generate a powerful efficient and highly costeffective solution on a single die There was no other company in the world who could offer this singledie solution in a costeffective manner because Intels graphics were far too inferior for gaming consoles and Nvidia doesnt offer a compelling CPU solution that could match Intels or AMDs x processors Surely Intel and Nvidia could create an amazing solution with two separate processors but the cost would be through the rooof with the high margins that both companies demand With a semicustom solution Apple could go to AMD pay an upfront RD fee and tell AMD exactly what it needs for whatever kind of Mac it intends on creating Currently with AMDs inferior products such a solution at Apples high standards would be impossible However with AMDs future groundup architecture Zen coupled with technologies such as HighBandwidth Memory HSA and its highperformance graphics chips AMD could provide Apple with a very compelling allinone solution Furthermore since AMD is struggling to survive and will be in dire need of any design win by the time Zen comes out I have a feeling that the chipmaker will be very interested in sacrificing its alreadylow margins to help the worlds most valuable company create a powerful lowcost solution to entice more consumers After years of shunning AMD Apple changed its mind and is now using Radeon GPUs as its discrete graphics solution instead of Nvidias costly chips This was a vital decision for Apple in order to maintain its impressive margins while creating costeffective solutions AMDs graphics solutions are years ahead of Intels and as the only other x chipmaker in the world it can theoretically replace some Intel chips with a smooth transition which would be far more favorable to the complex transition that ARM chips would pose Furthermore AMD provides a unique semicustom business that would allow Apple to obtain completely customized processors which could lower costs dramatically in the same way that the semicustom business helped create the powerful yet highly affordable PS and Xbox One We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
