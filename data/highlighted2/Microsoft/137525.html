NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has turned to the upcoming Gamification niche in an effort to find innovation and differentiation for its Dynamics CRM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has also left open the door however for its new Gamification acquisition to be integrated into competing CRM platforms as well a strategy shift from days of old I believe Gamification is the next evolution of CRM and quite possibly nonCRM platforms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will do well to lead the way Microsofts purchase of Incent Games is a clear execution on all three Satya Nadella outlined strategic initiatives and speaks well to the cultural shift taking place at the company Ive often expressed to Seeking Alpha tech investors the importance of closely following the private tech markets Ive said before that the private markets are a literal farm system for the public markets in that the best tech from the private side where of the spaces innovation takes place becomes the next valuation driver on the public side Thats if the private side outperformer doesnt decide to itself come public Square is going to be the next great example in which case youre going to want to have followed the IPO closely from as far back as possible anyways It just makes sense In following the private tech markets and I have an unfair advantage in that I consult private tech startups I noticed a particular trend of startups popping up from the usual hotspots of Austin San Francisco Seattle and from the new hotspots in Asia that were also seeing what I would deem irregular traction at very early stage of development These startups all were involved in the Gamification niche or put simply turning tasks into games Now you might be thinking about companies of the Foursquare ilk but youd have it all wrong The new gamification companies are sharper better interfaced more flexible and much much more mature if you will It was in this observation that I opined in a HubSpot NYSE HUBS article that the company buy best of breed gamification startup Playbasis I thought at the time that HubSpot should add Playbasis in that Playbasis could improve the engagement and therefore efficacy of its broader Inbound Marketing platform Now in light of HubSpots announcement that it has taken its CRM out of beta and into general use I believe a Playbasis acquisition makes even more sense Gamification being infused with CRM makes complete and obvious sense in that the more CRM is used the higher level of efficacy CRM shows This data is apparent and widely accepted in the techsales industries regardless of which CRM is being deployed the arguments only begin at which CRM is best at driving efficacy Apparently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT which itself has a CRM engine in Dynamics CRM agrees with me on all accounts On August rd <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced the acquisition of Austinbased Gamification startup Incent Games Incent Games developed and sells flagship product FantasySalesTeam FantasySalesTeam is a gamification engineplatform that does exactly what I was promoting that Playbasis does It incentivizes users to hit milestones via a gamelike achievement tracking system In this instance one that is similar to that of many fantasy sports platforms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>intends to drop FantasySalesTeam into Dynamics CRM to do exactly what I thought HubSpot could do increase engagement and drive efficacy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also in a rare move by the company has left open FantasySalesTeam for integration into other competing CRMs including that offered by salesforcecom NYSE CRM Now in buying Incent Games <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>accomplishes three key strategies in one acquisition I also believe the purchase is evidence of the Satya Nadella regimes sweeping cultural changes which might be the more important broader implication of the purchase The two concepts however are intertwined and hard to separate which is yet another positive of the newMicrosoft Ill explain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has made a serious and concentrated effort to do three things since new CEO Satya Nadella took the top position at the company One to become a single unified technology platform two to not alienate users and nonusers by forcing all platform activity to come from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>branded tech and three to be an innovator Again the company does all three with the seemingly small implication acquisition of Incent Games <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does further unify its one platform by increasing the valueadd of its CRM with the FantasySalesTeam integration An increased take rate for its CRM could lead to an increased take rate for its productivity suite An increased take rate for the productivity suite could lead to an increased take rate for its Power BI So on and so on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt going to alienate nonDynamics CRM users by forcing them to switch to have access to FantasySalesTeam In keeping open the integration channels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is keeping open the possibility to introduce users of salesforcecoms CRM to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>product andor allowing say a user of its productivity suite and salesforcecoms CRM put simply a dual salesforcecom and a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>customer access to both products he or she wants without forcing switching of any kind This is a vastly different approach than that used during the Ballmer era <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is showing a cultural shift in that it realizes it cant be all things to all people Yet another underlying cultural theme pivot under Nadella that wasnt there under Ballmer Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has chosen to lead with innovation in buying Incent Gaming rather than wait for established norms to drive its decision making The latter has led <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to a stagnant market cap and to poor innovation chasing moves which most recently led to a billion write down The company would like to avoid those mistakes going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is willing to take a chance on helping drive adoption of broader gamification integration and in its risk will likely see a market share capture if successful Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>noted in a blog post announcing the Incent Gaming purchase that it would look for other nonCRM deployment options for FantasySalesTeam Could this mean as Playbasis has pioneered an ability for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Dynamics CRM customers to allow their customers use of FantasySalesTeam If so look for Playbasis to be the next name to be taken off the board as its the only other name Im aware of that offers this as a service that makes sense for customers customers Well have to see what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has in the works as FantasySalesTeam optimizes integration So all told I think this purchase is meaningful to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>story and for that matter the broader CRM space as well I believe the next innovation to take place in CRM is going to be Gamification and that the first movers are going to have a distinct advantage Whats interesting about the Gamification space however that might be partially negating to a CRM engine firstmover advantage is the wide differences between gamification engines For instance Incent Games engine shares zero similarities with Playbasis engine In saying that whichever delivery mechanism for instance gamification via fantasy sports platform or via a more general reward platform think points trophies etc that can show the greatest efficacy should prove out to create the CRM spaces longterm gamification integration winner In that it might makes sense for a CRM platform owner read <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to acquire multiple gamification engines to provide optionality within its platform This will be an interesting development to watch going forward Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Leading The Next Evolution In CRM With
