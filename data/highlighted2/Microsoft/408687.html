historical maximum The current PE ratio is not as high as in but still holds at exorbitant levels relative to the market The companys revenues analysis shows that it is losing ground to competitors in many product lines These are serious problems that will affect the companys valuation in the long term Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT shares are currently trading in the range of which is close to the values of their historic high in The absolute maximum price was per share At that price the PE equaled to x earnings per share During the last years Microsofts median PE has equaled to x During the same period the maximum PE was equal to x which is very close to the current value of x We would like to draw your attention to Microsofts trend in revenues and earnings Lately the companys net income is not just stagnating but has also been showing a negative trend such as in Q despite the increase in revenues In our opinion it is a bright indicator of the evolving structural problems in the business These are longterm problems which must be paid attention to by the companys investors A similar story has been developing with IBM NYSE IBM Indeed IBM is now a successful and stable company However does it take a leading place in terms of capitalization Is IBM now valued by the market with a PE ratio of or more Clearly it is not In order to assess the prospects of the company it is very important to look at the structure of its revenues As we can see office programs bring about of total revenues while another are contributed by servers and associated businesses Another come from the operating system The remaining comes from other lines of business The servers business is undoubtedly the most secure division within the company from the income perspective In the era of continuous information growth servers are a kind of real estate in computer technology Office programs also look quite stable although there are many competitors on the market and retaining a stable market share is becoming more difficult As for the other areas they do not look so solid For example the operating system the main product of the company which has made it famous throughout world is losing ground Once a monopoly Windows OS occupied more than of the market back in However by the end of the system was installed on about of all computers Today mobile technologies are one of the fastest growing areas During more than billion smartphones were sold globally and by this figure will amount to more than billion However this is not the point The point is that the smartphone is replacing the PC in terms of the use of time The smartphone is becoming the primary mean of communications on the Internet Unfortunately Windows did not have time to win in this race In the Windows Phone occupied only of the market having lost about since To sum up the key idea is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is currently valued as a growth company However it is important to understand that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is no longer a growth company It is a pretty slow and clumsy giant The current PE ratio is unreasonably high It is extremely unlikely that we see a jump in net profit longterm growth rates The average net sales over the past four years equaled B Given the absence of new products which could significantly change revenue growth even under favorable circumstances the companys sales will not exceed the maximum value reached over the past several years B in the near future We think many would agree that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a typical representative of the American market background so that the average PE coefficient of x is a good estimate of the shares fair value Given the current EPS of the price of per share seems to be fair However even at this level the share price does not include the chances of market loss for the companys products Therefore at this point short sellers have a margin of safety Even if the company manages to maintain a strong position in many segments its fair value is around per share not per share as it is valued at right now Societe Financiers is an investment
