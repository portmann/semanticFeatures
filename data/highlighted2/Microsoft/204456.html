class='textDiv'>Down Since Earnings Its Time For Fitbit To Track Higher Fitbit Inc NYSEFIT Seeking Alpha Fitbits onetwo punch seems like the right strategy for the companys future growth There is a decline coming at Fitbit but its not what you think For those who believe Fitbit will be killed by the Apple Watch there is one number you need to know Fitbit NYSE FIT investors are likely split into two camps Those who bought shares near the IPO price are up roughly Anyone who bought shares right before the companys recent earnings release is down just over This is a perfect example of what Peter Lynch observed about stock prices He said that sometimes the movement of a stock price in the shortterm has nothing do to with the fundamentals of the company In Fitbits case there are reasons to believe the stock will get back on track The first reason to believe that Fitbit may be about to surge higher has to do with the companys ambitions in the billion corporate wellness business The Fitbit brand is primarily thought of as a retail product with most of the focus around gift giving and New Years resolutions However if Fitbit can continue to sign new corporate wellness agreements the companys sales and earnings should become more stable Businesses know that employees who are more active are less likely to have as many sick days and medical issues in general Fitbit brings the company the ability to track employees activity and drive a more health aware workplace The companys strategy seems to be working and the good news for investors is there is a long way to go Fitbit said it inked deals with companies such as Geico Transunion and several financial institutions At present Fitbit has agreements with of the Fortune companies To give investors some perspective Apple NASDAQ AAPL seems to have taken the opposite approach with the iPad in particular While the iPads sales were growing the companys focus seemed to be on the retail buyer However Apple reported an annual drop in iPad units sold last quarter Ironically Tim Cook CEO of Apple said he was excited about the iPads future because of the business applications it could be used for By contrast Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Office suite has been a commercial staple for years Today its rare to find a company not using standard Office file formats As users gained experience using Office at work the product picked up steam in the retail space When it comes to technology familiarity breeds use The point is Fitbit seems to be taking a page from both Apple and Microsofts playbooks The company is pursuing the retail customer by placing its products in over stores At the same time Fitbit is pushing into the commercial space by convincing businesses to provide fitness trackers to their employees One challenge Fitbit will face is it may have to accept lower prices to continue signing up corporate accounts That being said the companys onetwo punch of retail and corporate growth seems like the right strategy to give investors a smoother ride over time A decline that investors may have missed The second reason Fitbit appears on track to resume its move upward has to do with the companys share count guidance for the next few quarters In a growing company its not usual for the diluted share count to increase as stockbased compensation is a common tool to attract and retain talented employees That being said companies that are free cash flow positive will many times repurchase shares as a way to return cash to investors For example Apples diluted shares declined by annually while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>retired of its diluted shares Fitbit is free cash flow positive and there is a hint that it may put some of this cash to work retiring shares The companys core free cash flow net income depreciation capex in the last three months was over million In the current quarter the companys nonGAAP diluted shares were million Next quarter Fitbit expects diluted shares between million and million However for the full year Fitbit expects a diluted share count of million to million If this prediction comes to fruition this would imply a decline of between and compared to this quarter This seems to suggest easier EPS growth going into the companys back half of the year The third reason to believe that Fitbit is ready to run is the companys average selling price should continue to climb It seems like the overarching worry about Fitbit is related to the potential success of the Apple Watch In the fitness tracking market Microsofts Band doesnt get a lot of press but has many of the features of the Apple Watch for of the price The good news for Fitbit investors is the Apple Watch and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Band arent real competition based on price In the last quarter Fitbits average selling price jumped from to Fitbits most popular models were the Charge Charge HR and Surge which made up of sales This is very good news for investors as these devices sell for between and Fitbit said it is finally able to keep the Charge HR in stock Since this model sells for thinking that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Band at or the Apple Watch at are serious competition seems misguided The bottom line is Fitbit reported huge growth in the current quarter The companys pursuit of both the retail and commercial wellness market seems like the right strategy If the companys diluted share count declines by the end of the year investors could be pleasantly surprised In addition the companys average selling price should continue to rise while its component costs should come down over time The company will need to continue to innovate with new and updated products to maintain its edge That being said Fitbit seems to be hitting its stride Longterm investors may want to take advantage of the recent decline to step up and buy the stock We only use your
