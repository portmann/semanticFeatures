nonvolatile memory flexibleagnostic software wireless peripherals Cloud access demand Intel continues to take steps to profit from Moores Law by driving personal computing more mobile Xeon processors developed initially for Data Centers will turn mobile PCs into high powered precision workstations this fall Another step in profiting from more mobile computing will be mobile phones that serve as the core of your personal computing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Continuum Mobile Personal Computing Convergence describes Intel NASDAQ INTC at the end of and beyond This convergence will result in huge sales increases and profit margins for Intel Intel is likely to build for and achieve a leap over the competition as personal high performance computing dramatically increases at the mobile level Intels competition is approaching mobile computing processors from the low power and low computing ability side of processors Intel is approaching this convergence by bringing more mobility and less juice use to the high end computing side of processors My bet is that the Intel approach will win out over the competition Intel will become a huge producer of processors for what I refer to as super smartphones These super smartphones will have processors memory and communications in a single SOC System On a Chip I dont see any other company able to offer to phone manufactures a complete SOC with all necessary components and IP While this super smartphone SOC may be a year or more out there are clear signs of this convergence today More clarity regarding this convergence will be seen in Intel announcements during late starting with IDF August and ending in November with the Intel Investor Day This mobile personal computing convergence includes Smaller processors A few years ago it took a large desktop tower to do what a NUC New Unit of Computing can do now In a few years this level of computing power will be in a device that fits easily in your pocket Increased power efficiency A few years ago you could heat your office with the power used and heat generated by your PC tower Now powerful processors can run for hours on small batteries Intel is doing research to harvest power for computing from the devices environment Flexibleagnostic software <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Windows will recognize the device and take advantage of the device features automatically to optimize the user experience across all platforms perfect for more mobile devices Cloud access Cloud computing provides mobile device access to computing resources and big data across the globe and out to the edge eg Intel Gateway connecting IoT devices to the cloud Demand People are growing familiar with mobile personal computing with devices in their pocket and are expecting more each year The demand for more mobile computing will grow exponentially as Big Data and IoT grow in usefulness Many people discount and deride Intel efforts in mobile phones I agree that the Intel mobile phone bottom line results to date have been poor but I look at the Intel mobile strategy and see good evidence of a convergence in the near future The strategy involves developing the IP and products needed for where the mobile phone market is going not where it is now Super smartphones is where the mobile market is going and Intel is preparing for this market evolution Recently there has been a lot of discussion about NVM here and here so I will not be discussing this NVM more in this article except to remind readers that NVM close to a processor is a critical component of more powerful mobile computing I will focus below on other elements of this convergence Intel announced on Friday that Xeon processors initially developed for the Data Center are being reworked to turn laptops into workstations for engineers scientists editors designers and researchers in all fields This announcement is brief so it is quoted in full Content editors designers and engineers take note Intel is bringing the power of Intel Xeon processors to notebook PCs in a perfect balance between power and mobility Designed from the ground up for mobile workstations the Intel Xeon processor EM v product family based on architecture codenamed Skylake brings high precision computing horsepower to a notebook and supports key features like errorcorrecting code memory for enhanced reliability while running critical workstation applications The new products will be available with certified drivers for key engineering applications and support the unique hardwareassisted security manageability and productivity capabilities of Intel vPro technology Mobile workstations featuring Intel Xeon processors as well as Thunderbolt technology will be available this fall More information on the Intel Xeon processor EM v product family will be available soon Content creators designers and engineers get ready for more power and mobility To me the exciting part about this announcement is that we should see these notebook devices on shelves this fall and selling like hotcakes This is exactly the type of exciting PC product that will get high powered PC users to part with their money and buy a new PC This innovation will bring workstation power and features to laptops The new processors are aimed at power users They will bring mobility to the workstation The VPro group of devices will have the option to wirelessly and securely show the computer modeling or simulation from the laptop on a bigger screen Example Bring your laptop to a meeting and graphically show a comparison of gnomes real time I look forward to seeing some great HP and Dell devices along with a Mac Book Pro If these products are on shelves this fall sales will soar The earlier the better Using the computing power of smaller and lower juice use processors in mobile devices requires flexible and agnostic software The required software can now be seen in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>demos of continuum A recent article describes and evaluates continuum in some detail With continuum in some higherend phone models it will be possible to use your phone as a phone and a PC at the same time It would be possible for example to work on a spreadsheet on the big screen while talking on the phone playing a game or watching a video on the phones builtin display Higher end phone models will likely involve Intel processors that routinely perform multitasking and are now downsized and have lower juice use to function in smartphones The super smartphones described above will be made even more powerful with access to Big Data in the Cloud and data from the Internet of Things edge This is an area where Intel will benefit not only from being inside super smartphones but also from the sale of IoT devices IoT gateways and data center equipment Intel will be inside the personal computing device in your pocket the IoT devices throughout the world the gateways to connect IoT devices and the Data Center used to organize store and analyze Big Data IoT devices and gateways will be in every home office retail store warehouse manufacturing plant medical facility and transportation service Having access in your pocket to all of this data analytics will be useful in ways we cannot even imagine at this time A key to this mobile personal computing convergence is demand for greater processing power in your pocket Smartphone use has grown rapidly creating a device form thats ubiquitous Now that we have the pocket size form uses for this device will grow as it becomes more and more powerful with Intel processors The IoT and big data described above will grow exponentially over the next few years and mobile applications will be widely implemented to make use of Big Data and the edge The higher performance computing that Intel will bring to super smartphones will provide a huge leap in capabilities that will in turn increase demand for super smartphones At IDF from August to I expect to see and report on much more evidence of this mobile personal computing convergence I expect to hear announcements and see demonstrations of all the elements of this convergence described in this article Announcements will include more detail on new Xeon processors lower juice use and wireless progress on Atom processors D NANDXPoint W Continuum IoTCloud and user demand evolution As stock market analysts reach a higher understanding of this mobile personal computing convergence brewing within Intel and the likely resulting leap forward in Intel sales and earnings the stock price will rise As described in my previous article a significant increase in Intel stock price up beyond will likely require a shortterm increase in PC sales from W and Skylake Evidence of the far reaching convergence and the benefits to Intel will become much more clear at Intel Investor Day in
