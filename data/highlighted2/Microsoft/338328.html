style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to end the console war for good and might actually be able to succeed The individual pieces are in place but MSFT has struggled to execute similar strategies in the past Phil Spencer head of Xbox for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT recently announced the shift to Universal Windows Applications and a world of Xboxes with upgradeable hardware This would eliminate the need for console generations and convert Xbox into the same hardware utilization model enjoyed by PC gamers This is a huge shift in strategies and represents a unique opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to gain an advantage over Sony NYSE SNE In actuality this ends the console war which is already over in favor of the PS and shifts the competitive landscape <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be more at odds with Valve Softwares Steam platform Blizzard NASDAQ ATVI Software and League of Legends than the Sony PlayStation If successful this strategy could leave Sony behind depending on how PlayStation adjusts to the new market dynamics In this article I attempt to explain the nuance of this strategy as well as the pros and cons and what it means to Xbox in the future The typical and longstanding debate of which is superior PC versus Console goes something like this Consoles offer a closed system that is an inexpensive compared to PC gaming and reliable way to get into video games Software is specifically designed to work on the console hardware games generally run pretty well and there is little to no major troubleshooting or technical fidgeting to get things working Additionally the console offers about years of life where you do not need to worry about upgrading the hardware Developers generally design their games around whatever hardware limitations might exist Generally the console hardware is outdated at time of release compared to PC and by the end of the console generation the hardware is easily iterations behind what is available to the average consumer in the PC market On the PC side hardware costs are typically higher but the user is offered a range of flexible options and a very open hardware ecosystem that can be upgraded over time Games may or may not work on particular hardware depending on how outdated it is but if you want the highest definition experience you can upgrade into whatever works with your current configuration Also games are not tied to your specific machine and if you upgrade to something better you can take your library with you easily and play all of your old content Console games tend to be more expensive than their PC equivalents and more physical copies are sold on the console versus the PC which is dominated by various digital content delivery services Steam and other digital distribution platforms occasionally run crazy sales where incredible deals can be found at prices consoles rarely ever see Also the library of games that a PC has access to is far larger than any console library PC games can also include higher complexity that utilize the mouse and keyboard interface PC gamers have been known to call console users peasants from time to time In years past console exclusive software releases have played a major part in driving the sales of one machine over another but in the current generation the majority of games are released multiplatform with the major exclusion of any Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY or Sony firstparty releases For more information on the typical PC versus console generational gap please refer to the graphic below or this ExtremeTech article As you can clearly see in the graphic the PC performance graph takes a linear approach The console is more of a stair step by generation Essentially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is positioning itself to convert Xbox from the console line to the PC line The immortal Xbox strategy is clearly an attempt to convert the Xbox console into a PC gaming machine but the early indications are the universal Windows application Xbox ecosystem would be the only available content to play It is unclear whether MSFT would eventually open the Xbox ecosystem to the Steam library or other nonMicrosoft stores but it is highly unlikely as it would seriously damage Microsofts ability to sell software through its own content distribution service In theory Microsofts strategy makes perfect sense as the consolePC gap has been shrinking little by little every generation up to the present day where the Xbox One and PS are basically PCs in everything but name and operating system even less so on the Xbox One which runs Windows The concept of upgradeable consoles is not new and it has always failed in prior attempts if you remember the days of the bit era when Sega had the x and the bit era when Nintendo released the DD for the N Those consoles were far different than the current generation which offers digital downloads and far superior scalability of software If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>handles this correctly each game could have an upgradedowngrade graphics option depending on what level of Xbox it detected similar to the graphics option settings found in nearly every PC release This would be far simpler for developers to build around Currently Xbox One is far behind the PS in the console race This strategy shift could put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>back on equal footing and one up Sony slingshotting Xbox ahead after an upgrade cycle or two while the PS continues to chug on the original release hardware Sony will have a challenging time matching MSFTs strategy as it does not have the giant Windows OS installed base One option Sony could have would be a PS with full backwards compatibility and compatibility with the Steam Linux marketplace At some point in the future all the consoles could be technically streamlined Steam boxes that may have consolespecific exclusives as an incentive to purchase a particular brand There are some potential pitfalls to Microsofts strategy One issue will be the PC gaming user base is heavily invested into the Steam store as well as other specific individual platforms such as League of Legends or Blizzards various franchises Valve has a huge share of PC game digital distribution and owns a big chunk of the market share around These users will have a hard time abandoning their content libraries and open PC hardware to shift to a Windows store if the Xbox hardware restricts access Previous attempts by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to entice PC gamers into its content distribution platforms have not gone well Games for Windows was an abomination and the current Windows store also has major issues if it wants to compete If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>thinks gamers will flock to the Windows store and it does not release a Steamcompetitive content marketplace the effort will most certainly flop Also the console user base prefers the console experience for a reason it is reliable and inexpensive compared to alternative options Adding the complexity of some games not working or suffering from inferior performance without the right upgrades will further fracture the user base and turn off the average console user As I mentioned previously the console upgrade concept was attempted previously by Sega Nintendo and Atari and it did not go very well Perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can overcome the marketing and technical failures of previous generations but it should definitely be careful The PC gaming market is estimated to be worth around b If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>successfully implements its strategy it will give it a huge advantage in the next console cycle as the company will be removing Xbox from a headtohead battle with the nextgen PlayStation Bridging the consolePC gaming divide would be a major win if it was accomplished especially if a best of both worlds result gave us flexible and openended hardware with the reliability and ease of use of the typical console <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may figure out the Steam box before Valve does MSFT could finally be leveraging its native advantage of Windows OS installed base over Sony but we should be skeptical until further details of the strategy are revealed The fusion of the PC gaming market and console market will give access to significantly more potential users and a strategic edge to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that would not be easily duplicated by any of its competition Also Xbox upgrades could give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a future advantage in the VR space if it provides an easier or lower barrier to entry for average users Currently details are sparse but the future success of Xbox hinges on Microsofts ability to execute Be on the lookout for more news with special consideration for the content delivery restrictions and hardware upgrade specifics before placing a bet on the future of Xbox Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
