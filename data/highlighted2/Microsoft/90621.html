recently which was aimed at improving cross product cross division collaboration but should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>be looking to its actual platform as whole rather than looking to cut management Specifically Im referring to the companys SMBenterprise solution portfolio and the what I believe is apparent waste and inefficiency inherent in it For me the most obvious need for consolidation is between Project Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server also known as TFS Project is what it sounds like a project management collaboration and efficiency vehicle for general workflow Visual Studio in general inclusive of Visual Studio Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Code is a development environment for creating applications Windows Android and iOS web cloud etc that offers collaboration services and code editing capacity Its a hugely useful diverse use case platform as a standalone Finally TFS is a collaboration and lifecycle management platform for Visual Studio geared for development teams Put simply its a development team optimized project manager Now an argument can be made for leaving these asis and it would be a good one and I get it But the amount of capabilities crossover between the three of these is substantial and having an entire enterprise on one platform to me makes a whole lot more sense if the endpoint goal is to make Microsofts SMBenterprise suite the foundational platform in existence By the way this is clearly stated as Microsofts goal I recently heard the argument from somebody that I trust in regards to the space that developers dont want to use the same platform that could be used to plan a wedding his example and Project can be used for cases like that whereas Visual Studio cant but couldnt Visual Studio be an optional addon within Project I mean I just dont see how it makes sense to have different teams within one organization using different platforms Simply from a communication and collaboration standpoint that doesnt make sense Different teams within an enterprise will be using different terminology it just creates a barrier to both that I dont think needs to exist It also creates an excuse to use a nonMicrosoft platform think Intellinote or Slack Theres also the fact that quite possibly the best projectproduct management solution the company would be appalled if they knew I referred to them as a project company rather than product in the entire SMBenterprise space is integrated with TFS but not Project Im referring to Aha and yes Im serious its integrated into the much lower use case TFS but not the crown jewel Project platform Aha is the only worthwhile projectproduct management solution Ive used Intellinote is right there but its a projectcollaboration management solution pureplay and its trapped on the TFS platform Aha is a company with over customers including marquee names Samsung BBC EA Dell etc that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could presumably transition to Project with an integration something that it has learned is an effective acquisition strategy for its Power BI and Power BI Designer platforms This is whats confusing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and maybe this is the reason they let four high level managers walk today I mean how is it that this happens How is it that TFS and by way of intraMicrosoft platform integration Visual Studio which TFS rolls up to literally had to integrate Aha as a way to optimize platform product management capacity because as it stands currently nobody familiar with Aha is going to use TFS for product management theyre simply going to use Aha as an integration but nobody communicated this gem to the guys at Project Its all very confusing ProjectVisual StudioTFS employees take it from the Power BI and the Power BI Designer guys talk to each other Youll be better off for it So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to start axing something it should start with silos separating its core products on the SMBenterprise solution side not managers Remove the silos stop creating unnecessary use friction and reasons to use nonMicrosoft platforms and make it easier to be the foundational productivity suite in the space Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft
