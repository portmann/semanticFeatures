#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Dell has integrated its Statistica platform with Datawatch data visualization technology of which I believe to be the best in the business This makes Statistica an even tougher comparable and an even stickier platform when it comes to rip and replace efforts by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could integrate with Datawatch as well or simply buy the company to make its tech exclusive I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>must do one or the other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also has its much anticipated summer update for Designer and it has yet to be seen how that will shape the competitive space Its not time to panic on Power BI or Designer but the gauntlet hath been thrown by Dell who is aggressively trying to take market in BI and Design Just under a week ago I wrote an article about a then soon to be closing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Power BI Designer poll which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would use to finalize development of its summer update to the platform This will be Microsofts first major iteration update in a while as the company has moved smartly so in favor of the monthly burst updates its been deploying making smaller but more agile changes to the platform also to its connected Power BI platform I also opined that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should consider in conjunction with the summer update acquiring either via straight acquisition or licensing a best of breed BI data visualization technology as this is the majority of the updates promised One name in particular that I mentioned was Datawatch NASDAQ DWCH a stressed but best of breed data visualization tech provider It appears unbeknownst to me at the time that Dell formerly DELL had already realized the foundational need for data visualization as the basis of a valueprop for BI and Design platforms Dell had closed an integration partnership with Datawatch for its Statistica BI platform Statistica already was the single most used and turned to platform for cloudbased analytics projects according to Analytics and Business Intelligence in the Cloud a report by research firm Enterprise Management Associates EMA adding a best of breed data visualization integration that also allows for selfservice data preparation from structured and multistructured sources such as PDF and log files as well as realtime streaming data will only further its stickiness and use cases Being a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bull and a currently bearish leaning Datawatch analyst a company I have hammered in the past for poor management it pains me to plainly state that I dont believe there to be a comparable alternative If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt integrate with Datawatch to which the exclusivity of the Statistica partnership is unknown a real threat to the integration efforts I believe it will operate at a second tier when it comes to Design and visualization The facts are the facts regardless of my prior opinings and current feelings towards Datawatch management its solution is the best for what it does Dell today leapfrogs their competition with a combined solution that brings their advanced analytics together with the selfservice data preparation and visual data discovery that only Datawatch can deliver This offering provides a tremendous value proposition in meeting current and emerging analytics requirements Dell GM for Global Advanced Analytics John K Thomson followed with Today more than ever the ability of companies to compete hinges on using data to better understand the behavior of their customers and as such advanced analytics capabilities have become a must have for any organization including Dell Thats why we prioritized making such capabilities available to our customers and our company with the acquisition of StatSoft and in the year since weve continued pushing the envelope Dells new partnership with Datawatch in tandem with its aggressive crossportfolio integration efforts makes Statistica one of the most comprehensive easytouse advanced analytics platforms on the market today Again I have to agree entirely with both So is it time to panic on Power BI andor Designer I dont think so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still has a great platform combination and for those who arent needing to be professional data scientists the combination works excellent and has much much better aesthetics than Statistica It also has a huge surrounding productivity suite that creates a funnel to Power BI and Designer that Dell doesnt have Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has its upcoming summer update that needs to be evaluated prior to declaring a winner in this first round of shots fired All of these matter But for those long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>quite possibly and probably Tableau Software NYSE DATA longs should be paying attention as well the Statistica powerhouse is a monster that deserves close and steady attention I know Ill be more closely following the action on the private front at Dell going forward For now consider this an informational update to the competitive positioning of Power BI and Designer but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has its work cut out for it Thats for sure Editors Note This article covers one or more
