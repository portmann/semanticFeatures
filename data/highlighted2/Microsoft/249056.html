report that Windows tablet sales already posted a yearoveryear increase in tablet sales during the first nine months of This positive trend could continue well into the future The holiday shopping season could deliver Strategy Analytics estimate that Windows will grab of tablet sales this year Windows only had share in tablet sales last Q Some of the million Windows tablets that Strategy

positive development to offset its declining Lumia sales Investors should care that Windows tablets are gaining market share It helps ease the pain from the fact that Windows now has less market share in smartphones versus three years ago Steve Ballmers gamble in buying Nokias NYSE NOK phone business is panning out disastrously Microsofts billion writeoff of its Lumia business shows that Satya Nadella is pessimistic over Microsofts future as a phone hardware vendor He and I know that subsidizing Lumia phones is a longterm losing proposition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Strategy Analytics believes that Windows is fast becoming a premium OS for higherASP tablets Windows will allegedly gradually grab market share away from dirtcheap Android tablets The chart below predicts that Windows could get almost of annual tablet sales by From this year Windows share in tablet OS will supposedly grow to by Consequently the average lowerASP Androids share will dwindle to On the other hand this fouryear forecast of Strategy Analytics might still be lower than what Windows could gain in the future I reiterate my opinion that like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apple NASDAQ AAPL will also lose market share in tablets There are now more useful enterprisecentric Windows hybrid tablets like the Surface The Surface could render more expensive iPads very unattractive to business users I believe Strategy Analytics is incorrect in its prediction that Apple will still grow its tablet share from now to by This is contrary to current reality For the past two years iPad unit sales have posted doubledigit declines Aside from a serious price markdowns Apple has nothing left to make its iPad more attractive to consumers The Surface with <span

models of ARMbased iPads will continue to lose ground in the enterprise against cheaper Windows in alternatives I therefore guesstimate that iPads could lose market share by or more to Windows tablets Windows not iOS could have share in tablet sales four years from now The iPad Pro is a weak answer to the Surface ProSurface Book The entrylevel iPad Mini also has tough competition from highquality but cheaper Windows inch tablets like Xiaomis Mi Pad By virtue of its highmargin policy Apple is unlikely to match the pricing strategy of Xiaomi for Windows tablets The decline in iPads market share will likely continue well into also due to other factors Intel NASDAQ INTC is still willing to sell subsidized nanometer Cherry Trail Atom processors to manufacturers of Windows tablets Why Windows Is Growing On Tablets But Not On Smartphones Going forward I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to permanently let its OEM tablet partners thrive on lowermargin tablets and in laptops The reason why the Lumia business is dying is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>tried to compete with Android phones Thirdparty OEMs hate it when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>itself competes against their entrylevel and midrange products Microsofts future as a hardware vendor is to be more like Apple focus only on

phones The Lumia brand is now damaged goods due to it being associated with phones Surface is now the brand associated with premiumluxury hardware products MSFT is worth a longterm hold Windows growing market share in tablets is a silver lining in Microsofts struggle on mobile If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cannot make it big in phones the bigger need there is for it to improve its popular highpriced Surface product portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still needs a healthy tabletcomputer business to help it replace the lost
