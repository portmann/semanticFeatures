SSNLF by Lior Ronen Market dynamics structure and main players are slowly revealed as the VRAR markets approach Number of prominent vendors expected to control the VR markets hardware and software solutions Currently only two significant players compete in the AR market The expected rise of the virtual and augmented markets creates some investment opportunities As we are getting closer to the year when virtual and augmented reality VRAR technologies are expected to be available to the public more details are revealed about the evolving industry We now have a better sense of the softwarehardware strategies of the leading vendors as well as the relationship between them and the unique position some of them have already obtained In this article I portray the market structure dynamics and how investors could benefit from the evolving business Breakdown to Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality For a long while the virtual and augmented reality concepts were assigned together into one market with similar characteristics and dynamics Both tech ideas were put together because they are naturally adjacent to each other and the same software and hardware vendors have developed solutions for both technologies So it was easier to assign them together However now that we have much more information about the market the dynamics between the different players and the solutions that are expected to launch we can break down the VRAR into two separate markets with different solutions challenges and catalysts In the virtual reality market there is a large number of vendors developing VR headsets that are expected to be available next year The most prominent ones are the Samsung OTCSSNLF Gear VR the Sony NYSE SNE Morpheus the HTC OTCHTCXF Vive and the Facebook NASDAQ FB Oculus Rift which also powers Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Windows XBOX VR Headset For now virtual reality is mainly targeted at the gaming community as most companies revealed a long list of games that will be compatible with their devices In the augmented reality market or as it is sometimes called smart glasses there are currently only two prominent players Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL with the next generation Glass and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Hololense Both solutions offer users enhanced onthego features such as pairing their devices with a smartphone to receive calls text messages emails etc directly on their headset Also it will provide augmented search capabilities healthcare and fitness features realtime detailed GPSbased information on items within sight and a headmounted camera Currently it seems that Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will struggle to win over the VR market with their AndroidWindows OS that will allow them to expand their ecosystem into the gamingfocused VR market By offering a dedicated Android VR OS Google could generate revenues from VR games purchases on the Play Store while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could strengthen its Xbox and Windows ecosystem by allowing Xboxs users to stream VR games from their console to their Oculus Rift headset Microsofts announcement of the Oculus partnership might come as a surprise to some however as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is mainly focused on its AR solution it makes sense to partner with Oculus It provides an excellent solution that will attract gamers and allow Oculus to focus on its bigger challenge the AR headset The company is starting to look like the undisputed market leader of VR as it provides the VR solution for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Samsung in addition to its own solution which is expected to start shipping in On top of the three companies mentioned above one cannot describe the VR market without mentioning Sony Morpheus which is a VR headset that provides VR capabilities to Sony PlayStation which is similar to the OculusXbox experience Oculus and Morpheus are battling for console dominance in the VR world As mentioned above there are currently two main players in the augmented reality market that could control the majority of the market in the future Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>However they offer slightly different solutions Google Glass offers a nextgeneration smart device that will pair with users smartphones and enable them to catch messages onthego and enjoy the benefits of augmented reality content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offers a Windows based solution that provides users with the same smartphone interaction features as Google Glass however Holoense is expected to provide advanced holographic features on top of the augmented reality content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Hololense will allow consumers to stream content from Windows devices including Xbox which will allow dedicated games to use the holographic feature in Hololense Currently there are small vendors like GoldenI EyeTap and others who do not seem able to compete with Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The rise of the virtual and augmented reality markets offers many companies a onetime opportunity to grow their revenues dramatically if they succeed to catch the uptrend Google As the impact on Google might be marginal in the VR market the AR market revenues should be significant and expected to reach B in revenues in as I described in an earlier article Facebook In my eyes Facebook is the most attractive player in the VR market and has the most exciting promise with the Oculus Rift Luxottica NYSE LUX Italian eyewear company Luxottica will codevelop codesign manufacture and sell Google Glass Luxottica is expected to experience a sharp increase in revenues from this brandnew revenue stream Konami NYSE KNM Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA Activision NASDAQ ATVI As most VR devices are targeted at the gaming community VR game developers are expected to benefit from a sales volume surge As most of the leading game developers such as Electronic Arts Konami and Activision are expected to offer a VR version of popular games they might be a sound investment opportunity once they start announcing their titles for the VR market As we get closer to more information is being revealed about the virtual and augmented reality markets While very few players are expected to dominate each segment the rise of new technologies is expected to have a positive impact on some market vendors As we get closer to I will continue to cover the rise of the VR and AR markets and will publish a detailed analysis of the main vendors when more
