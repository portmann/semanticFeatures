Google Maps and Google Play could soon follow suit When Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Google exited the Chinese market in due to a soured relationship and censorship demands by the Beijing government it appeared as if it would be at least a decade before the company would even consider making a comeback But Google has already started making the first tentative steps to reenter the Middle Kingdom and could be only months away from making a full comeback Google is set to partner with Chinese Internet company Sohucom NASDAQ SOHU in Chinese Internet searches Google will conduct some of Sohus searches while Sogou Sohus search engine will screen the results According to the South China Morning Post other Google applications including Google Maps and Google Play are set to return to the Chinese market It appears as if Google will share the Sogou search partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT whose Bing search will be performing English search functions for the search engine By the time of its departure in Google owned about of the Chinese search market But with Chinese search giants such as Baidu NASDAQ BIDU and Qihoo NASDAQ QIHU now dominating the search space in the country in a big way Googles most realistic chance of breaking into this market lies in bringing Google Play to China Few if any American tech companies have enjoyed the kind of blowout success that Apple NASDAQ AAPL has had in China Although the Chinese market was not spared the capitulation after Apple recorded a YY revenue decline in the market during the Q FY the largest by any geographical region it remains Apples most important market ahead of the entire EU market Maybe that was to be expected from such a large market that has been growing at close to for several years In Apples hardware category only the Other Product category which bundles Apple Watch iPods and Apple TV recorded positive growth after posting a YY revenue increase to B Apples Software Service segment that consists of App Store Apple Music and iTunes Music Apple Care Service plans and iCloud storage plans has however remained a bright spot for the company During fiscal second quarter the segment posted revenue of B up from a year ago Services segment was the only Apple segment that added more than B in revenue growth during the quarter Now much of the success by this segment can be chalked up to App Store which contributes about to the Service category Although Apple does not routinely divulge App Store revenue numbers the company said that App Store revenue increased YY while generating more revenue than Google Play up from a lead a year ago according to App Annie And Apple has China to thank for the explosive iOS revenue growth iOS revenue in China grew x during the last quarter as China overtook Japan to become the second largest App Store market China actually overtook the US in App Store downloads during the fourth quarter of Inapp purchases of games is firing all this growth with games such as The Legend of Mir Westward Journey Online and Fantasy Westward Journey proving to be big hits in China Although the US still holds a sizable iOS revenue lead over China mainly due to better monetization of nongaming apps China is set to overtake it in a matter of several quarters if it maintains that kind of blistering growth clip The huge iPhone install base in China is certainly helping Apple Well Googles absence in China certainly appears to be part of the reason why Google Play continues to lag App Store revenuewise despite enjoying the lions share of downloads After all Android owns three quarters of the mobile OS market in China with almost everything else belonging to iOS Google Play recorded an impressive revenue growth in global entertainment revenue during the last quarter but still failed to match App Stores growth in this pivotal category partly because of its absence in the largest mobile gaming market outside the US India Vietnam and Pakistan in that order are Google Plays top three markets All top Google Play markets are emerging economies Can Google Play succeed in China I believe the company has a good opportunity to crack this market Although smartphone and tablet gaming generated B in China in just a sliver of this went to foreign developers due to heavy fragmentation of the Android market in the country with estimates that there are independent Android stores operating in the China Developing apps for such a market can be a nightmare especially for a foreign developer Not only do developers have to contend with an extremely fragmented market they often have to surrender more than half their app revenue estimates run as high as to to multiple Android channel partners compared to the standard cut by established platforms such as Google Play and App Store In fact a recent GamesBeat survey of gamers developer and publishers in China found that most players in the country badly want Google Play to return to the country Netease one of Chinas largest publishers is one of these Here is an excerpt from an interview between GamesBeat and a Netease executive Android is in a terrible situation From Neteases perspective we are happy if Google comes back Its good for publishers and developers And the Chinese government probably knows this So Googles return will help bring some sense of order to the Android market in China The presence of Google Play will be a breath of fresh air and will help to open up the market even further Google Play will easily become the exclusive goto store for foreign Android developers which means it will have a lot of content that wont be available in smaller Android stores in the country China might go a long way in helping double Google Play revenue over the next four years Which should help the company realize its goal to make Google Play and YouTube its chief growth drivers over the next couple of years But despite all the goodwill its likely to receive in China Google Play wont have a walk in the park there Tencent OTCPKTCEHY Chinas biggest Internet company already owns a giant app store in the country and is Chinas biggest publisher of mobile games Its ubiquitous WWWeChat app has helped the company overtake Baidu and Qihoo so Google Play will probably have to play second fiddle to Tencent for years Google might not be able to exactly replicate Apples success in selling mobile apps in China The company is coming into a mature market with local heavyweights that really pack a punch Nevertheless Google Play has an excellent chance to break into a highly fragmented Chinese app market and make good money while at it Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
