Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported its Q results after the market closed on The results constituted a sharp snapback from the disappointing figures reported for Q and the shares have rallied just about retracing the losses suffered earlier Microsofts guidance was a modest raise that was not particularly exciting The companys cloud revenue component reached to billion on an annualized run rate basis and that is now of revenue Cloud revenues could increase another this year The company has more cloud revenue potential than is acknowledged by many observers and hence its consensus top line growth and EPS growth as well is likely to be exceeded Who needs Windows or even LinkedIn when you have a beautiful view of azure waters and a blue sky speckled with puffy white clouds from your terrace The other day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT reported its yearend earnings for FY The results were to a greater extent considered the mirror image of the prior quarter Back then the shares fell about in the week following a disappointing earnings report In this case the shares in the midst of a strong rally in tech stocks have gained since the earnings call The shares now are essentially where they were months ago The IGV software index in that same time scale has risen MSFT shares have lost some alpha since the last earnings report and since the start of the year while the IGV has appreciated by about MSFT shares are up Much of the share price change recently has come in the wake of the announced LinkedIn NYSE LNKD purchase There have been many articles published on the outlook for that purchase by this author amongst others In the wake of the revelation that Salesforce NYSE CRM was a bidder for the LinkedIn assets many contributors felt that MSFT and its CEO Satya Nadella had been hoodwinked and that the merger would prove to be destructive of shareholder value Not to be cavalier but there are subjects beyond the LinkedIn acquisition that are going to have a more significant influence on the future of MSFTs share price Out of the many questions on the conference call only one mentions LinkedIn and did so in a peripheral fashion Discussing LinkedIn might be an interesting debate but the fact is that despite its billion cost it is unlikely to be dispositive in terms of forecasting the future for this company The purpose of this article as the title implies is to discuss the results of the quarter just reported and the outlook going forward I think under the circumstances speculating any more about the LinkedIn merger would produce more heat certainly not a commodity in short supply in metro New York and very little light I think it is reasonable to focus attention on the billion revenue segment of this company that has grown this past months and seems likely to continue on that trajectory I think the question on which to focus is whether MSFT can beat current consensus expectations and at some point resume doubledigit top line growth as its cloud strategy evolves and becomes a larger component of revenues for the company So that is what most of this article will cover The results were a beat against prior expectations Cash flow in particular showed strong growth and is probably the most objective metric issued by a software company The company did well in a number of key revenue buckets and did less poorly in other buckets than had been feared A significant component of the companys EPS beat was its low tax rate accrual as revenue outside of the US grew more rapidly than forecast which had the impact of moving earnings to areas of the world almost all of it these days with lower corporate taxes than is the case in the US Within the results as a whole there were some notable successes and a few clinkers as well Obviously the companys revenues from phones more or less collapsed and it had a difficult quarter in selling gaming devices Those items count but they are so small as to not be worth too much time in detailing As mentioned in the past this company is in the midst of multiple transitions and inevitably they do not all go well simultaneously And MSFT management takes its cue from the weather in Puget Sound well winter weather anyway in terms of its transparency There is plenty of fog in these numbers that permit many people to draw conflicting conclusions from the same data My take is that the growth components of this business are doing a bit better than the legacy businesses are declining and there have been a few surprises in terms of greener shoots within legacy businesses than might have been expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>these days has a reporting structure that makes it infeasible to comment about all of its business segments with any hope that an author can say something useful across the board I will confine my comments to what I think are important Overall I think the companys shares will be able to generate significant amounts of positive alpha particularly for a large cap tech name MSFT has been able to make some significant market share gains in a few key areas The ability MSFT has had to sell premium services within Azure ie data base and most lately security is one of those growth drivers that is dimly recognized that will keep giving for years to come And perhaps little recognized by some Dynamics which is the companys suite of integrated applications is also enjoying some visible market share gains as users migrate from onprem to the cloud The transition to what this company and others calls annuity models for desktop applications should be moving into its later innings Some of its newer growth initiatives are reaching scale that should allow for improved margins although not in QFY if one accepts guidance That is history which at this point doesnt tell us much about the outlook for the next months or years or whatever the relevant time period may be for readers And frankly neither do Microsofts headline results As I have commented in past articles MSFT has many unorthodox ways of presenting its earnings Unorthodox in the sense that other companies do not choose to make similar presentations and unorthodox in the sense that the presentation doesnt always display the companys progress or at times its regression To take two of the more glaring reporting anomalies most companies do not choose to call their revenue losses from a transition to a subscription revenue model a deferral and add it back to nonGAAP revenues and earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported EPS for the quarter of But included in that is derived from adding back the impact of Windows revenue deferrals to both revenues and profits is the number the company highlights and it is the number used by almost all analysts in their modeling and valuation work It is the metric the company reports and by which it is judged So despite my own issues with using it as a comparison point that is the number I have to use since it has been accepted without demur by most observers regardless of its unusual derivation I am to be sure a bit surprised that most people accept that unusual bit of financial legerdemain without comment It is no more and no less than the kinds of adjustments that most SaaS companies try to make for which they are often roundly pilloried But no matter the fact is that MSFT will eventually collect the amount of revenue that has been deferred The most impressive headline that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported was that Azure revenues grew this past quarter a not insignificant cohort of that growth was no better or worse than spin but the kind of spin that is all too common in the software world these days Dynamics is MSFTs application staff and its revenues grew Many contracts that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>signs these days include both Dynamics and Azure Indeed one of the most significant competitive strengths of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is the integration Azure and Dynamics But it can give a distorted picture of reality when the company chooses to report inflated revenue growth for Azure that is partially built on revenues that are really from the applications area Stakeholders in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are simply going to have to accept that not all of the numbers it prints mean the same thing as the numbers many of its peers use It was Archimedes who said years ago Give me a place to stand and I shall move the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt trying to move the world just to enhance its reported numbers and the source of its growth but the principle isnt far different All in MSFTs cloud revenues are growing by and have reached a billionyear run rate which is about of reported revenues this year That is the foundation from which to do further analysis As well as will be discussed further below in this article the companys cash flow growth presents a far more realistic and a better achievement than does the reported EPS enhanced as it is with a far from normal addition No this isnt some childrens fairy tale of some bold and moral knight rescuing his damsel from the wrath of an evil dragon Gartner chose the other day to release another research about the cloud and how it is turning the IT world upside down There is a reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>chooses to embellish the success of Azure even though doing so actually takes away from an understanding how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is using Azure Dynamics to enhance its market share in the IT space The Gartner report out today says that billion of IT spending will have shifted from onprem to the cloud this year and that by the shift will be no less than billion a year It is going to be increasingly difficult to be a credible IT vendor without getting the preponderance of revenues from the cloud Much has been written about the cloud by a great many analysts and contributors on this site I try to remind myself that the only relevance here is how to evaluate stocks No one ought to rely on this site as a guide for designing a new cloudbased infrastructure There are going to be winners and losers in terms of investment world from the cloud I believe that MSFT will be a winner Surely not an unalloyed winner but enough of a winner such that it pays to own the name This discussion would be much simpler if all the elements of MSFTs revenue mix were quantified in a simplistic fashion It would be much easier to see what appears to be happening if the revenue buckets were straightforward and consistent It would be nice but it simply isnt the case at this point Then there are other issues This article is written on Office that lives in the cloud How much of that revenue is counted in Azure and how much is personnel productivity or even what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>calls commercial Office On the last conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said that its Commercial Cloud revenues have reached billion as an annual run and would reach billion by Last years growth rate was more than or billion As revenues were flat last year the growth in commercial cloud had to overcome weakness in other areas particularly in sales of phones which declined sharply as the company exited parts of that business I think the use of growth and of billion ought to be the numbers to base most analysis since they are both straightforward and unambiguous Microsofts currently expected revenue growth is between and so the forecast for the growth of the commercial cloud is at least twothirds of the growth anticipated by the analyst consensus for the entire company of the overall commercial business that is subscription and continuing to rise Given the dynamics of MSFTs revenue categories it would appear that the companys overall revenue growth rate will be steadily rising as the high growth cloud revenues become a greater proportion of the total I believe that the biggest opportunity in terms of revenue dollars that MSFT is going to realize from the cloud is through selling its data base and security solutions to buyers of Azure For many years MSFT has quietly developed data base offerings and it has grown faster than the stagnant market as a whole But for the most part it has been locked out of the data base market by Oracles NYSE ORCL suite of database solutions Oracle has and continues to have a competitive data base It just cost a lot and these days Oracle expects users to pay for all the database seats that they have Quelle horreur There are a number of trends in the data base world that are outside the ambit of this article No SQL open source Hadoop etc But one trend that seems to be both durable and of some significance is that Microsofts data base brands are going to have a higher share of the world post cloud than was the case prior to the tsunami It is not an opportunity that is easy to tie down or to quantify but is one that is hard to ignore Oracle does have cloudbased data base products and will have more and better ones over time but within the segment that Oracle describes as IaaS even management has acknowledged that its offering can be and is being enhanced As users switch more and more workloads to the public cloud they need a database solution to support that transformation And very often users will acquire Azure and will acquire a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>database along with it Of course lots of users go with Amazon Aurora as well but I want to focus on MSFT and its opportunities rather than try to write about the whole cloud database market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also sells security solutions as part of the Azure suite of solutions and that too has become more and more successful It is a huge opportunity said to be worth billion in annual revenue by with a CAGR estimated to be no less than How does MSFT stack up in terms of share and trend in the space We really dont know precisely There are many other offerings in this space which some describe as Database as a Service DBaaS As mentioned earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is expected to grow revenues by next year to just shy of billion based on the consensus of analysts posting their estimates one way of meeting or exceeding growth targets It is my belief that a significant amount of the anticipated growth is going to come from the companys rising share of the overall database market and most importantly from the growth it is likely to enjoy in the DBaaS market Lacking a base trying to forecast any specific number is pointless but it seems like to reach at least billion in that business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also sells a product that it calls well Cloud App Security I dont think that Cloud App Security is going to replace the current generation of firewalls any time in the near future but it is another value added offering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>sells with its cloud And the company sells what it describes as Enterprise Mobility Services The cloud has given <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>far more solutions to sell than has been the case for many years and should start driving revenue growth noticeably in future years Public cloud services themselves continue their spectacular march upward IDC says that public cloud spending will reach billion by More than twothirds of that amount will be revenues derived from SaaS applications but that still leads more than billion of revenue that will be coming from cloud infrastructure products such as Azure Again given the size of MSFT and its expected growth it certainly seems that its public cloud offerings are going to be enough to give it a chance at beating current growth rate estimates And finally there is Dynamics Much of Dynamics for the cloud is very new and really it is too early to draw conclusions regarding just how large revenues will reach with high confidence In fact the latest incarnation of the product which is a bundle containing both CRM and ERP and is called Dynamics cloud bundle was announced just a couple of weeks ago and will go into general availability this fall CRM Dynamics has been growing at a significant pace for a few years now and it appears to be taking share from both Oracle and SAP NYSE SAP It is more or less matching the percentage revenue gains that Salesforce is achieving but given that the overall space itself is a subset of a subset the growth of revenue dollars while noticeable is in itself not sufficient to significantly move a target of billion Based on consensus forecasts from consultants it appears that CRM Dynamics product category might contribute the billion of topline growth expected for MSFT in FY One of the overall issues for MSFT and frankly for all of the larger companies who are transitioning their offerings to the cloud is to what extent there is cannibalization of the existing workloads and of course the existing revenue streams I do not think anyone would imagine that when a large company moves workloads to the cloud there isnt some kind of substitution in terms of replacing current workloads that are onpremise with those that will now be in the cloud But for MSFT which never had been a supplier to the largest users of a total enterprise solution the opportunities are far greater than the cannibalization And of course MSFT has never enjoyed the massive maintenance streams that make up much of the revenue of its rivals in enterprise applications When analysts and readers try to compare the record of MSFT to the record of Oracle SAP and even more so to the record of IBM NYSE IBM that is a very significant difference Oracle and SAP will transition many if not most of their users to the cloud and the same is true for IBM But what isnt going to happen is for those transitioning users to buy a greater percentage of their compute requirements from their legacy vendors In the case of MSFT just taking a look at the two high profile wins that were discussed on the conference call the exact opposite is the case GE NYSE GE in particular has been an erstwhile Oracle poster child and probably will remain an Oracle customer at scale but it is now using many MSFT cloud solutions as well That is the real difference and frankly at the end of the day it is one of the longerterm reasons why MSFT is a winner in this transition which will ultimately lead to rising growth rates rising margins and support a rising share valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is reporting that Dynamics overall is growing at or there about these days and that is nothing about which to get very excited But as Dynamics shifts more and more to the cloud my guess is that its growth and its market share will start to rise visibly although this is hardly embodied in the growth expectation that is currently the top line consensus or the growth expected in fiscal either ERP and the associated financial apps are perhaps the single most boring topic about which to write in enterprise IT When I was young depending on where one went to school punishments for misconduct might consist of writing a catechism times on the blackboard or at a different kind of school ones creativity might be stifled in some equally creative fashion ERP software is not much different than that It was old when I was young and we have both grown older together But it is a huge revenue opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>along with NetSuite NYSE N or Ultimate NASDAQ ULTI or Workday NYSE WDAY and I think it is one of the opportunities that MSFT has to exceed top line growth this year Basically the numbers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has provided suggest that the cloud has provided something greater than billion of overall revenue growth in It is hard to imagine that number not growing and not growing significantly in I think that overall the cloud space and the ancillary products and services that make up the segment can readily contribute billion to the MSFTs growth in the current year and more beyond that The worldwide ERP market is supposed to reach billion by and it is forecast to enjoy a CAGR from now till then with the growth of cloudbased ERP significantly above that level of CAGR At the moment MSFT is said to have a market share in ERP of It has the most to gain at least in dollar terms of any vendor as the transition to the cloud continues and indeed accelerates Last quarter overall Dynamics booking grew by more than while Dynamics CRM seatadds doubled year on year and paid seats have increased year on year And finally the growth in Office Commercial is perhaps quite surprising to some observers Last quarter seats grew year on year and revenue grew in constant currency which is a function of the E bundles that the company has sold and which presumably will be enhanced by the new E bundle which is just starting its ramp There are obviously going to be takes in looking at revenue growth The transaction based onprem server revenue will decline it is simply a question of how much and in which quarters The faster cloud revenues and other annuities streams grow the more rapid the decline in transactional sources is likely to be And again the faster the transition to cloud the greater the amount of impact on what MSFT describes as support agreements in Enterprise Services really Maintenance But when trying to deconstruct the buckets of MSFT revenue the odds seem high at least to this writer that MSFT has a significant opportunity to beat the very modest and revenue forecasts that make up consensus revenue growth And at the end of the day I think that is enough of a reason to recommend to investors to buy the shares to achieve positive alpha If Commercial Cloud revenues are going to be billion this fiscal year what is happening with the other billion Even in the modern world billion of revenue isnt chopped liver More like foie gras than chopped liver Foie gras with a glass of sauternes perhaps Restaurant Daniel in New York recommends Chateau Suduiraut which is surprisingly reasonable at bottle Oh well I got diverted for a moment Food and wine easily do that to me As mentioned earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has chosen to report its revenues in a number of buckets that transcend more orderly productoriented presentations I am not going to attempt to review all of the segments that this company reports because it will not provide any insights into growth or competition or margins For those readers interested Seeking Alpha makes the slide deck that details many of the metrics MSFT reports readily available In the interests of space economy I will simply touch lightly on some of the more significant revenue growth drivers Bing query share in the US has reached Search advertising revenues grew by year over year Cortana which is both the PDA optimized for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>devices and for Windows as well as the name that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has given its advanced analytics functionality has seen fairly decent revenue growth again observers are left guessing exactly how much The companys Surface family of products is also showing decent growth within the context of its space Overall Surface revenues showed growth last quarter and the company is forecasting a continuation of that trend over the next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a product offering that combines Cortana with something called HoloLens so users can talk to the device and tell it to take pictures as instructed Just this side of frightening Another product called Surface Hub an interactive white board after long shipping delays is apparently garnering some attention I doubt that the sum of all of these products is going to produce substantial revenue growth but it is always possible that one or the other of these opportunities might move a billion goal if one looked hard enough billion goal not likely but say you never know We really have no idea as to the precise revenue contributions of these products Frankly I am never going to talk to a camera but apparently this is something of significant interest to many millennials who are quite willing to anthropomorphize their devices and even call them by name I am not driven to use interactive white boards but then again I do not work in a large corporation Not too surprisingly device revenue dropped by overall primarily because of MSFTs exit from the lower end phone business Phone revenues dropped overall and will continue to drop by that amount until they reach an anniversary in more quarters Gaming revenues were down for MSFT because people played fewer games and I have no idea why that might have been <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>sold far fewer gaming consoles at lower prices and that was the bulk of the revenue decline Overall MSFTs gaming revenues dropped by Gaming revenues are now less than of the total revenues for MSFT and while it would better for gaming revenues to increase rather than from a financial standpoint the change is scarcely more than a rounding error Again betraying my age I suppose I have no idea why people find it fascinating to spend hours in front of a game console but apparently hours spent gaming showed a sequential increase on Windows equipped PCs I am sure most readers were just pining to know that statistic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>currently has a market cap of billion and an enterprise value of billion With the consensus sales expectation for this year right at billion which is up by all of from the just reported FY year that is an EVS of X MSFT does not explicitly guide for fullyear revenues and hence by definition it doesnt guide for fullyear EPS either I think as I tried to present above that there is every reason to believe that the company is positioned to exceed the current consensus growth estimates of and respectively and by a noticeable amount The consensus nonGAAP EPS forecast for FY is which would be up all of from the printed this year So that is a forward PE of X Again I would be inclined to believe that there will be some positive leverage if the revenues for the year exceed consensus estimates as I think likely at this point As mentioned above the nonGAAP EPS number will be significantly buoyed by reporting annuity windows revenues as though they were taken upfront It is an unusual practice but seems to have been completely accepted by analysts without demur In terms of traditional valuation metrics the significant jump in cash flow is most noteworthy I believe Overall cash flow from operations reached billion in this past quarter up by from the prior year That is a cash flow margin of more than up from in the prior year Free cash flow increased by a smaller percentage primarily as the result of a massive buildout in cloud infrastructure CapEx rose by almost year on year but despite the outsize growth in CapEx free cash flow still grew reaching billion For the past year the companys operating cash flow was billion That was a cash flow margin of a noticeable increase from reported for fiscalyear I like to look at one metric which relates to comparing free cash flow to reported operating income the conversion rate some call it Cash from operations last quarter was billion and it was billion for the year Operating income for the two respective periods was billion and billion respectively That yields conversions rates of and respectively Even the free cash flow ratios which come to and respectively are far higher than such ratios for most other software vendors These are excellent ratios which really speak to the fact that MSFTs profitability is more than meets the eye Lots of investors do not pay the attention to cash flow that is warranted when looking at the valuation of software vendors One can adjust reported free cash flow any way that may be desirable but I will just stick with the reported numbers and the free cash flow yield The free cash flow yield based on the free cash flow of billion for fiscal represents a yield of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>doesnt forecast cash flow at any level There are trends that will lead to greater realization rates going forward Ratable revenues will over time have the tendency to produce a higher level of cash flow that is onpremise revenues The CapEx required for the Azure infrastructure will tend to decline per dollar of revenue and the MSFT CFO Amy Hood has forecast lower CapEx for that purpose explicitly A higher proportion of ratable revenues will lower AR ratios If you put these numbers together it suggests that free cash flow is likely to increase between in the current year At the midpoint that would bring the free cash flow yield to over an excellent level for most companies and a great level for a company such as MSFT that has a significant expectation for substantial earnings growth in future years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported earnings that were a significant snapback from the disappointing results of the prior quarter about a week ago The shares are still valued at modest levels and do not reflect some significant growth opportunities that are becoming more and more visible The companys overall cloud revenues which have reached billion on an annual run rate basis are growing and by themselves might be expected to account for more than growth expectations in this current year The company has seen a very rapid growth in cash flow and free cash flow that appear to be ignored by the current valuation of the shares A free cash flow yield of which I think is credible based on overall projections for FY would be one of the highest free cash flow yields to be seen in the enterprise IT space The company should see declining CapEx requirements as it has completed a substantial part of its Azure infrastructure build out The company has made significant progress in converting most Windows users to the cloud and a subscription basis While its reporting of that accomplishment is unusual it is nonetheless something that will tend to augment the growth of cash flow in future periods The company has significant opportunities to improve its market share in areas such as database security and applications as more and more mainstream customers move to the cloud and have the opportunity to reconsider their vendor choice as they make the transition With more and more revenues coming from annuity sources the visibility and the stability of growth for MSFT ought to increase Obviously like all companies in the midst of transitions there are going to be quarters such as Q when some stars do not align and the company does not achieve its expectations But in looking at fiscal as a whole I think the odds are highly in favor of the company beating most of the time and beating by a noticeable amount And given the modest level of valuation that is enough of a reason to warrant a purchase recommendation I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Application Software Editors Picks </div></body></html>
