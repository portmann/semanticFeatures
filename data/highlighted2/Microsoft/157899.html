NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Default privacy settings of Windows allow more indepth data gathering Windows is now being used on more than million computers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has implemented a more aggressive personal data gathering strategy in Windows This might boost the companys online advertising unit There are now more than million people using Windows one month after it was released The freemium tactic of giving away free Windows OS updates is now addressed by Microsofts heightened appetite for user data gathering After installation the default privacy settings of Windows allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>access to a generous amount of personal data of users Millions of ordinary PC users are unlikely to tinker with the default choices on the different pages of privacy settings in Windows I opine that Microsofts personalized ads business could soon match the sophistication of Googles NASDAQ GOOGL data mining and ad targeting capabilities Googles often intrusive personal data scrapping made it very successful in delivering highlypersonalized ads With Windows s more open personal information sharing features Microsofts targeted ads products might become more palatable to digital advertisers Microsofts hyperlocalized ads offering is now more powerful because the Location option on privacy settings of Windows is turned on by default Unless a person takes the time to probe into the different privacy settings options of Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could mine information out of him in more than a dozen ways The many avenues that Windows can funnel user information through to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has even prompted enterprising people to sell software that allegedly will disable Microsofts data gathering tools Imitating the aggressive approach of Google toward user data gathering is a necessary evil that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>must do The freemium approach of giving away free software and services goes handinhand with advertising Consequently Advertisers prefer providers who can give them the most extensive set of personal information The more people who install Windows and not disable the data tracking tools the better chance there is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would steal advertising clients away from Google As of now Google thanks to its omnipresent search engine dominates the online advertising business The worldwide estimate for digital ad spending this year will reach billion Search ads will account for billion Search advertising will even grow into a billion industry by Unfortunately Microsofts Bing search engines global market share is less than while Google has more than Advertisers covet Googles AdWords advertising platform because of its allinclusive data mining advantage The more aggressive default privacy settings implemented in Windows is likely intentional It helps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>improve Bings databank on people and their habits The deeper Bing can delve into and record peoples browsingshoppingcomputing habits the more chance there is that advertisers will consider Bing Ads over Googles AdWords <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also does not own a successful social networking site It is even overshadowed by Facebook NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR when it comes to digital advertising Hopefully the generous default personal information sharing feature helps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>create a minisocial network out of the million people that now use Windows Like how Facebook gather personal data on its site the Windows system apps default access to messagingSMScameramicrophonecontactscalendarphotosmusic on Windows computers is clearly to help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>gather more information on people Microsofts decision to not support thirdparty browser extensions in the new Edge browser is also favorable to digital advertisers Edge is the default browser in Windows and its lack of support for thirdparty extensions makes it immune to the threat of uBlockAdBlock Plus Savvy advertisers who are not happy with Googles approval of AdBlock Plus uBlock on the official Chrome Web Store might find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Edge the better choice for browserspecific browsing historydependent advertising Digital advertising is not very efficient when browsers like Chrome allow people to installuse adblocking extensions Edge is the successor of Internet Explorer Different versions of Internet Explorer still support adblocking browser extensions I hope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>keeps adblocking browser extensions away from Edge If Edge achieves the same level of mainstream usage that Internet Explorer global share now enjoys <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can offer advertisers a haven that is free from adblocking software I approve of the shift toward adsupported freemium business model Advertising unlike selling commercial software is not vulnerable to piracy I like the default openness of personal information sharing on Windows Exhaustive data mining is just part and parcel of Microsofts shift toward freemium People who use free softwareonline services still pay for them by sharing their personal information Microsofts nonsupport for thirdparty extensions on the new Edge internet browser is also a big step toward attracting more advertising clients A healthy growth in annual advertising bookings is highly desirable Aside from the fact that software is prone to piracy the rise of competent free alternative operating systems and productivity programs endangers commercial software sales Google enjoys a bigger market cap than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>This is in spite Google relying on advertising not on sales of software or hardware Adsupported freemium strategy might therefore also help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>win the approval of investors who now value Google at x or higher PE Disclosure I amwe
