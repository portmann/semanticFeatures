Portfolio She normally gets in stocks per month but with her birthday in June it is Applying the rules of the Pink Portfolio on DIS In our first article of the Pink Portfolio series I laid out the purpose and rules of the Pink Portfolio I summarize here My wife and I are the proud parents of a wonderful almost twoyearold girl When you have children the ideal moment to start investing is from birth But as is the case with many middleclass people we dont have thousands of dollars to invest for the apple of our eye We decided to put aside about a month for her that we can use to create a portfolio Every month I will buy some stocks and I will update the state of the portfolio here on SA I chose to call it the Pink Portfolio because that is her favorite color For special occasions she will sometimes get more than And this month is such a special month Our little sweetheart celebrated her second birthday on June th This means that this month there is a budget of because we also deploy the money she got from her godfather her godmother and her grandparents For those who would wonder of course she did get other presents as well besides money from those wonderful people shoes a horse stick a toy wheel barrow and a lot of other toys I took a picture while I was making the cake but I forgot to take one of the final result Now there was one theme that our little girl really really wanted Mickey Touse Dont ask me why but if she sees Mickey Mouse she keeps repeating Mickey Touse She learned to know Minnie Touse as well and she liked Minnie even better because Minnie is always in pink our daughters favorite color as I have just mentioned So there were Minnie Mouse paper plates Minnie Mouse napkins and Minnie Mouse plastic triangles all over the kitchen for her birthday party She also got a pink sweater with Mickey Mouse on it for her birthday so what could be a better buy than Disney NYSE DIS as a second stock for her Pink Portfolio But does it fit the principles we follow to build the Pink Portfolio Lets check The first rule is very simple the stock should be under per share because we want to buy every month I already mentioned in the comment section of the first article that I use a discount broker which means that I only have to pay for every transaction With a share price for DIS of a bit under there is no doubt about this criterion PASS The companies I invest in for our girl must be safe For the credit rating I want A or higher except for some special situations Disneys SPs credit rating is A so this is good enough I also think that this debtequity graph shows clearly that debt is no problem for Disney especially compared to its competitors Nike the other holding of the Pink Portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Johnson Johnson to put things into perspective because these are the only two companies that have an AAA credit rating For the Pink Portfolio I want a risk number under preferably under and that is not a problem for Disney which seems to be quite safe at It is between its biggest competitors but even lower than Nike our first stock for the Pink Portfolio which had The credit rating the ratios and the Nasdaq risk tool all point in the same direction Disney is a safe investment I want stocks in the Pink Portfolio that are undervalued or fairly priced with a maximum premium of for top stocks Lets see how Disney is holding up here I will look at different opinions about the stock value Simply Wall Street provides an intrinsic value based on future cash flows The conclusion is that Disneys fair stock price is while its current price is That is an overvaluation of just so this already fits in my template because I consider Disney as a top stock Of course this is just one method As a lot of you know valuation can differ a lot depending on the method that is used Morningstar has a four stars rating on Disney which means that it considers the stock quite attractively valued According to this FAST Graph DIS has a current PE of and a year average PE of which indicates again that DIS seems to be fairly valued This is for the first time since the beginning of You could also look at the competitors in the sector for the valuation The biggest competitors for Disney are Comcast TwentyFirst Century Fox and Time Warner DIS PE Ratio NYSE TTM data by YCharts As you can see Disneys PE ratio is lower than that of FOXA and CMCSA and higher of that of TWX If you take the average of the PE of those competitors you get and DIS is below that Again this indicates that DIS is fairly valued A dividend discount model NYSEARCA DDM is also an often used valuation tool for dividend stocks You can do that yourself but stockanalysisonnet has done it for us We see a fair value of which means DIS would be overvalued by again well within our range According to finvizcom the average target price of the analysts is which would mean a bonus of a bit more than All used models to valuate DIS point in the same direction DIS is more or less fairly valued now So PASS Future return value or growth quality I want either a good dividend or high growth or a mix of both for the Pink Portfolio Disneys growth prospects are in the low double digits but a growth stock should have per year or more so then DIS should be a value stock The question is then of course is it a good value stock Disneys dividend rate is which means a yield of with a price of For dividend investors this doesnt seem to be very much but if you look at the dividend growth you see that the quite low yield is because the stock price goes up together with the dividend In the afterdays of the crisis the dividend was kept equal But since the average dividend growth rate is per year That is quite spectacular The fact that Disneys yield is still only just means that the price of the stock went hand in hand with the dividend Disney is a dividend challenger on the list of David Fish with a year streak of yearly growing dividends It must be said though that Disney is not the average dividend company For example they do not pay out quarterly but semiannual And even that is only since last year Before that Disney paid its dividend annually Disney has room enough to pay out growing dividends According to finvizcom Disney has a pay out ratio of only and its expected earnings per share growth for the next five year is This means in my opinion that Disney has years of double digits dividend growth to come I even think that the raise that FAST Graph assumes for every year is conservative First because Disney will probably make its pay out ratio higher and secondly because Disney also buys back its own shares which means that the company can divide the rising amount of dividends over fewer shares According to gurufocuscom Disney has a year share buyback average of Conclusion I wouldnt be all too surprised if you have a YOC of or higher in years time The Chowder Rule says that if a stock has a dividend yield of less than its fiveyear dividend growth rate plus its dividend yield must be or higher Disney has a Chowdernumber of according to David Fishs CCClist If I take the average from onwards I get yield which is a clear PASS Even with a small amount of money you can build a portfolio especially with a long term horizon For our little girl I am building the Pink Portfolio Over time will keep coming and the Pink Portfolio will keep growing Time will be its biggest friend The first buy was Nike I have bought shares in May and I have averaged down and bought more with our girls birthday money I have also bought two shares of Disney which I analyzed in this article I feel good about those two holdings not just because these are solid companies with years of growth ahead but also because of the personal touch As I told buying Nike was partly because our little sweetheart likes her pink Nike sweater so much And as for Disney she cant stop jabbering about Mickey and Minnie Touse Long after she will have learned to pronounce the name properly she will be proud to own a tiny part of the Mouse House This is how the Pink Portfolio looks like after the first two months with the extra cash from her birthday Disclosure I amwe are long DIS NKE I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation
