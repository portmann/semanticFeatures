</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is offering limited time cashback incentives to people who buy new Windows laptops and trade in their used computers including MacBooks Microsofts Easy Trade Up promo offers up to cash back for tradedin old Windows computers The US and UK are covered by the Easy Trade Up campaign I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to also expand this program to other countries soon While Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is busy implementing a contra revenue strategy to attract more corporate subscribers for its Google Apps for Work product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is busy propagating its Windows business Microsofts newlylaunched Easy Trade Up program is a contrarevenue style of incentivizing people to replace their old computers with new Windows laptops The Easy Trade Up cashback promotion was made available for US and UK customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offers cash back to people who buy new retail price of or higher Windows laptops and then trade in their old Windows notebooks and allinone computers The only requirement is that tradein computers should be working and they should only have normal wear and tear from a maximum of six years of usage Qualifying tradein products are MacBooks iMacs any brand of Windows laptops and allinone desktop computers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>clearly values old Apple NASDAQ AAPL computers and will give a cash back if a customer will trade in an old MacBook or an iMac The US offer for Easy Trade Up expired Tuesday However I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to repeat this promotion in the future I also look forward to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>expanding the Easy Trade Up promo to include other countries like the Philippines I have five year old Wintel laptopsnetbooks and one MacBook that I would love to trade in for new Windows computers Yes it costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to do cashback promotions However it is a major helping hand for its OEM partners Cash back promos help OEMs sell more of their latest Windows notebooks and in products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has every reason to help top PC vendors like Dell Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY Acer HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ and Asustek OTCASUUY achieve better sales numbers Making sure PC vendors preload their new laptops and desktop computers with Windows is easier done when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>helps them become more attractive to customers The reality now is that there are OEMs who ship out Linux OS laptops and PCs because it helps them retail at lower price tags Let us not forget that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still not offering free Windows licensing for new computers The only free offer for Windows is for people upgrading from older Windows computers they own Aside from accepting money from thirdparty companies to preinstall their software on new computers OEMs desperate to make money on razorthin margins on sub computers are also often willing to ship them out without a commercial OS like Windows Microsofts overall strategy to build up a billion strong Windows ecosystem is in great jeopardy if its OEM partners find it difficult to sell new Windows computers I opine that an undesirable consequence of Microsofts decision to offer free upgrades to Windows is that it inspired many people and companies to stick to their old Windows and Windows machines The PC industry continues to decline PC vendors clearly need some contrarevenue effort from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to revive the flagging sales of PC products Sad but true <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>codedoptimized the Windows OS to run efficiently even on year old computers with only GB of RAM The limitedtime cash back offers in Easy Trade Up is therefore just a way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to encourage people to also upgrade their hardware not just their operating systems The contrarevenue tactic in Easy Trade Up is justifiable Instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>spending too much money on advertising it is more effective to attract customers to buy new Windows computers if they could get cash back from their old computers The Easy Trade Up is a timelimited promo so I expect it not to cause figure operating losses like what Intel NASDAQ INTC incurred in its tablet application processors campaign <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will also be able to recoup some of its cash back expenses through advertising and possible Office subscriptions from the people who availed of the Easy Trade Up promo Furthermore the contrarevenue in Alphabets free Google Apps for Work offer to current Business Office subscribers was a necessary move because Microsofts Office went from in to market share in in the allimportant enterprise market Google Apps which enjoyed market share in enterprise cloud software last year only managed to grow to this year Microsofts exemplary deployment of Office as the top choice for enterprise customers within a years time makes it a strong buy The robust revenue growth from recurring enterprise subscription to Office gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a lot of extra money to spend on cash back promos for Windows computers of its PC vendor partners Earlier this year Okta reported that Office was the
