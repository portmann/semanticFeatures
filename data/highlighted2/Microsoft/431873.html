Seeking Alpha It seems to be a consensus and I align with it that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might have overpaid for LinkedIn But one must look at this deal from the perspective of the acquirer to understand the opportunities Scanning through the news and articles about Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT acquisition of LinkedIn NYSE LNKD today consensus seems to be clear the price tag on the deal might have been too high But to understand the acquisition by far the largest in MSFTs history one must look at it from the perspective of the acquirer and try to see the opportunities CEO Satya Nadella wrote a letter to his employees today In it the CEO makes it clear that above all he is looking at the LinkedIn acquisition as a way to reinvent productivity and business processes In other words the deal is an attempt at vertically integrating workplace solutions by being present at the many different stages of the professional cycle At an individual level it starts with preprofessional networking and the job search areas in which LinkedIn has been dominant as the leading professional network platform for a while now But then it continues with professional development through LinkedIns Lynda and most importantly with the integration of productivity tools including Microsofts Office SharePoint and Skype A sales representative at Company XYZ for example who originally found his or her job through LinkedIn could not only generate sales leads through the same platform but also manage calendar MS Office meetings Skype and share documents SharePoint more seamlessly provided that the many tools are properly integrated without ever having to leave the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>umbrella of products and services all with a single sign on In the end the hypothetical salesperson could very well have an allMicrosoft experience in the office from am to pm and never have to seek or encourage his or her employer to seek workplace productivity solutions elsewhere Source graph compiled by DM Martins Research Credit to thinkstockphotoscom At the enterprise level LinkedIns platform could not only serve as the recruiting tool that it already is but it could also combine with Microsofts ERP enterprise resource planning system MS Dynamics to allow clients to better manage their employee and client databases This most recent attempt at vertical integration in my view is strategically Microsofts version although much subtler and less novel of what the company managed to accomplish by introducing MS Office IE and Windows x in the first half of the s The companys idea back then was not necessarily to offer the best available operating system or the best word processor and spreadsheet combo or the best web browser Microsofts products might in fact have been inferior to others available in the market purely from a technical perspective The idea instead was to offer the personal computer user a completepackage solution that would keep him or her hooked to the brand and coming back for more Strictly from a strategic perspective I can find arguments to support the MicrosoftLinkedIn combination This is not to say that the path to monetization from the deal is clearly carved but the pieces could potentially be arranged in a way that create value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The problem in my opinion lies first and foremost in the price The LinkedIn acquisition is by a long stretch Microsofts biggest acquisition billion vs runnerup Skype Technologies at billion In fact LinkedIn was priced this morning higher than Microsofts multibillion dollar acquisitions of Skype Nokia mobile phones and aQuantive combined The billion price tag values LNKD at over x the companys EPS much higher for example than Facebooks NASDAQ FB x Twitters NYSE TWTR x or Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL x If you factor in the million in FY pretax SBC sharebased compensation expenses into the equation LinkedIn is now valued at an astonishing trailing PE of x I believe this last metric to be much more insightful since LinkedIn has had a history of compensating employees lavishly with company shares and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will need to find a solution either through cash payroll payments or share dilution to retain top talent from the acquiree In terms of the premium paid on the acquisition LinkedIns while a large number at first glance actually compares favorably to many other of Microsofts large acquisitions in the past or so years Still billion in goodwill seems like a sizable chunk of cash to be paid for the professional network company Lastly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will still have to deal with the same issues LinkedIn had been facing prior to the acquisition announcement Both revenues and MAU monthly average user growth had been declining as of late perhaps an expected phenomenon as most companies would be pressed to sustain revenue and MAU growth rates at or levels for very long And as I highlighted on my most recent LNKD article all of the companys GAAP operating expenses from SM to RD to GA have been rising faster than revenues over the past years With the closure of the acquisition and the integration efforts probably dominating the meeting agendas over the next years at least I wonder how much effort LinkedIns leadership team will be able to devote to these equally important issues Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Macro View MA Technology </div></body></html>
