is dealing with the fallout from a lack of investment in the years prior to his CEO appointment Under Tim Cooks leadership Apple has returned RD spending to historical norms BlackBerry serves as a model for how management can burn shareholders in the name of excessive misguided spending Apple should avoid that fate Apple NASDAQ AAPL and how it chooses to use its capital remains a point of serious contention among investors Ive highlighted how Im supportive of Apples buyback plan and even want it ramped back up to levels but many investors want to see more money poured into research and development and capital expenditures Apple needs to invest in the business is the line That desire isnt completely nave To some extent we are all worried about what the future brings for Apple And even the most ardent of Apple bulls acknowledge that smartphone revenue is showing some signs of topping and the next big thing for the company seems far off in the future When the future is hazy like it is now kneejerk reactions inevitably happen What I intend to do here is to give a gentle reminder to investors what led Apple to where it is today how it has historically allocated its resources and why throwing more money at the problem may not necessarily fix Apples woes Ah I was in college Beyonce was at the top of the Billboard Top maybe that has not changed and then Senator Barack Obama was poised to take his place in the White House The man didnt have a single gray hair back then Of course something else more relevant to the discussion of Apple occurred in We were blessed with a product that would change or indirectly influence the way many of us live our lives forever the iPhone Apple from this point forward would precede to grow its revenue at a annual pace through its fiscal propelled by the success of this one consumer electronic device and its eventual reiterations Total research and development outlay in fiscal leading into that product launch Just M In an amazing use of capital what was likely just several hundred million in total research and development outlay turned out the first example of a device that would eventually generate hundreds of billions in profit You cant beat that return on investment and historically this is how Apple has always operated The company has always been characterized by when compared to peers very low spending allocated toward research and development Traditionally research and development costs have run below of revenue even stretched back further than what I have pulled above Compare this to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT RDRevenue spending at in its fiscal or even notoriously stingy IBM NYSE IBM at of revenue That being said the slump we saw heading into the period likely contributed greatly to the lack of new product availability that we see today Taking a project from initial concept to eventual commercial development takes years and I have the feeling we are now in the period where we would have seen the fruits of investment from that period was a period of massive growth for Apple where revenue more than doubled from B to B Even Steve Jobs and his team were likely taken aback by the quick success of new product launches and were a little slow in adjusting to a vastly changed business environment Focus was likely elsewhere likely on structuring Apple to handle its new superpower status in the business world Jobs illness may have even played a part Its unfortunate but nothing can be done about that now As far as the change in spending patterns that began in this also roughly coincides with the timing of Tim Cook taking over as CEO For as much criticism as Tim Cook has gotten in the public media for mismanagement of Apple in recent months he has presided over a massive ramp in Apples development efforts Nominally during Tim Cooks tenure this increase in research and development spending is large from B in to B annually in Even beyond research and development capital expenditures investments in longlived assets like property and equipment are up from B in to B in However like most things in business payoff takes time and investors need to have patience in seeing results from the ramp in spending Apple Spending More Now Wont Solve Its Problem So why not spend even more today Its important for investors to remember that you cannot force innovation Spending for the sake of spending gets you nowhere Just as throwing money at problems in your personal life rarely works it also rarely works in the business world as well Companies need to hire the right people who will make the right decisions all by properly weighing and considering all available options that come out of research To get products to market quickly weak projects need to be culled early so focus can be directed where it could be most beneficial The more rapid the change in development spending policy the more it is likely that company direction and motivation gets muddled For an example of a company that has struggled with research and development spending we can take BlackBerrys NASDAQ BBRY malaise as a guidepost The recent peak in BlackBerrys revenue came in fiscal which saw RDrevenue touch This was above peer norms and all seemed well Despite being a much smaller company at the time Blackberry was pouring almost as much money into developing innovation as its larger competitor Apple However revenue began its slump as Blackberry products fell out of favor and Blackberry proceeded to dump money into trying to figure out how to slow its revenue decline RDrevenue has now been driven toward annually as the company continues to try to figure out how to remain solvent B was spent on research and development in that fiscal timeline and this spending drove a large portion of the earnings per share losses that have plagued BlackBerry shareholders for years Has all this spending done any good for the company At this juncture no Revenues are expected to fall once again annually to B in the companys fiscal Shareholder value has been destroyed and the company would have been better off liquidating the assets it had five years ago rather than chasing a viable solution to saving its business that does not seem to exist For those of us who are worried about future innovation Tim Cook has pushed Apples research and development spending well above levels that were present when he took over the business For those of us who are worried about management throwing money at a perceived problem and degrading shareholder value he also has just moved Apples spending back to historical norms I personally find Apples spending in this category to be just right at face value although I have no clue on how efficient the returns on that spending will be in the future Given the discount on Apple shares in the market currently Apple doesnt need home runs Singles and doubles over the next decade to maintain current free cash flows would point to the shares being deeply undervalued As investors sometimes we just need to sit back and let management do its job and have the patience to wait for what product release surprises might lie around the corner Apple is actually one of my few large cap holdings For more research on contrarian plays on deep value companies such as this bottom call on Wynn Resorts in
