shows a smartphone with Windows operating system at the CeBIT trade fair in Hanover in this file photo from March SEATTLE Microsofts plan to make its new version of Windows a mobile hit by letting it accept tweaked Apple and Android apps has met an obstacle some of the software developers the company needs to woo just arent interested Windows phones accounted for just percent of global smartphone sales last year compared with about percent for devices with Googles Android system and percent for Apple and its iOS system according to research firm IDC One reason is that Windows doesnt run as many or as attractive apps as its rivals To boost sales of its phones and new operating system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said last month that it would provide tools to software developers to make it easier to design apps for Windows based on apps that run on Android or Apple But because so few people use a Windows phone most developers remain focused on the more popular systems and dont see a need to develop apps for Windows They also said they doubt how easy the new tools will be to use Windows phone will have to gain a significant share of the market before this becomes something that saves us time andor money said Sean Orelli a director at app development firm Fuzz Productions in New York which makes apps related to Citibank the New York Post and Conde Nast among others For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the worlds biggest software company theres a lot at stakethis summer as it rolls out Windows the first operating system designed to run on PCs tablets and phones If developers dont embrace the new platform it will seriously damage the prospects of the new operating system which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hopes will power one billion devices in two or three years Interviews with more than a dozen developers found just one planning to move an app from Apple or Android to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>MSFTO Thats Kingcom which ported its popular Candy Crush Saga game from iOS to Windows with very few code modifications and will be installed automatically with upgrades to Windows according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Kingcom confirmed the move but declined to comment further Eight developers said they arent planning to develop for Windows at all Four who already have Windows apps said they would continue to do so Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hasnt actually unveiled its new set of tools to turn apps into a Windows format developers did not rule out any move and a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>spokesman said that it is still early and many software companies want to explore the tools over the coming months More and better apps might attract more people to buy a Windows phone or tablet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reasons Only six of the top free apps on iPhone are available for Windows phone and of those two are made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>itself In the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has paid developers to create Windows apps Failure to attract the apps would not be fatal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which is growing more reliant on its Office server software and cloud computing services but it would be a sign that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is losing its hold on personal computing in a world where phones are expected to outsell PCs by more than six to one by Because of that trend its going to be hard for developers to prioritize building for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said John Milinovich Chief Executive of URX a mobile ad service that creates links between apps Windows closely tied to the stagnant PC market is a big but static business for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Its likely worth billion in revenue this fiscal year analysts say compared with almost billion for its Office business out of total expected annual revenue of billion The companys server software and cloudcomputing businesses are growing much faster with cloudcomputing revenue forecast to triple to billion by Even though only a handful of developers have been allowed a sneak preview of the new tools <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>says its preparing most doubt it will be easy to take iOS and Android apps to Windows Concerns include how the Windows app will use batches of prewritten software called libraries that an app needs to run and the prospects that Apples new language called Swift may soon eclipse the current one Erik Rucker head of mobile at Smartsheet which makes an online tool to manage projects said he doesnt plan a Windows app version He doubts tweaking an iPad or iPhone app for Windows would be simple Wed end up writing a whole bunch more code to move over an Apple app that was tightly integrated with the device he said For Jason Thane general manager at General UI a mobile app developer based in Seattle the cost of developing a Windows app from another system would need to fall to about percent to percent of the cost of building it It can cost percent or more of the cost to develop an app on one platform to port it to a new platform said Thane who hasnt yet used the new tools So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a way for our customers to do it easily and cheaply and if theres no serious performance or functionality impact I think theyd have a lot of people wanting to do it Even a little extra effort is too much for some smaller developers including former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>executive Adam Tratt who now runs Haiku Deck which makes presentation software primarily designed for iPads Id like to at some point but were not working on it yet he said Its a function of resources Recent history hasnt been on Microsofts side Last year Pinterest pulled its Windows Phone test app and this year Chase and Bank of America stopped supporting Windows phone apps saying few customers were affected None of those companies would comment on plans for Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does have some loyal supporters Walt Disney Co DISN Netflix Inc NFLXO and USA Today all confirmed they are developing apps for Windows USA Today owned by media giant Gannett Co GCIN is building a universal app for Windows which will run across PCs tablets and phones But instead of reusing code from its existing Windows apps or porting from Apple or Android the development team opted to start fresh The best experience was always going to be achieved with tools made for a given software system said Christopher Kamsler manager of mobile development at Gannett and even with those his team had to tweak the app to work for different sized devices Its an uphill battle for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said
