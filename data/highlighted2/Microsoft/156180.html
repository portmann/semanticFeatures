#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>started the hardware shift with the Surface new Windows smartphones are the next step <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office has always been a cash cow Office seems poised to take this to the next level Its the year and it has been an interesting last few years for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Three years ago the companys business was beginning to change with roughly of its revenue generated by the Commercial division On the Devices and Consumer side Microsofts Surface XBox and Office businesses were the star performers In things have become very different Microsofts cloud business is the main driver of revenue as its Commercial business now represents more than of the companys total There have been some challenges along the way but overall investors are pretty happy with the end result In Satya Nadella Microsofts CEO made the difficult decision to take a huge write down of its Nokia investment In addition he essentially said the companys current smartphones werent good enough Specifically he said the company would generate new growthon our own differentiated firstparty premium device portfolio Many investors read inbetween the lines and realized this meant the company would release its own smartphones for Windows A few years before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>surprised many with the first Surface tablet Investors were skeptical that the software company could compete with the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPad and the slew of tablets running Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android OS Though the Surface RT was a huge misstep once the Surface came out the tide began to shift In Google was focused on YouTube and its search business With YouTube viewership rising by yearoveryear and paid clicks up in the middle of the year Google was keeping its investors happy Apple sold over billion worth of iPads but with revenue and units down on an annual basis the focus was on the iPhone and the Apple Watch In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>introduced the first Surface smartphone Knowing that it had to compete with the likes of the iPhone S and the Google Nexus X <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>went big The first Surface phone had a Ultra HD display a quadcore processor GB of RAM and or GB of storage Where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really won the day was in making two things happen First unlike the Nexus and the iPhone the Surface phone supported Micro SD cards up to GB Second the company finally made porting Android apps to Windows Phone apps an easy process for developers This was a watershed moment as developers finally could get on the Windows app bandwagon In the app store for Windows sits at over The gap between the three big ecosystems has finally begun to close With only about of the global smartphone market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a long way to go However keep in mind Windows had less than market share in One thing that hasnt really changed in is the fact that consumers and businesses use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office as their productivity suite In Office was beginning to gain significant traction as consumer Office subscribers topped million On the commercial side Office was slowed by the Windows launch but once businesses realized that Windows was a solid upgrade Office commercial grew by leaps and bounds Three changes in the last few years have really solidified Microsofts hold on the productivity business First in Apple decided to shutter its productivity suite Though hard core Apple fans loved Pages Numbers and Keynote these software products no longer fit Apples hardware core business Second in late Google decided a free productivity suite no longer made sense The company was making so much money on its selfdriving car technology and from YouTube subscriptions that giving away Google Docs was no longer good business Third by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>finally managed to fully integrate Cortana and Skype into Office With voice commands through Cortana to accomplish simple tasks and Skype for realtime collaboration Office has become an even bigger cash cow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>than before Investors love the stability of the companys subscription revenue model and constant updates and new features keep users happy The future is cloudy and thats a good thing Microsofts biggest transformation has been the growth of its commercial cloud business In the company generated about billion in annual cloud revenue Somewhat surprisingly by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>surpassed its goal of billion in commercial cloud revenue The companys deep knowledge of CRM has helped its Dynamics CRM Ultra business to explode In CRM was a billion market and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had only a small part of the pie Today CRM is a billion market and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>owns Microsofts reputation in the cloud computing space has helped Azure become a monster business for the company In fact between Office Commercial Dynamics CRM Ultra and Azure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>posted an annual run rate of billion in commercial cloud revenue based on the second quarter of It hasnt all been roses for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>on the path to Windows wasnt that well received but Windows seems to be a strong upgrade When the second iteration of Surface smartphones came out the Surface X was compared to the Zune media player When Apple released the Apple Watch with a screen that expanded to but could be folded to wear on the wrist all of the smartphone industry shuddered When Apple announced the price would be some of these fears were lessened That being said Microsofts Office is now the undisputed leader in the industry The companys commercial solutions are well regarded and Microsofts Commercial revenue growth of billion in the last three years is remarkable This significant revenue growth combined with impressive margins has led the company to earnings per share of nearly As investors have realized <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has become a growth story again the PE multiple has expanded to
