overhaul are also discussed Intel launches server CPUs optimized for cloud video and virtual PCs Intels NASDAQ INTC new Xeon E v processors are based on the companys recently launched nm Skylake architecture come with an integrated Iris Pro GPU and support a new video transcoding solution called QuickSync The chip giant argues theyre ideal both for doing HDK online video transcoding and streaming it observes video now makes up nearly of web traffic as well as for delivering quality graphics experiences in remote desktop virtualization environments they involve PCworkstation deployments in which servers handle the processing and storage and have seen growing enterprise uptake due to their IT management and security benefits Intel claims a Xeon E v processor can handle up to realtime p streams at framessecond The chips take aim at Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA whose Grid GPUs have been deployed within data centers to power virtual desktops and enable cloud gaming services Virtual desktop usage benefits Citrix NASDAQ CTXS and VMware NYSE VMW the PCapp virtualization software markets top players Nvidia gets good reviews for GeForce GTX GPU Nvidia first announced the in early May along with the more powerful MSRP both are based on the companys nextgen Pascal architecture While reviews show the soundly outperforming Nvidias Titan X GPU its prior flagship model the shows just slightly better performance on average with the Titan X occasionally winning However the costs far less than Titan X MSRP at launch time originally did Not a bad priceperformance gain in months time and one that together with the s performance cements Nvidias highend desktop GPU dominance ahead of the expected late early launch of a Pascalbased Titan GPU BGR declares the might be the best value proposition in PC gaming history if youre willing to pay for a graphics card anyway GameSpot With a percent delta between it and the GTX the GTX certainly isnt as fast as its big brother but it also costs roughly percent less When you compare it to the Titan X its up to nine percent faster and up to percent cheaper Thats a crazy good deal With PC sales weak and AMD Incs NASDAQ AMD processors designed into both the PS and Xbox One Nvidia seems to be betting on increasing the addressable market for highend PC GPUs capable of K and VR gaming both by launching new aggressively priced GPUs and cutting prices on older parts rather than maximizing the profits it reaps from its existing hardcore PC gamer base Nvidias gaming platform GPU revenue rose YY to M of total GPU revenue in the April quarter Facebook is planning to show ads to nonFacebook users on other sites shuttering its LiveRail video ad exchange unit Facebook NASDAQ FB already shows plenty of ads to Facebook users on other sitesapps through its Audience Network which was on a Byear revenue run rate in late Facebook gets a cut Its now planning to use cookies and Facebook sharing buttonsplugins the latter can send basic info about browsing sessions regardless of whether someone is a Facebook user or not to deliver targeted ads to nonusers Interestingly Facebook thinks the mountains of data it has on its own users can per the WSJ help it spot patterns in peoples behaviors and better infer what a nonFacebook user might be interested in based on a relatively small amount of information The company has long argued its reliance on Facebook user IDs for targeting lets it better target users across devices than display ad rivals relying on cookies such as Googles GOOG GOOGL AdSense and DoubleClick platforms Meanwhile Facebook is pulling the plug on its LiveRail unit which it bought for a reported M in and which allows publishers such as Hulu CBS and the MLB to create private video ad exchanges that can deliver targeted ads leveraging Facebook data The move follows LiveRail layoffs and the expansion of the Audience Network to support brand video ads on thirdparty apps and sites Facebook has also recently announced its shutting down its FBX exchange which via ad partners controlling the targeting data shows PC Facebook ads based on browsing activity on other sites The common thread between all the moves Facebook is restructuring its ad operations towards solutions for which the company directly controls the targeting and delivery of ads and collects all related data and lets it cut out middlemen in favor of directly interacting with advertisers and ad agencies Facebook would prefer to be the one interacting with advertisersagencies but the company seems OK with letting publishers do so with the help of Facebook data if theyre intent on it Its hard to question the companys ad strategy or execution right now Ad revenue was up YY in both Q and Q CNET Apples Amazon Echo rival could

developed and that it could use a camera and face recognition technology to detect whos in a room and adjust its behavior accordingly The site cautions Apple could change its plans to include a camera or even scrap the device entirely One simple explanation for the differing reports Apple is still figuring out what its home assistant solution will look like after having recently decided to offer one in response to the Echos success Google appears to be scrambling to offer an Echo rival as well The company showed off its Google Home assistantspeaker two weeks ago even though it hasnt yet

humanoid traits see Bostons popular YouTube videos for proof for the US military and others No word on the sale price Bostons sale wont spell the end of Googles robot efforts the company is still developing robots through its Replicant initiative and targeting end markets ranging from homes to factories to hospitals Rather the sale would be about shedding a unit that from the looks of things wasnt a good cultural fit Bostons RD approach appears to resemble that of many defense contractors whereas Google has typically gone with a more collaborative approach and preferred to release products more quickly and then later fix bugsshortcomings in response to user feedback Google gives core iOS app better performance instant article loading sports video clips The company remains intent on giving mobile users as many reasons as possible to use Google Search as well as integrated services such as Google Now and the companys revamped voice assistant service and thus avoid solely relying on mobile apps to get whatever they need It has updated its popular core iOS search app simply known as Google to provide faster launch and query times instantly load news articles supporting Googles AMP project somewhat resembles Facebooks Instant Articles and deliver NBA and NHL video highlights Another incentive for Google to drive usage of its core iOS app Google keeps all of the ad revenue from searches performed with it or for that matter with the iOS Chrome app whereas it gives Apple a large cut for search ads clicked on via Mobile Safari Now on Tap Instant Apps and

details new licensing solution ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH has launched the CortexA a new flagship CPU core promised to deliver a increase in performance and power efficiency relative to the priorgen CortexA used in many highend mobile devices It has also launched the MaliG a GPU core said to deliver a performance gain and increase in power efficiency relative to the priorgen MaliT and to often outperform midrange laptop GPUs With smartphonebased VR solutions such as Googles Daydream platform and SamsungFacebooks Gear VR headsets suddenly all the rage ARM talks up the ability of the cores bound to be used by processors going into dozens of smartphonetablet models to deliver superior mobile VR and AR experiences for devices But the CortexA will also likely find its way into the server CPU market where ARM licensees such as Applied Micro Circuits NASDAQ AMCC Cavium NASDAQ CAVM and AMD are trying to take share from Intels dominant Xeon line Here the erosion of Intels historical manufacturing process edge by ARM partners such as TSMC NYSE TSM could help out Separately ARM has shared details about its new Built on ARM Cortex Technology licensing solution which for a price lets chipmakers modify Cortex designs with the help of ARM employees Its meant to be a simplercheaper alternative to taking out a costly ARM architecture license and developing an ARM CPU core from the
