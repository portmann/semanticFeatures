class='textDiv'>Intel Inside Xiaomis Upcoming MacBookLike Linux Laptop Intel Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Chinas top vendor of smartphones Xiaomi is reportedly working on releasing its own laptop product Xiaomi will allegedly use a custom version of the Linux OS for its first inch notebook The worlds fourth largest smartphone vendor no in China Xiaomi is again rumored to be coming up with a notebook PC The supplychain sources of Digitimes reported yesterday that Xiaomi will launch a laptop in China next year Inventec and Foxconn are helping Xiaomi develop a inch laptop that uses a customized Linux OS It will offer highperformance but will sell for less than in China The decision to use an open source OS is likely because Xiaomi will not never get approval from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to modify the Windows operating system Xiaomi was only able to develop its custom Android MIUI ROM because of the Android Open Source Program AOSP project I now speculate that Xiaomis laptop will use an Intel NASDAQ INTC x processor not an ARMbased one The price point claimed for the Xiaomi notebook insinuates it will have at least the same CPUGPU build of the consumercentric <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface The tabletnotebook hybrid Surface uses Intels latest nm Atom XZ tray processor My theory that Xiaomi will likely use an x processor is also because Intel has emerged as the top contributor to the development of the standard Linux OS kernel As we can see from the chart below Intels opensource engineerscoders contributed codes to the Linux kernel more than x the contribution of ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM which supplies ARMbased processors to Xiaomi phones is not even among the top contributors to Linux kernel development Intel is obliged to make sure its xx processors deliver the best compatibility performance on Linux computers Intel makes billions out of supplying processors to server farms Linuxs share of the lucrative enterprise server market was already since early On the consumer level Intel has been diligent in issuing updated software drivers All the top laptops reviewed by experts with the best compatibility performance with Linux OS are using Intel processors Xiaomi if it wants to makes its laptop competitive against established brands like HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ will also need Intel processors to ensure enhanced Linux compatibility To avoid future customer complaints a Xiaomi Linux laptop needs to be compatible with the most amount of thirdparty hardware printers scanners USB peripherals etc and software Another motivation for Xiaomi to use x processor on its Linux computer is its compatibility with Wine Wine is a Windows application compatibility layer software that lets people run Windowsonly software and games on Linux computers Xiaomi even if its uses its own custom Linux operating system will still find it prudent to make its laptop compatible with Wine Aside from gaming purposes many Linux computer owners use industrystandard Windowsonly software from Adobe NASDAQ ADBE and Autodesk NASDAQ ADSK The screenshot below reveals that many creative professionals like using Windowsonly graphic software on Linux laptopsdesktops using Wine The economic benefit to Intel from Xiaomi expanding its empire to notebook PCs is very obvious Xiaomi is now a globallyrenowned brand that rivals the iconic charm of Apple NASDAQ AAPL Xiaomis initial success came from selling sub highend Android phones that look like iPhones The rumor before was that Xiaomi was developing a copycat version of Apples highend MacBook Ai which touts Core i processor and GB of RAM However a dual approach of selling both entry level and highend Linux Xiaomi notebooks is something I would expect from Xiaomi This company had tremendous success selling Android phones in China The same nondiscriminatory approach could also be applied by Xiaomi to its future PC products Unlike Apple who only focuses on affluent buyers Xiaomi is brave enough to cater to all sorts of customers Selling a Linuxpowered clone of the MacBook laptop is possible with the tray Intel Atom XZ processor The MacBook uses the more expensive tray GHz Intel CoreM processor Xiaomi needs Intel to make it big on notebooks The winning advantage of Intels x processor architecture is its universal native hardware compatibility with Linux Windows Chrome OS Android and Mac OS This is something that RISC ARMbased chip producers has yet to match Event the smartest geniuses at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had to create a special Windows Mobile OS version because most Windows phone today are stuck with Qualcomm Snapdragon ARMbased processors INTC is a Buy Winning Xiaomi as a longterm processor client would certainly boost Intels PC chip sales There are millions of lowmiddleincome Chinese buyers that will snap up a sub MacBook clone from XiaomiGlobal expansion of this product is also a possibility Apple can continue to sell its laptops to affluent customers and Xiaomi will target buyers who can only afford price tags Apple has persistently tolerated Xiaomis habit of copycatting its phones and tablets I therefore expect Xiaomi to get away again with a Linuxpowered replica of the MacBook next year As per the report of Digitimes Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY will be the one who could suffer from Xiaomis entry into notebook computers Lenovo currently has share in Chinese laptop sales Xiaomis expert use of the hunger marketing strategy for its phones has helped it trounce Apple Lenovo Samsung and Huawei in China Xiaomis global smartphone shipments for Q is also greater than that of Lenovos Xiaomis brand power is now strong enough to expand smartphones Intel also still benefits in the end even if these two Chinese OEMs also starts slugging it out in the notebook PC category Lenovo the worlds largest PC vendor is also a loyal client of Intel processors In fact Lenovo was one of the first OEMs to integrate Intels RealSense D camera to its consumer Z and Z laptops last May Lenovo again used Intel processors and RealSense D cameras inside its new ThinkPad E series of business laptops Xiaomis alleged Linux laptop could imitate the designaesthetics of the MacBook but Xiaomi might also imitate Lenovos decision to use RealSense Camera on the Z Geeks already proved that RealSense technology works on Linux computers Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a
