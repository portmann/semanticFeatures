tech site CRN Apple NASDAQ AAPL has begun using Googles GOOG GOOGL cloud infrastructure IaaS platform and has significantly reduced its reliance on market leader Amazon Web Services NASDAQ AMZN which it has used to help run iCloud and other services Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending MM on the Google Cloud Platform CRN says it isnt clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure spends Byear on AWS The report comes three weeks after Spotify which has relied on both AWS and its own servers announced its migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropboxs Private DROPB efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a homegrown infrastructure relying on a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language not something many companies have the resources to pull off Aside from Spotify known Google clients include Snapchat CocaCola Best Buy and Sony Amazon still towers over the IaaS market while Google is viewed as or behind Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and perhaps IBM Synergy Research estimates Googles IaaS and cloud app platform PaaS revenue totaled less than M in Q Amazon reported Q AWS revenue of B YY Michael Fraser head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps argues Googles huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings possibly an incentive for Apple given the amount of download activity it handles and that its platform per InfiniteOps tests delivers better performance than that of any major rival Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything theyre doing and when you take into account their various incentives Amazon closed down after slipping in the wake of CRNs column the Nasdaq rose and is down in afterhours trading It is not bad to buy your initial business to gain a reputation But Google is obviously not some startup Since the beginning of the year more than databases from many hundreds of companies have used an early version of its migration service said AWS vice president Adam Selipsky You can clearly see that were now getting into the meat of enterprise adoption of the cloud Yes Glen The issue is margins All of these companies GOOG AMZN and IBM have economies of scale The challenge is that is getting easier and easier for customers to spread their business out among different Cloud SPs and easier to migrate applications from one to another with the click of a mouse On one side of the coin its a massive business opportunity On the other side margins will get capped which is why investors need to consider valuations IMO it is about market share and NOT margins today It is a land grab right now Amazon was well ahead of the game Gary Come on do you not remember the case tool days when we just pushed a button and all our code was written for us If Google is using this as a ploy to data mine my activities when using Apples cloud services I will be migrating to another manufacturer I do not want any of my data stored on Google servers and will be shutting down my iCloud backups I may also be compelled to migrate off of Apples email also I have to agree not interest in any of my limited data being stored on Google servers I tend to store all my information my computer My company switch from Outlook to Gmail for corporate email and services We were told Google did not data mine corporate email but no one could explains how ads were showing up on my personal home computer which I never use gmail or any other google services was showing me ads based on emails in my work gmail account What I do at work is completely different than what I do at home and the ads that should up were for companies I worked with at work and the only way for Google to know I had some relationship with those company was to read my work emails I know Google at some people made a connection between my work computer internet searches and my home computer however in the case of these companies I never did any searching about them on the internet at work or at home I tell people about this all the time you can not trust what Google is doing with your data on their servers what an uneducated comment Blind fanboyism wont get you far away Obviously google is not data mining But yes your data will be stored on google servers What are you going to do Stop buying apple devices now We switched Google mail at work also and have noticed the same thing happening I get ads showing up in my email for services related to my work also Everyone in my office has noticed this It is creepy and never used to happen on our old mail system I once worked for a major outfit that insisted that we use gmail accounts I refused on account of a NDA that I signed with another company disclosing to a third party in that case Google sensitive information People need to realize that google is not a common carrier They have access to every morsel of data that you store on their computers and they will use that data to their advantage In some cases that could even mean to their own proprietary advantage Most corporations and people generally would like to know at the very least if the FBINSACIAetc is snooping around in their data But when one outsources to say Google those threeletter agencies can use secret warrants to examine data without even tipping you off to the existence of such Mark You just laid out the reason why you should use Google Since Google makes their money leveraging information there is ZERO chance they would ever sell it Agreed Garrrrlic Azure is no slouch either I would have guessed the relationship with Amazon could have been more synergistic than with Google Amazon has always offered the best deal Google recently closed a deal for Qualcomm chipped ARM operated Servers with fast memory and bandwidth for HPC Cluster Servers and Networking They save a whole lot of money over Intel are cheaper to maintain and run far more efficiently so yeah Google is getting ready to blow the competition out the door with lower priced cloud services and storage Sources tell CRN LOL This is at least levels of hearsay which makes it inherently unreliable Why spread what you know are only unconfirmed rumors Lets see Amazon basically is financed for free by the markets equitywise Apple has a PE of what or so Apple is just using Amazon and now Google as a form of cheap offbalancesheet financing for functions of their business that theyd otherwise have to commit equity Smart for Apple Kind of dumb for Amazon and Google And if Google is winning business from Amazon they had better a major technologicalcost advantage in providing service Otherwise theyre subsidizing their customer Apple ETF Screener Search and filter by
