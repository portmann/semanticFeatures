style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has announced Power BI has integrated with new partner Alteryx Alteryx is a followon addition of missioncritical business management functionality following Microsofts recent VoloMetrix acquisition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>while helping its new partner Alteryx also is going to make a run at Alteryxs customers in that no other Alteryx BI partner has a complete softwarehardware ecosystem If you missed out on the big <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT device event a few days ago you might want to catch a recap video or spend some time breaking out what all was announced because the device story directly plays into the softwareplatform story at the company I know that sounds obvious but with CEO Satya Nadellas vision of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>understanding the connectivity of everything the devices the productivity suite the general software spectrum etc is huge In fact its everything That is the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The oneplatform oneexperience across devices cureall to the need that confronts you At least thats the goal Along these lines a few weeks ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>dipped its figurative toes into the waters of helping run a business for its users Now Im not talking about providing the productivity suite that helps run the business Office and all its variations etc but the actual systems to make underlying business decisions Things like hiring and firing like managing productivity of human capital like managing collaboration across teams This is something thats becoming more apparent by the development device announces software updates partner integrations etc as hugely important to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>market share capture strategy Was this ability available to users prior Sure I guess To powerusers who knew exactly how to funnel Microsofts overall capacity into what they needed from it maybe But thats not good enough for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that level of low visibility and access So it bought VoloMetrix an organizational analytics startup with a unique tech Analysis of the acquisition has been linked above And the VoloMetrix purchase plays as everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is doing these days into the broader picture that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is trying to express and illustrate At full integration VoloMetrix will make the productivity suite a better solution for a wider base of users it will make the productivity suite more efficacious and it will bring its own valueadd to the ecosystem as a whole that it didnt have prior <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would love to continue to find ways to embellish other tools efficacy with VoloMetrix or any other part of the ecosystem especially if that tool is its allimportant Power BI This weeks Power BI ecosystem partner integration should help this goal as well as help embellish the valueadd of VoloMetrix Dont think thats coincidental either the timing that is Power BI has announced that it has partnered with Workflow engine Alteryx I wasnt all that familiar with Alteryx prior to the announcement but after chatting with a friend in high frequency trading in Chicago Ive come to find out that Alteryx Workflows are incredibly powerful and incredibly helpful to sorting out data prior to the visualization of the data and specifically when you know what youre looking for Remember BI is generally used when you dont know what youre looking for as a way to ask questions of the data quickly and with easy to read outputs An incredibly easy to follow video explaining Workflows has been linked My summary analysis of Alteryx is that it acts as a silo engine that can help answer data specific questions which BI can do as well but from an extremely granular standpoint as well as a standpoint of completely open architecture Again the above linked video is worth a watch But what does this do for Power BI Well Power BI is now a data output destination for Alteryx Workflows which becomes incredibly powerful to those who need to viewpresentcollaborate the Workflows derived data with parties who maybe dont do data for a living Power BI can now help take the valueprop of Alteryx to the next level and with that the businessdata specific Workflows to the next level That said Alteryx also is integrated into Power BI competitor solutions by Tableau NYSE DATA and Qlik NASDAQ QLIK What those competitors dont have however is a full productivity ecosystem complete with outside hardware and outside software They also dont have any other missioncritical assisting tech like what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>just bought and is likely to acquire more of or partner more with Alteryx is a nice example of this Alteryx is a great example of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the umbrella the ecosystem allowing a particular tool Power BI make a run on a partners customers without hurting the partner in any way but also hurting its competition in a direct way This is how the Satya Nadella vision is playing out That matters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also has the added bonus of being able to acquire via partnership even more ability to help a user run their business again thats shaping out to be a major strategic initiative for the company For me this wasnt just another partner integration to Power BI and admittedly a few have been For me this partner integration was a microcosm of the Satya Nadella <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>strategy I also really see it being meaningful to those who spend their day lost in a world of data That should work well for Power BI for the user and for Alteryx Hopefully it works well for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>shareholder too We only use
