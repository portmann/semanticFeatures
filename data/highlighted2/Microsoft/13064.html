Anchorite Intel recently reported that its firstquarter revenues would be down about a billion dollars Lower revenues from desktop forecasts will probably continue The new fiscal year had barely started when Intel NASDAQ INTC had to back away from projections it made just in January Slowing desktop sales are impacting the top line by roughly a billion dollars a quarter and if it continues through the year revenue may actually decline in relative to rather than rising in midsingle digits as predicted Midsingle digits would only be about billion But decreasing sales are just one of Intels problems There are also issues with competition contrarevenue aggressive timelines for D NAND that may not be met and of course the management of the company in general Some of those issues I wrote about in previous articles here and here ARM NASDAQ ARMH chips are everywhere Apple NASDAQ AAPL uses them in its iPhone and iPad Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM uses them in its Snapdragon line AMD uses them in its new Seattle server line and so on But in spite of the vast array of ARM chips in everything from the cheapest phones to the most expensive servers Intel has managed to maintain and even grow its lead in Windows NASDAQ MSFT desktop and servers I think that going forward this will become more difficult for Intel The Wintel duopoly may see future challenges from WinARM In January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>CEO Steve Ballmer at the Consumer Electronics Show said this Now I understand that Ballmer is no longer CEO but I am certain that he did not say that without the approval of Chairman of the Board Bill Gates And since Gates and Ballmer combined own billion of MSFT stock I do not think the current MSFT CEO Satya Nadella is going to change anything long term although it does appear he has paused for the moment But at last years developer Build Conference it sure sounded like full speed ahead Since MSFT only has about of the tablet market there is lots of room for growth and once tablets and probably ARM are more widespread with Windows can desktops be far behind If MS Office is on ARM doesnt it make sense to put Windows on ARM too This need for MSFT to move Windows to ARM is obvious when you look at how Apple iOS and Android are gaining market share All ARMS on Apple also makes sense Right now Apple uses ARM chips in all products except the iMacs It makes no sense to keep the Macs on Intel if there is an ARM chip that can do it as well The ARM chip will almost certainly be cheaper than Intel and software support for Apple will be much easier when that is accomplished Note Apple TV switched to ARM and lowered the products price at the same time The original Apple TV sold between and was essentially a scaled down Mac running a modified OS X on an Intel x processor and Nvidia CPU In late Apple released a second generation successor running a version of iOS on its own A processor incorporating the same GPU cores iOS devices use That shift involving a complete hardware architecture overhaul helped Apple to drop the price from to LinuxUnix runs twothirds of the web servers WTechs September and of course does not require Intel chips to run As more powerful ARM server chips are developed more competition for Intel Xeon products will be seen in the web server market Examples are AMDs Seattle Dense Server Product and Qualcomms new ARM server line The interesting bit is that Qualcomm is calling the end of the X era to coincide with the rise of the cloud era where client devices are largely powered by ARM devices and that service providers carriers and soon hyperscale datacenter operators will want to have the tools they use to design and test software on ARM client devices work on devices in the datacenter They could adapt their tools to X processors or they can hope that someone like Qualcomm creates server chips It is also noteworthy that Satya Nadella CEO at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was quoted next in the presentation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a version of Windows running on ARM processors for its smartphones and tablets and is widely expected to port Windows Server to ARM server chips if for nothing else than to be able to deploy it to run its own applications on a hardware platform it controls more tightly The IntelMicron NASDAQ MU joint venture to produce D NAND at nm is perhaps the best opportunity for rapidly increasing sales going forward into and However the technical difficulties are large and potentially troublesome at least as far as delivery goes The problem occurs because NAND is the most dense memory product ever produced and all those bits crowded into smaller and smaller space can cause extremely high error rates and subsequent failure rates Keep in mind that NANDs do wear out and the narrower the walls between the bit cells the faster the wear This is a case where Moores law run into the laws of physics In the graph below I have marked the nm line which is what Samsung OTCSSNLF uses for its D NAND and the nm line where Micron is attempting to go Note the huge increase in BER Bit Error Rate and decrease in endurance at nm compared to the nm line And remember Samsung offers a year warranty on its Pro Series Enterprise D something Intel will have to at least match at nm This is no slam dunk Intel has spent about B in CAPEX in the last years In on sales of B it spent about B on CAPEX and another B on RD If you compare that with Qualcomm with sales at about half of Intels B the company only spent B on CAPEX last year less than of sales However it did spend the same of revenue on RD B just like Intel Qualcomm thinks being fabless is a big advantage to the company and I agree But that is not the only edge that Qualcomm has As the companys top brass pointed out at its analyst day this week it will manufacture about billion chips in and it has relationships with different foundries Samsung TSMC GlobalFoundries SMIC UMC Amkor ASE Group SPIL STATS ChipPAC and UTAC using over different process technologies We think semiconductor companies have big CAPEX budgets but they are nothing compared to the oil industry According to Stern School of Management at NYU the oil industry CAPEX was an astounding billion last year Virtually every major oil company is cutting CAPEX and laying off thousands of employees Most of the cutbacks are for exploration and development but computers are everywhere including in the field and more importantly in the backoffice If the average cutback is thats billion and since computers are a part of CAPEX I dont think a few billion dollars in fewer desktopslaptops for the oil companies and their suppliers would be unexpected That is in addition to the general weakness in the market Despite managements efforts to tout the Intel brand in retail applications Intel will never be close to Apple or even Samsung in the retail market The company is basically a parts manufacturer albeit one of the most sophisticated and technically advanced In case anyone has forgotten Intel attempted to enter the retail market in the early s and one of its products was a microscope Things did not work out well then either The other issue I have stressed in previous articles is the need for management to concentrate and focus on what Intel does best utilizing the best fabs and best IP in the world to make large numbers of parts that its customers really want to buy I understand bracelets and drones make for great copy and if things were going well I would not mind the distraction if it was limited But things are not going well and it is time for management to concentrate on blocking and tackling You have Jim Brown in the backfield and an allPro line so run the ball up the middle and keep your opponents defense on the field wear them out and wear them down Thats how you are going to succeed Until there is new management or we actually see some success I think Intel is not a buy A company with much better defined prospects is Micron and it sells at X PE instead of Intels X Disclosure The author owns AMD stock Editors Note
