is currently the most successful smartphone producer in terms of mobile device profits In this article I provide a single chart that summarizes Apples advantages relative to its main competitors I conclude that Apples advantages are unlikely to be disrupted by any industry developments in the near term the next few years Smartphones remain the most important mobile device in the world with million units shipped in Q alone according to IDC Apple NASDAQ AAPL doesnt ship the most phones but is generally regarded as capturing the most profit in the industry which is probably the most important metric that can be applied in evaluating competitive success In this article I take up the problem of evaluating Apples competitive position going forward I show in a single chart that Apple continues to have numerous advantages over its competitors Back in my systems engineering days I spent a lot of time evaluating competing vendors for subcontracts on systems or components I would present my findings in a summary table that listed the key metrics and values for each competing vendor Usually I would color code the table entries according to a simple redyellowgreen grouping to reflect lowmediumhigh performance This was the rack and stack chart The rack and stack chart is very compact but a lot of thought goes into the selection of criteria and their evaluation for each of the competitors My thinking about competitiveness in smartphones is necessarily conditioned by my views of the structural changes within the industry and the rise of ARM architecture to dominance in smartphone processors or systems on chip SOCs These trends are reflected in the fact that all three of the top tier smartphone manufacturers Apple Samsung OTCSSNLF and Huawei all design their own custom SOCs based on ARM architecture If a company is on the wrong side of the paradigm shift away from commodity processors and to custom ARM SOCs I do count that against the company This is reflected in various metrics I describe below And there are other criteria as well including financial strength the ability to engineer and market the complete smartphone and the appeal of the mobile ecosystem SOC Engineering Does the company currently design its SOCs for its own smartphones Commodity suppliers of SOCs qualify as a yes but get a yellow rating for not building complete smartphones Uses ARM Architecture I continue to regard ARM as having no technical advantage compared to other architectures such as Intel NASDAQ INTC Architecture IA The only advantage I see is in cost but this is a powerful advantage that I dont see Intel being able to overcome Intels inability to achieve significant penetration in the smartphone market despite years of trying its inability to achieve profitability in its mobile business and its use of contra revenue to compensate all indicate to me that IA is fundamentally cost disadvantaged compared to ARM Has Modem Capability This is the ability to integrate a cellular modem onto the silicon of the SOC LTE modem integration gets a green rating while G or less gets a yellow Control of OS and SOC Design The ability to control the engineering of both the mobile operating system and the SOC confers synergies that are otherwise unavailable Knowledge of the design properties of the SOC allows OS designers to optimize the OS for the SOC and vice versa Company Profitability Net income for Q Less than billion gets a red rating billion a yellow billion or above a green Cash Less Debt Total cash and marketable securities minus short and longterm debt as of the end of calendar Q Below billion is red billion is yellow and above billion is green Retail Presence Partly this reflects whether the company makes or markets a smartphone rather than just selling components But even within the group of smartphone makers most of these are mostly dependent on online retailing and have relatively few physical stores These get a yellow rating OS Ecosystem This mostly pertains to whether the company has created its own mobile operating system Doing this affords numerous monetization advantages through online app and content stores and other services including streaming music and video Most importantly the architect of the mobile OS tends to be the driving force for the entire ecosystem even if the company doesnt build its own devices Some footnotes and general comments The financial results for Huawei are taken from its Financial Highlights page for the entire year Huawei is not publicly traded and doesnt file quarterly reports so this was the best I could do Generally if a company doesnt build the total smartphone thats viewed as a negative and this is reflected in the ratings for Intel NASDAQ INTC and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Building the total smartphone doesnt guarantee success witness <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT but its a prevailing characteristic of the successful smartphone companies Being vertically integrated usually means higher profitability On the modem rating for Samsung and Huawei I kind of gave them the benefit of the doubt given recent announcements of the Samsung Exynos series and the Huawei Kirin Both are announced but not yet shipping but expected to ship by early next year They could have been yellow but appear further along than Intel which isnt expected to ship an integrated LTE modem until SoFIA smartphone SOC production is brought in house for nm next year The predominantly green ratings for Apple certainly reflects my view of Apples competitive position Its a judgment call and Im sure there are plenty who would disagree with my assessments or the criteria Ive chosen But taking issue with the assessment has to be reconciled with Apples current smartphone profitability In other words if you believe that Apple is not the strongest competitor in the smartphone industry then why is it taking of the industry profit Id like to see anyone try to make that reconciliation However just because Apple is currently the top dog doesnt mean that it cant be disrupted by some development in the future Any assessment of Apples future competitiveness should include some assessment of the disruption potential Heres mine Various Apple competitors have already embraced the custom SOC paradigm Others are looking at ways to adapt this paradigm to their business models Googles rumored interest in finding a custom SOC partner probably reflects the realization that Google needs to move beyond its current commodity device model I see such partnerships as the key potential disruptors of Apples current smartphone preeminence The likely partners are Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Qualcomm and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel In fact I believe that the demands of the smartphone market are so compelling that partnerships such as these are almost inevitable So the real question is how effective will these partnerships be in competing with Apple These partnerships suffer from two key disadvantages First and foremost the collaboration between the companies is unlikely to be as efficient and productive as what Apple has achieved in a single company Secondly the collaborations have to occur in the context of an existing commodity framework that the partner companies have so far been unwilling to dispense with This means that the products of any partnerships will be competing with other commodity devices as well as with Apple This will tend to dilute the competitive impact of the partnerships on Apple This is already a fundamental problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>where its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>branded products Lumia Surface are not just competing with Apple but with the host of commodity devices that also run <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>provided operating systems And finally any partnership between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel in smartphones would almost certainly employ Intel Architecture processors This would provide better compatibility with existing Windows software but come at a higher cost for the SOC Windows phones with Intel Inside are probably the only hope for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in smartphones but these will appeal primarily to Windows diehards In short although the potential partnerships afford some improvement in competitiveness relative to Apple they dont achieve what Apple has been able to achieve within a single business entity This may ultimately lead to some further consolidation within the smartphone industry but a combination of say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel or Google and Qualcomm is probably more than three years in the future Primarily this is because the players involved arent really convinced that they cant make the commodity model work to their advantage The main chink in Apples armor is in modems I suspect that Apple is probably working on this Companies like Apple do these kinds of rack and stack assessments versus their competition all the time I doubt that the modem issue is something that Apple has overlooked Apple has been hiring communications engineers but its unclear whether they have the critical mass to build their own modem As Ive discussed elsewhere Apple will probably continue to rely on Qualcomm modems and may elect to license Qualcomm designs for future SOCs This would probably be the path of least resistance I believe that closing the modem gap is likely for Apple and that this will essentially cancel the improved competitiveness of future partnerships among Apples competitors Given that prospects are good for Apple to continue to take the lions share of smartphone industry profits I consider Apple a buy Editors Note This article
