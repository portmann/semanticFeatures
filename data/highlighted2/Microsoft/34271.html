class='textDiv'>How Facebook Twitter And LinkedIn Could Dominate Banking And Insurance Seeking Alpha Facebook could far more easily replicate a toptier retail banking and insurance business over the next years than vice versa and do so with far lower costs LinkedIn could similarly replicate businesses in commercial and investment banking and business brokerage levering its network to compete with the likes of Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley Twitter both syndicates for and competes with news wires but its technology could make payments and transaction processing faster cheaper and more secure than Visa or PayPal In previous cycles what was good for Silicon Valley also was good for Wall Street The above scenarios could see the Valley leave the Street behind next time Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter could help distribute financial risks and break up too big to fail balance sheets providing greater transparency and safety to the global banking and insurance system Shortly after the bust of the dotcom bubble I happened to move from Silicon Valley to Wall Street I was partially driven by the observation that Wall Street could do well without Silicon Valley doing well but it would be hard to imagine Silicon Valley doing well without at least some part of Wall Street doing at least as well if not better Only with the levels of trust ubiquity and irreplaceability reached by the social media networks by around can I now envision a cycle where internet firms may be able to not just sidestep but even prevent the next financial crisis and in doing so may become some of the largest banks and insurance companies by about At first glance banking and social media may seem so completely different as to defy any meaningful comparison or nonsuperficial integration So far many discussions on the relationship between financial services and social media have focused on these surface uses where a bank or financial adviser could use Facebook NASDAQ FB to advertise or engage with customers as they started doing with websites and online banking over the past years These discussions miss some of the main leaps social media has made in how we use the Internet now vs years ago and most of these changes are in better functional integration that make these sites resemble bank branches far more than they resemble newspaper pages It may be worth remembering that the word bank comes from the word for bench referring to the bench or table that business would be negotiated over face to face Similarly the word company comes from the Latin cum panis meaning with bread which could be considered another linguistic reminder of the intimate connection between social connection and business income Some other points of comparison include Chances are you probably have accounts at more than one financial institution and with more than one social network and you know each of these accounts by name in a way you would not relate to most other industries If you use social media actively chances are your account there is as valuable to you as a bank account of some size and would be just as devastating to you if you lost it Both financial services and social media have network effects and economies of scale which make them more valuable if your friends family and counterparties have accounts at the same place in ways not true of many other industries The above No has resulted in a trend toward concentration in about the top five brands in each space In social media these five giants are arguably Facebook LinkedIn NYSE LNKD Twitter NYSE TWTR Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Tencent OTCPK OTCPKTCEHY the Hong Kong listed ticker is one of the most traded in HK Financial services meanwhile have seen consolidation into global giants like Wells Fargo NYSE WFC JPMorgan Chase NYSE JPM HSBC Bank of America NYSE BAC and Citigroup NYSE C with the top four Chinese banks and Commonwealth Bank of Australia rounding out the global top by market cap In terms of size banks and social media firms also make up a large number of the top firms in the world by market cap after Apples NASDAQ AAPL bio Google matches Exxon Mobil NYSE XOM PetroChina NYSE PTR and Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB at around bio FB is about the size of JPM Toyota NYSE TM or Bank of China at bio and Tencent pairs with HSBC at around bio Both also rely very heavily on knowing many details about their account holders Multiple pages of information are required by a bank to lend you money and Facebook probably has hundreds if not thousands of pages of information on each user that has a valuable FB relationship In other words financial services and social media probably rely more directly on Big Data than most other industries At first glance banking and social media may seem so completely different as to defy any meaningful comparison or nonsuperficial integration For example People go to HSBC to deposit or borrow money while they go to Facebook to post or view photos and stories of friends Vice versa is still difficult for most people to even imagine The biggest banks employ hundreds of thousands while many comparably large social media companies by market cap only employ a few thousand Google is the outlier here Financials are primarily balance sheet businesses that usually trade between x book value with some outliers while social media stocks are assetlight FB trades at around x assets with little debt but over half of those assets are intangibles that easily trade at x sales Because of this balance sheet difference financial shareholders tend to focus on metrics like nonperforming loans NPL a measure of the quality of assets and book value measurement return on assets and funding costs an ROA of can be excellent for a bank that can reliably borrow at and lend at with in expenses Social media on the other hand relies very little on tangible assets and instead on users and revenueprofitability metrics per user It is far easier to move a retail banking account from one bank to another than it would be to move all the information from a Facebook profile to a Twitter LinkedIn or WeChat profile The last two differences begin to highlight how social media firms may have a tremendous advantage over traditional banks and insurance companies their existing assets are predominately brand network data and other intangibles which are harder to lose and much much much harder to acquire than tangible assets like loans and buildings Over the following three sections we present scenarios of how FB LNKD and TWTR might respectively take steps to dominate the industries of retail banking and insurance commercial and investment banking and processing payments and transactions to name a few ideas These cover only a few of the financial services I mentioned in an earlier article on the future of financial services If you were to ask me why dont you have a bank account with Facebook Bank my best answer would probably be because they havent yet told me theyd accept my deposits Facebook already applied for at least one banking license in Ireland and has money service licenses in many US jurisdictions but so far most of the press seems to be around the use of these licenses for things like remittances and money orders This would already be a huge step since many of these money transfer services can charge fees as high as around for simply moving money from one place to another but the worlds largest social network could do much more and do it much better With the appropriate licenses bankruptcy remote structure andor FDIC insurance Facebook could easily comfort millions of users into leaving deposits with them and transferring echecksFBchecks around to each other at a fraction of the cost and hassle of paper checks or wire transfers Whats more Facebooks data analytics also would be able to see patterns in cash management to better select and allocate customers currencies and term deposits than any current bank can do In the world of simple borrowing and lending perhaps the closest comparable to what a Facebook bank might offer would be the recently IPOd LendingClub Corporation NYSE LC LendingClub is probably the worlds most advanced peertopeer lender in providing a higher rate than bank deposits or bonds to customers with money willing to take some risk in lending it to borrowers at lower rates or better terms than they might be able to get from banks At a market cap of bio LC is still worth less than half of what FB paid for WhatsApp so its hard to say whether it would be better for Facebook to compete head on vs competing in a different segment or consider buying LC vs buying the regional banks that serve it Knowledge of customer life events and relationships also put it in a unique position to compete in the insurance space from so many angles In marketing and underwriting insurance Facebook already knows its avid skydiver customer base not just from their photos but from others they skydive with the clubs they belong to and the places they like to go giving them a far more complete picture into different risk factors than any traditional insurer might be able to see I just finished reading a book The Social Media Handbook for Financial Advisors by Matthew Halloran and Crystal Thies which suggests watching for things like job changes when marketing k rollovers which is just one example of something Facebook could automate and either service inhouse or allocate to a subscribing advisor for a fee As the book mentions incumbent financial firms have been very slow to adopt social media largely because they are held back by compliance policies that are far more conservative than the law and implemented manually by internal departments with little to gain and everything to lose Perhaps the biggest hurdle Facebook might face in trying to compete as a retail bank or insurer is its lack of physical branches but even this problem has been faced and solved long ago with at least one example being Telebank later acquired by ETrade NASDAQ ETFC and branded ETrade bank but similarly copied by firms like ING with their ING direct I had an account with Telebank and loved it I was able to get my paycheck direct deposited there had paper checks when I needed them could buy term deposits online and was rebated for any fees incurred using other banks ATMs which I gather was still far far cheaper for them than setting up their own ATMs andor branches Screenshot circa of Telebank an online bank with no physical branches Source NetBanker The big questions for Facebook should they choose to venture into this space are what services to keep on vs off their balance sheet and which jurisdictions to include As is often pointed out of todays tech companies Facebook may be the worlds largest media company but they produce none of their own content Uber may be one of the worlds largest car services but owns no cars and AirBnB may be one of the most popular hospitality providers but owns no real estate In simple terms this allows far higher return on asset ROA rates than firms that need to hold assets on their balance sheets but in financial services theres often a split between returns from holding and investing the assets vs earnings from check processing fees mortgage origination fees and other nonasset based sources Many financial services firms have had to pay hefty fees for distribution something Facebook could be a beneficiary of because it has more client relationships than almost anyone but a big part of retail banking margins also comes from the ability to borrow money at almost and lendinvest in almost anything else at higher rates Using just HSBCs reported financials as an example net revenues from retail banking were on average higher than from commercial banking over the past eight quarters but their net profit was higher in commercial banking than in retail banking This is largely because retail banking has far higher operating expenses lower operating margins than commercial banking even though commercial bankings loan loss provisions were double the ones for retail banking Just as Facebook is to consumer as LinkedIn is to professional LinkedIns superior network of where people have worked and how they are connected professionally puts it in a better position to enter the more complex world of commercial and investment banking There are already groups on LinkedIn where members post special situations opportunities to coinvest in buildings and businesses for sale but just as AirBnB improved on Craigslist by making searching for apartment stays smarter and prettier LinkedIn could have a whole set of templates of businesses for sale or in need of financing and algorithms to find just professionals likely to be suitable investors This idea is somewhat similar to one posted on LinkedIn titled Could Bloomberg Become a Giant Hedge Fund Of the Big nonChinese social networks Twitter is somewhat an outlier in its exceptional simplicity and character per tweet limit On one hand this might seem to limit the brands value if I want to reach women between the ages of and interested in investing I would post a Facebook ad if I want to reach treasury managers in Hong Kong and Singapore I would sponsor a post on LinkedIn but Twitter to me at least does not provide the same demographic slicing advantage That said Twitters simplicity also can be an advantage in solving one of the simplest yet still most elusive problems in the financial world how to move money and signed documents from one place to another quickly securely and inexpensively I have written and presented extensively on Bitcoin and how I believe technologies like Bitcoin will do to banks and wire transfers what email did to post offices and telegraphs but also recognize many people are put off by Bitcoin as has been used so far Like email everyone reading this knows uses and most likely loves the underlying technology but has probably trusted a big company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Google or Yahoo to manage and provide your mail service rather than using open source software to try and run and host your own email servers Similarly users may prefer to start using a Twitter Wallet and be able to send money to each other internationally and instantaneously through their short Twitter handles Twitter could hold this money the same way Facebook Bank would avoiding the need but perhaps keeping the option to link up a bank account or credit card which has made PayPal so cumbersome to use and may still be Apple Pays AAPL weakest link The beauty of Twitter is that it is so fast so simple and its security can be tuned up or down as needed I like how many sites have already outsourced their login feature to sites like Twitter LinkedIn and Facebook so that I can sign in with my Twitter account and with a second layer of security this feature would be as secure as my online banking accounts if not more Another simple not necessarily financial service I am surprised Twitter has not started offering yet is the simple service of handling digital signatures on documents In addition to the security of their signin and their HTTPS certificate Twitter also has verified accounts which like AirBnB provide extra proof that the person behind the tweet is who they say they are This gives me a high degree of confidence that a tweet I see from JimCramer really came from Jim Cramer But why stop at Tweets If someone uploaded a legal document and signed it with their Twitter handle it should be easy enough for Twitter to print an unbreakable code on the PDF that can be scanned and verified on the Twitter website confirming the document as matched on the screen was in fact signed by Jim Cramer After that Twitter could further use the power of its technology to break down terms and line items in contracts being able to automatically notify for example of the Libor fixing level on an interest rate swap contract JimCramer is an example of a verified account as proven by the little blue checkmark Source Twitter The ValleyvsStreet observation seemed to prove true during the dotcom boom as somethings at Goldman were well paid for underwriting the IPOs of somethings in Silicon Valley whether or not the latter went bust a year later The other half of the observation proved just as true from as financials profited very well by moving on to other sectors especially home mortgages while the technology and telecom sectors seemed a decade or more away from recovering It took the subprime mortgage crisis and the resulting global financial crisis to bring financials down to the levels technology was still struggling to recover from and only since have they started to recover together The following chart shows this year history of the performance of financials vs technology in the US through the Sector SPDR Financials NYSEARCA XLF and Technology NYSEARCA XLK ETFs and compares it with the SPDR Bank ETF NYSEARCA KBE Compared with XLF KBE is relatively underweight large banks and overweight in smaller regional banks with firms like Bank of the Ozarks and First Republic Bank having about the same weight as JPM These smaller banks as shown by the chart above have underperformed larger banks since the financial crisis as the trend toward concentration in the top banks has continued and rising compliance costs has disproportionately handicapped smaller banks Facebook Bank might be safer than a traditional bank One of the domino risks of the global financial crisis was a web of connections and regulations that hold the financial system together and favor larger banks Regulated banks take deposits and then follow rules about how they can invest all but a fraction of those deposits that they must keep on reserve But like many rules this can lead employees to focus more on ticking boxes than actually solving for the best riskadjusted return in each different case When concentrated in a few large balance sheets rather than spread over many different diversified balance sheets this results in a too big to fail problem where governments find the need to bail out a big bank rather than letting a big domino fall and crush other parts of the economy Facebook bank could operate in one of two ways each of which could result in a safer system than the one ruled by Basel III Facebook could broadly distribute risks to a large number of different investorslenderstraders and it would probably be better than even LendingClub in targeting which of these participants would be in the best position to bear each specific risk or Facebook could set up a set of its own bankruptcyremote balance sheets and capitalize them with an intelligent series of tier and cocostyle bonds that would spread out too big to fail risk while providing an array of fixed income instruments many banks and bond traders banks today would envy All of the above scenarios are hypothetical and ask the question of how FB LNKD or TWTR just to name three examples could enter compete in and dominate the financial sector if they wanted to It is entirely up the executives and boards of these companies and the governments that regulate them to decide which if any of these deals and ventures happen and in what combination US million is easily enough capital to start a bank insurance company asset manager or brokerage firm in a place like Hong Kong or Singapore two places with lots of money and lots of users who would welcome the higher level of customer service efficiency and lower fees one of these companies would likely bring Another possible way these firms might enter this space is by buying rather than building financial firms Here one might be tempted to look at a portfolio like KBEs to spot potential acquisition targets but here it is important to keep in mind an important lesson from the social networking companies themselves they got funded by venture capitalists because they could show a steady and growing base of users and they bought WhatsApp for its steady and growing base of users Any financial firm one of these Internet giants buys would likely be for its customers or its infrastructure and I have yet to find one that would be cheaper for one of these firms to buy than to build Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks Source How Facebook Twitter And
