class='textDiv'>Alphabet Is Its Near Record Enterprise Value A Problem Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOG Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital Stone Fox Capital clicks Alphabet is quickly catching up with Apple for the largest market cap and more importantly enterprise value in the stock market The key trend that hurt Apple at its peak value in isnt forecast to impact Alphabet anytime soon The biggest issues for Alphabet reaching record enterprise value and market cap are spending habits and a stretched multiple not sheer size alone The market has long debated the market size issue with regards to Apples NASDAQ AAPL large market cap The stock hit a huge market cap of billion in and has had a difficult time appreciating from that level ever since One part of the story is the ongoing questions about market and growth potential at that point in time The other part of the story is the inability to generate stock gains at the largest valuation in the stock market Apple requires a massive billion investment to acquire a small position So while Apple has repeatedly maxed out in the billion range AlphabetGoogle NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is quickly approaching that size under the radar The Internet search giant is quickly seeing its enterprise value surge towards the value of Apple The key being that the latter has had a sizable cash position for a long time now The interesting part of the recent surge in Alphabet is that not a lot of discussion exists around the market cap reaching billion The market cap is actually close to where Apple started facing the size debates back in early The hidden difference is that Apple built a sizable war chest with over billion of cash on the balance sheet and started returning the cash to shareholders Alphabet has a nice cash position now but the difference creates a situation where the enterprise value is quickly merging At the end of the September quarter Apple had billion of net cash and Alphabet had billion of net cash The initial surprise is that the cash balances are getting closer due to Apple returning billion of capital in the last quarter alone For now though removing the cash from the market cap provides the value for the business The enterprise value for Apple is billion and Alphabet is billion Suddenly the enterprise valuation difference between the two technology titans is only billion A roughly change in value by one of the stocks in favor of Alphabet would place the enterprise values near even Alphabet gaining and Apple losing is very reasonable and would do the trick RBC Capitals Mark Mahaney even forecast the possibility of Alphabet reaching The ironic part of his research was the lack of mention regarding the enterprise value surging past Apple to over billion In that scenario with Apple trading flat to down Alphabet would even take over the largest market cap Im sure most market participants will debate whether market size matters Ultimately the bigger a market valuation the more investment it requires to produce a gain Looking back at the debate on Apple in I found this piece from Bill Maurer regarding Apple Bill made an interesting point about the weight of Apple in the iShares US Technology ETF NYSEARCA IYW The Apple weight in the ETF is now meaning that if anything the ideal scenario is a reduced weight for Apple causing automatic selling of the stock The interesting point is that the combined Alphabet investment sits at The combined GOOG and GOOGL shares slightly surpass the value of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT I dont think any laws of numbers require that Alphabet hits a wall soon due to market cap similar to what happened to Apple After all my previous research highlighted that the change in the earnings trend was the culprit for Apple hitting a wall in Nothing in reality prevents either stock from reaching a valuation of trillion In the case of Alphabet the theory that the new CFO would bring adult supervision to the story helped usher the stock to the current level Within months the stock surged from to over now The reality though is the change of the corporate name to Alphabet and the recent reacceleration of hiring questions whether grownups are actually in charge now As this chart highlights Alphabet isnt facing the negative EPS trend that hit Apple Analysts expect rather solid growth for the next fiscal year Using nonGAAP numbers analysts forecast Alphabet generating a EPS of for growth If anything the Internet search business avoids a lot of the pitfalls that hitting a large market size hurt Apple due to selling electronic components Search doesnt have the cycles like smartphones and computers Ultimately though the market cap size is indicative of huge profits that only get more difficult to grow If Alphabet was to grow the stock to grab the enterprise value similar to Apple the stock would reach At that price the stock would trade with a PE multiple of x the current EPS expectations With roughly in cash per share the stock would trade at a multiple of x the enterprise value Not exactly expensive for the growth rate but the multiple is more than double the rate achieved by Apple At this rate Alphabet undoubtedly overtakes Apple with the largest enterprise value in the next year With estimates that the digital ad world still has plenty of growth backed by the forecasts of RBC Alphabet isnt likely to run into the dip in earnings that hit Apple on its historic run Ultimately Alphabet is going to start hitting a ceiling inherent with the laws of large numbers
