giant Intel NASDAQ INTC it seems that every piece of good news is countered by something negative For all that has happened to Intel in the past couple of years the stock is basically flat since its Q earnings report The latest news on the company seems to confirm that Intel is likely to stay range bound until some new catalyst comes to light The latest set of phone rumors came out Friday when Bloomberg reported that Apple NASDAQ AAPL will be using Intel G baseband modems meant for ATTs NYSE T network along with some overseas markets Those iPhones headed for Verizons NYSE VZ network along with ones going to China will stay current supplier Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Weve been hearing all along that Intel would receive approximately of the iPhones business this year so I dont think the latest news does much to change that either way ATT is one of the two main US carriers so that represents a chunk of iPhone sales and other international markets will chip in a little If things go well this year can Intel steal more share from Qualcomm in The main question here is how will this impact Intel financially To make a major move into tablets Intel relied on contrarevenues that really hurt the companys mobile margins If Intel is giving Apple a great deal to try and gain market share the same will happen again We hopefully will get more on this situation at the Q report when Intel gives guidance for the second half of the year and hopefully some analysts will try to get additional color from management We also got some bad news out of IDC which took down its PC shipment forecast for the year by about basis points The group is now expecting a decline in partly due to a worse than expected Q It was weakness in the PC space that caused Intel to reduce its yearly revenue guidance at the Q earnings report At that point analysts were looking for growth this year helped by the Altera purchase and extra week in the fiscal year Estimates have continued to come down since then with the street currently expecting just revenue growth in The decision from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to give out free Windows upgrades has held back some from upgrading their computer hardware If Intel cannot overcome this PC weakness it might need to take down its yearly guidance again this time to revenue growth in the low single digits Unfortunately for the chip giant this has been the dominant pattern in recent years start with high guidance and reduce it throughout the year For the stock to get moving again something has to change in a big way PC sales declines leveling off would certainly be a help and perhaps the company can get some of its other business units like IoT to start show progress weve been waiting for The large restructuring should eventually help the bottom line Last month I asked if the company should consider taking out more debt in order to buyback shares This scenario would look even better now given the continued fall in US interest rates combined with the fact that many expect the Fed to hike perhaps in July A decent buyback could also realize a cash flow savings since after tax debt costs would be lower than the dividend payments Intel would save by reducing the share count While the Altera deal was rather significant in terms of purchase price Intel management is willing to do more deals Currently however there is no shopping list which I think is a mistake if Krzanich is being truthful A company that needs growth should always have a list of potential acquisitions in mind Intel needs to find new areas for growth and the article above suggests cybersecurity as one potential area to consider While a few billion dollars in the cyber space will likely only get you a few hundred million or so in annual revenues at least Intel would bring on a business thats growing at a very fast clip The ongoing narrative continued for Intel last week While we got more insight into the modem progress for the upcoming iPhone launch IDC also took down its PC forecast for It seems like every piece of good news for the chip giant is countered by something bad Intel desperately needs a catalyst to break out of its current trading range and a decent buyback or acquisition might be able to do the trick Until then Intel remains a solid income investment thanks to its dividend but the stock is unlikely
