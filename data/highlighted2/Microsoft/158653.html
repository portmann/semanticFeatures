RealSense technology can accelerate development of autonomous commercial drones The recent million investment in dronemaker Yuneec Electric Aviation gives Intel NASDAQ INTC the opportunity to ignite the smart drone revolution Yuneec is not as famous as DJI when it comes to commercial aerial photographyvideography drones However Intels entry could help Yuneec launch its first ever autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle product As of now Yuneecs topoftheline Typhoon Q K drones best smart feature is the Watch MeFollow Me function Adding the compute power of an Intel x Atom x processor could really smarten up Yuneec products and make them function more like intelligent flying robots Like other commercial drones available in the market the Yuneec Q K uses ARMbased simple processors made by Ambarella NASDAQ AMBA The dualcore Ambarella A Ultra HD K camera processor ARM CortexA is probably inside the Typhoon Q K Current drones still require a human to use a wireless controller to operate them However the advanced artificial intelligence programming capabilities of an x Intel processor offer manufacturers a way to come up with smarter drones which will not rely on extensive human intervention or GPS coordinates The partnership with Intel could lead to Yuneec using a dualcomputer system that uses an ARMbased processor for cameravideo management and an x Intel processor for Smart Mode autonomous flight D Robotics which recently received million funding mostly from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM uses a dualcomputer system for its Solo drone product Qualcomm and D Robotics are now in partnership to bring advanced computing to drones Intels deal with Yuneec is a timely answer to Qualcomms strong interest in supplying dronecentric processors Recode reported that Qualcomm is offering its latest Snapdragon mobile processor to drone manufacturers Ambarella is the current goto choice for drone processors However Qualcomm insists that a single Snapdragon processor can replace the functions of the different processors used in drones today Qualcomm also bought KMel Robotics last February KMel Robotics was a startup famous for developing swarm aerial robotics technology Such aggressiveness of Qualcomm needs to be addressed with equal aplomb by Intel and Yuneec MITs Robust Robotics Group used an Intel Atom mobile processor inside an autonomous indoor navigating drone in Intel also demonstrated earlier this year that its inhouse RealSense technology gives drones computer vision so they could automatically avoid obstacles when in flight The distance measurementD depthsensing feature of RealSense camera is similar in concept to what KMel Robotics did to program their swarm of quadrotor drones Intels small mistake is that it failed to snap up KMel Robotics Intel helped KMel create its sensational YouTube video Flying Robot Rockstars last year RealSenseenabled drones could also be programmed to work in cooperative or swarm mode Getting hold of the swarm artificial intelligence algorithms improves the winning chances of the million bet on Yuneec Intel could perhaps hire Vijay Kumar Kumar was the robotics professor who helped the graduate students who created KMel Robotics The swarm concept for autonomous drones has great potential in industrial and military applications The US Navy is testing its Project LOCUST LowCost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarming Technology LOCUST is the navys concept weapon for autonomous warfare using killer smart drones that hunt in packs As of now Intel is only proposing RealSenseenabled drones for surveillance or for the repair of navy ships With Vijay Kumars help Intel and Yuneec could also probably create a swarm of very smart killer drones Ascending Technologies the first drone maker to use RealSense technology says drones can be equipped with up to Intel Core i processors Complex swarm artificial Intelligence programming requires high compute power We all know that an Intel Core i has higher compute processing power than a Qualcomm Snapdragon The upcoming SkylakeU products from Intel has a Core i processor with a TDP of only W Energy efficient x processors coupled with RealSense hardwaresoftware could deliver the perfect smart drone for autonomous warfare and package delivery RealSense technology is already used in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Hello nopassword method of unlocking Windows computers The facial recognition and gestures interaction of a RealSense D camera is therefore also applicable to military surveillanceattack drones Automated target selection needs accurate facial recognition to identify hostile targets Intel and Yuneec can still go toetotoe with DJI in chasing the commercialrecreational market but the big money is really in creating smart drones for the military market The military market for drones is far more lucrative for Intel and Yuneec Business Insider Intelligence says only of the billion that will be spent on drones in the next decade will be for commercial purposes The partnership with Yuneec Electric Aviation is one more reason why we should all stay long on INTC
