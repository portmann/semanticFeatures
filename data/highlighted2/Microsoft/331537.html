Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Windows Mobile features Continuum which allows the phone to be docked for desktop use The new HP Elite x puts more processing power behind Windows Mobile When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT pulled the plug on the Surface last year it didnt quite abandon its Windows on ARM initiative <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continued to work on a phone version of Windows that would run on ARM chips Microsofts Lumia and XL feature the new Windows OS but are rather unimpressive underpowered phones That all changes with the arrival of the HP NYSE HPQ Elite x powered by the new Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon I have at various times pointed to Microsofts lack of presence in smartphones as an ongoing problem The smartphone has become the most important personal computing device in many peoples lives and in emerging markets may be the only one As much as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bulls might like to forgive the rightoff for the Lumia purchase Microsofts smartphone business has been a monumental failure There have always been a number of obstacles to adoption of Microsofts Windows Phone operating systems Personally Ive always liked the OS and thought it superior to Android but Ive concluded that the tile based interface is offputting to most consumers Its just so busy and complicated achieving remarkable data overload in such a compressed space Its a computer geeks vision of a mobile operating system And you know how us computer geeks love complexity For some reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has never been willing to tone this down and has instead kept going in the opposite direction squeezing in even more tiles of varying sizes Until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>realizes that most people are not as entranced by complexity as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is the OS will always have a limited following This even more than the relative paucity of apps is whats holding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>back in smartphones Many observers have already declared Windows Mobile dead just based on apps Im not willing to do that I see definite progress The Windows app store continues to gain apps and is now up to The ability to create Universal Windows apps that run on all Win platforms has made it easier for developers to create apps for Windows Mobile The killer app for Win Mobile is clearly Continuum which allows the phone to be used in a desktoplike Win environment using a keyboard monitor and mouse Its still not quite full Windows of course Its Windows in the RT vein You cant run legacy Windows software You cant run much in the way of PC games But you can run the Windows Mobile version of Office The ability to create Word Powerpoint and Excel documents in a desktop like environment hosted in a smartphone is no small achievement Those of you who remember the Motorola Atrix G might be inclined to think that this is the same very hobbled desktop experience Its kind of the same vision from a hardware standpoint but Continuum offers so much more than the Atrix ever could Until now what has held Continuum back has been underpowered processors available on Windows Mobile devices Microsofts own Lumia and XL are powered by the Snapdragon and respectively Now that Qualcomm has fielded the powerful Snapdragon built on the latest Samsung nm FinFET process the tech world is acknowledging how lousy Qualcomms previous generation processors really were The HP Elite x fixes that with the new Snap processor and now Continuum can be expected to work more smoothly and efficiently Continuum isnt an ideal solution for those used to the power of a full Wintel desktop but it greatly increases the TAM for Windows phone The Elite x comes has an available dock that provides output for a monitor ethernet port and USB ports It makes for a very tidy and convenient way to instantly convert the phone to a desktop system Theres also a notebook adapter that provides a screen keyboard and battery while using the phones processor This points the way to a very likely future for consumerlevel personal computing Many consumers home personal computing needs are addressed by Windows Mobile Continuum capabilities as exemplified by the new Elite x It is also one of the least expensive Windows personal computers one could buy if you exclude peripherals The significance of the Elite x is that no other smartphone or personal computing platform can match its capabilities Not Android not iOS Sure you can plug an Android device into a monitor and pair it with a keyboard and mouse But youre still left with the Android home screen and the limitations inherent in Android apps Not really a desktop experience The situation is even worse in iOS For years iPhone users have been able to display their screen output on a TV or monitor through an adapter cable or wirelessly via Airplay This didnt really allow a desktop experience however because iOS forces the user to make all input through the phone touchscreen or a Bluetooth keyboard The user is constantly forced to glance back and forth between the monitor and the iOS device Pretty useless except for watching videos Its a shame really because iOS devices are quite powerful and come with a suite of office productivity apps from Apple NASDAQ AAPL Here we see the wisdom of Microsofts convergence approach and the stupidity of Apples dogmatic refusal to embrace convergence For year people have talked about this concept of a single mobile device that could serve all possible roles of smartphone tablet and desktop There have even been a few attempts such as the Atrix G With the HP Elite x and Windows Continuum consumers now have a very credible realization of this vision Its not perfect but its only going to get better as processors and operating systems improve As I thought about the significance of the x I came to believe that this is really the future of the Windows PC even more than Intel powered tablets and convertibles Its fortunate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and its OEM partners that this future is ARM based It means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now has a good opportunity to expand market share in smartphones Undoubtedly Microsofts Lumia brand will be getting Snapdragon upgrades soon While the PC market does appear to have stabilized this is just a nice word for stagnated The true growth is in smartphones and smartphonelike devices The power of high end smartphones is already well in excess of what most consumers do with them The value proposition of Windows Mobile is therefore very compelling consumers get to take full advantage of the power of their device to do more experience more The new generation of Windows Mobile devices as exemplified by the Elite x can be expected to grow market share in smartphones Whether this is enough to restore <span style='background-color:
