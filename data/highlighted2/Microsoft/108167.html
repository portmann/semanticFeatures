growth is slowing even declining sequentially Samsung is the worlds largest smartphone maker by volume but its share of the market has declined after its poor first quarter This time last year Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi was seen as a growing headache for Apple NASDAQ AAPL with its iPhone lookalike phones running an Android operating system Fast forward one year and Xiaomi sales are slowing significantly Samsung OTCSSNLF has lost momentum as well and Apple looks like a genius for making larger screens with the iPhone Therefore with many analysts expecting iPhone sales growth of more than this year for Apple its beginning to look like neither Xiaomi nor any one else can slow Apples impressive momentum Prior to Apples launch of the iPhone Xiaomi really was causing a headache for the worlds largest company As seen above the appearance between Apples iPhone and Xiaomis Mi couldnt be more similar Xiaomi was then able to sell its devices at a much lower price point due to cheaper components and an Android operating system In the second quarter of last year Xiaomi shipped million units for a whopping increase yearoveryear That gave it a share of the smartphone market according to Canalys thereby making Xiaomi the top smartphone vendor in China However its fortunes havent been nearly as great competing against the iPhone During Apples December quarter it shipped million iPhone units for a increase yearoveryear Then during its last quarter Apple once more posted yearoveryear shipment growth of to ship over million iPhones Meanwhile Xiaomis smartphone shipment growth has slowed to just during the first half of million total shipments According to research from Quartz Xiaomis smartphone shipments during the second quarter even showed a minor decline vs the first quarter something that hasnt been seen during its remarkable run As a result Apple emerged as the top smartphone vendor in China with a share of the market after the first quarter and Xiaomis share slipped from to This suggests that Xiaomi isnt nearly the Apple threat that so many analysts and investors thought it would be Apples impressive growth in China should make shareholders very excited given the fact that G LTE networks in China do not yet cover the entire country and in many instances are just being built Thats why Apples outlook in China remains so bright and why it can build on the unit sales growth that UBS expects during this current quarter Beyond China Apple is forecasted to sell million total iPhones this quarter a number that many believe is too conservative and a number that will surpass million for the first six months of Once more thats good for a jump which is not only causing turmoil for Xiaomi but also Samsung During Samsungs last quarter it witnessed a decline in smartphone sales and a decline in profits This tells investors that not only is Samsung having a hard time competing against Apple but that these struggles are occurring despite Samsung selling units at a lower profit with cheaper phones Now that Apple has seemingly figured out what the consumer wants larger screens and is on tap for an iPhone refresh later this year its really hard to find a viable competitor that can slow it down Samsung has always been that competitor but it seems to have hit a wall Meanwhile Xiaomi looked like a real threat but its shipments are slowing and even declining sequentially That leaves BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Lenovo and Nexus among others each of which whose history as a competitor against Apple has been anything less than stellar As a result it doesnt appear that any company can stop Apple or at least not in the foreseeable future With the majority of Apples profit coming from iPhone sales this is good for investors and suggests that Apple will soon surpass resistance at to trade much higher After all Apple still has a very large opportunity to convert smartphone users IDC estimates that Apple controls just of the worldwide smartphone market While large it leaves open the possibility for additional market share gains in the coming years something that Apple proved is possible after having its share rise from last year At just x next years earnings Apple is a must buy a company that can only be stopped by itself Editors Note This article
