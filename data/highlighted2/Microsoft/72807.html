Seeking Alpha Xiaomi is enabling its customers to try installing a custom Windows upgrade on their Mi Android phones Letting people install Windows on their Android smartphones can increase the total addressable market of Microsofts monetization of Skype Bing and Office WMPower User reported two days ago that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT will release the custom Windows ROM for all Xiaomi Mi Android phone users today June This is almost two months before the official release of the desktop version of Windows on July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is massively crowdsourcing its effort of infecting existing Android phones with its Windows software <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>first announced the Windows onXiaomi Android experimental project last March Only a select few of testers were able to experiment with the custom Windows Xiaomi back then Today anybody with a Xiaomi Mi phone will be able to download the said Windows ROM Chinese owners of the Mi will only need to sign up on this link to download the Windows ROM This is a very important development because it will determine if ARMbased Android phones could really jibe with the universal apps concept of Windows for Phones Like most Android phones today the Xiaomi Mi uses an ARMbased processor A YouTube video of a Chinesespeaking guy demonstrates that Windows runs decently on his Mi handset Xiaomi one of the worlds top smartphone vendors sold million smartphones last year If we guesstimate that of that figure are Mi handsets the potential number of AndroidtoWindows defectors among Xiaomi phone users could hit million Android is disproportionately dominant in smartphones so Xiaomis helping hand is a welcome boost for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Even after buying Nokias NYSE NOK smartphone hardware business last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still struggling to increase the global share of Windows phones The successful implementation of a Windows softwarebased conversion method of Xiaomis flagship Android phone could lead to more OEMs requesting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to also provide them with custom ROMs Providing custom Windows ROMs to existing flagship or midrange Android phones from Samsung OTCSSNLF LG Electronics OTCLGEAF Huawei and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY is a shortcut toward persuading more than one billion people to try Windows for Phones Providing a software solution to make existing Android phones in to Windows handsets is also a cheaper alternative to subsidizing Lumia Windows phones Xiaomi is not one of the Android device manufacturers that signed up to preinstall Microsofts mobile apps on Android phonestablets However Xiaomis tacit approval for its customers to try the custom Windows ROM is an even better proposition The monetization of Bing Skype and Office is likely stronger when the host mobile device runs in Windows not in Android OS Tracking through system background processes the location and mobile activities of users are necessary toward delivering hypertargeted hyperlocal mobile ads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still has a long way to catch up before it can match Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL pervasive presence in global mobile advertising However Nadellas turn as CEO has transformed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in to a freemium company that is akin to what Google is right now The free mobile appsoperating system from Google is just a mouse trap to capture billions of eyeballs for mobile ads The collaboration of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Xiaomi might also be due to both of them having a close relationship with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Qualcomm is an early investor in Xiaomi <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>picked Qualcomms ARMbased processors in for its first Windows Phone handsets All existing Windows Phone smartphones available today use a Snapdragon SoC Intel NASDAQ INTC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are allegedly plotting to bring their successful Wintel PC alliance to the mobile sector The cheap Cherry Trail Intel Atom X family of processors is Windows ready However it doesnt really matter much for MSFT investors as to which processor Xiaomi will use on its future smartphones The important thing is that Xiaomi is helping distribute Windows to more people Xiaomis brand popularity might even be stronger than Microsofts Lumia Xiaomi was able to sell million phones through its online store within hours a Guinness record that <span style='background-color:
