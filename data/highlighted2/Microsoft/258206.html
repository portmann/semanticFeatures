#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Universal Windows Platform app is a Windows experience that is built upon the Universal Windows Platform UWP At the core of UWP apps is the idea that users want their experiences to be mobile across ALL their devices and they want to use whatever device is most convenient or productive for the task at hand Windows makes it easy to develop apps for one store to reach all Windows devices PC tablet phone and more Its easier to support a number of screen sizes and also a variety of interaction models whether it be touch mouse keyboard a game controller or a pen Currently we have vehicle infotainment which is functionally rich but shares virtually no common interface elements across vehicle manufacturers and sometimes across models within that same manufacturer Imagine if Dell computers had an operating system just as complete and feature rich as HP computers yet the interfaces were entirely different Youll notice hardware wise these two systems are really quite different But thats just the start of it Once you start interacting with these two infotainment systems you quickly find they share nothing in common even though all the functions you are trying to carry out are common to most all vehicles entering an address in the navigation system pairing a smartphone etc I have been a software architect for decades and inconsistent user interfaces just bother me Its like the FileSave issues we computer users had to deal with in the early eighties when no two apps could agree on how you save the file youre working on Finally though a few companies got together and defined the Common User Interface Guidelines These guidelines defined the interface elements that most applications shared ie where FileSave is where the Help menu is etc The beauty of these guidelines is that anyone could sit down at anyone elses computer and even though a particular app might be unfamiliar you could always get around with relative ease Why cant vehicle infotainment be so standardized Why cant there be a standardization of how addresses are entered or phones paired The vehicle infotainment market is currently dominated by BlackBerrys NASDAQ BBRY QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment which underlies the veneer that the vehicle manufacturer places on top Even though QNX provides rich functionality it does little in the way of defining a common user interface Car manufacturers seem to just build whatever user interface model they deem appropriate at the time It is now time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to take infotainment under the Windows umbrella by replacing the incumbent operating systems in their entirety and introducing the driver to the benefits of Microsofts Universal Apps Strategy Well just ignore Microsofts first stab at automotive with Windows Embedded Automotive Auto manufactures could still customize the infotainment experience with apps much like Verizon NYSE VZ or ATT NYSE T do today on a smartphone Likely Windows for infotainment would be near free for the auto manufacturers like it is today for the array of other Windows supported devices The big money to be made will be in a whole new genre of infotainment focused apps on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>apps store Of course all apps would have specialized permissions security and safety features that would prevent certain apps from running unless the vehicle is in Park Like video playback or handsondisplay intensive apps Infotainment would drive voiceoperated apps to a whole new level Cortana for instance would be tasked with reading your emails or selecting music for you to play Cortana would also be your navigation sweetheart giving directions and understanding commands to avoid freeways or canceling the route There would be many new industry specific apps too Uber Pending UBER for instance could have indash apps for drivers Locale specific entertainment apps would likely be popular as well But infotainment apps would not be limited to while youre driving apps I would love to read the news or emails in a format larger than my smartphone if Im say parked at the dentist office while my kid gets his teeth cleaned The infotainment display is also a reasonable display to watch a movie on or YouTube video Should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>own this space No of course not I fully expect Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL to also pitch their infotainment systems reinvented to the car manufacturers I expect Apple will build a beautiful infotainment OS one that extends their walled garden right out the street But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is in the best position to set the bar for this space largely due to the portability and design philosophy of Windows and Universal Apps ie apps built for the PC will run on smartphones tablets infotainment systems XBox and laptops Car manufactures will still have some reasonable leeway in designing beautiful user interface hardware but they will need to offer the infotainment OS on some sort of portable media like an SD Card so that the customer can pick the preferred OS just like they would pick interior color or whether its a hybrid There is a lot to like about the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but I especially like Windows Universal Apps and Continuum and feel they will have an increasingly important role over the next several years I believe the Windows powered infotainment systems will be a reality as will similar offerings by both Apple and Google This new market should act as a positive price catalyst for all three but especially for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as its already got the harmonic
