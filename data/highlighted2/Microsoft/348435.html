IDCs projection of a PC sales decline for presents an incomplete picture A more comprehensive take on the state of the Windows PC should include tablets and ins A recent report by market research firm IDC painted a bleak picture of global PC sales declines with a yy decline for and projecting another decline in This picture is incomplete however since it includes only traditional PC form factors of desktops and notebooks If tablets and in convertibles based on Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Windows are included then the decline is not so bad Most importantly Windows tablet unit sales appear to have grown by about yy in Ive written in the past about Microsofts strategy of mobilizing the PC moving Windows into tablet and tabletkeyboard convertible devices and now even smartphones through the Continuum feature Despite my putative role of Apple NASDAQ AAPL fanboy I continue to use Windows PCs in my daily work and have expressed admiration for Microsofts excellent Surface Pro SP and Surface Book Realizing that the Windows PC is evolving I didnt see how one could ignore this evolution in assessing PC sales stabilization I understand IDCs take on the matter Tablets and convertibles are a separately reported category and they dont want to mix apples and oranges But any assessment of the business impact on companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel NASDAQ INTC must take into account tabletconvertible sales of Windows devices This is especially true of devices such as the Surface Pro which sports a full version of Win as well as a choice of powerful Intel Skylake processors SP and similar devices from Microsofts OEMs really have become the new PC and it doesnt make sense to exclude them when looking at how the Windows ecosystem is doing Accounting for sales of Windows tablet and in devices is a little more difficult Clearly we want not just Microsofts sales but the sales of the entire industry I also believe that sales of lighter weight tablets such as the Surface based on Intel Atom processors also should be included Over the course of its four quarterly reports for Intel reported that it had sold a total of million tablet processors presumably Atom series such as the Atom xZ in the Surface Intels tablet processor sales were not all for Windows tablets however Strategy Analytics has reported that Windows had a share of the tablet market in as shown in the graphic below IDCs total for global tablet sales in is million which IDC explicitly states included lightweight tablets such as the iPad as well as in convertibles such as SP Applying the Strategy Analytics percentage yields a total number of Windows tablets of million Given the number of tablet processors Intel reported sold in this number seems fairly conservative IDC and Gartner both report PC sales using the same criteria and excluding tablets on a quarterly basis IDCs estimate of global PC shipments for was million Gartners estimate of global PC shipments for was million The difference between the two companies probably provides a reasonable estimate of the error bars of the companies estimates or million Their average PC shipment estimate for is while their average for was We can get a reasonable estimate of Windows PC shipments for the two years by subtracting out Apples reported Mac shipments for and and million respectively This yields million Windows PCs shipped in and million in Ive found its even harder to come up with an estimate for Windows tablet sales for Statista and Strategy Analytics seem to agree that the Windows market share was in In the table below I summarize the relevant data shipments in millions The total yy decline for Windows PCs and Tablets was and the yy increase in Windows tablet shipments was about If the trajectory of Windows tablets can be maintained it can start to overcome the decline in traditional PC form factors IDCs report called for another decline for or about million units If and its a big if Windows tablets continue to grow at the yy rate most of this decline would be canceled by Windows tablet growth As the modern PC transitions to the tabletconvertible form factor the companies that benefit are obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Intel The fact that there is a decline says that they still have a tough road ahead but they have the benefit of a large upgrade market in the form of older Windows PCs Apple by virtue of its repudiation of convergence seems to have deliberately locked itself out of this upgrade market While Apple continues to maintain about a million unityear rate of Mac sales iPad sales have been falling As I have pointed out Apples longterm strategy is to position iOS and iPad as its vision of the future of personal computing That vision is falling short competitively in the near term as the iPad continues to lose sales and market share Perhaps the biggest loser in the PC transition is AMD NASDAQ AMD which simply has nothing to offer that is competitive with Intels lower power Skylake offerings AMDs Carrizo for the midpriced notebook market once again seems too little too late as the market pivots to the in I continue to be cautious about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for a number of reasons Windows still needs a lot of work to be a truly well integrated and consistent user interface that works for both touch and mouse or trackpad The objective of converting a billion Windows users to Win appears to be all but out of reach And finally its not at all clear that growth in Windows tablets can be maintained in For these reasons I continue to rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a hold I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
