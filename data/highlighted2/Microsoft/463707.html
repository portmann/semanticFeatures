Alpha Microsofts June quarter earnings report was a mixture of good news in cloud services combined with ongoing revenue decline in the More Personal Computing segment Despite acknowledging that Windows wont achieve the goal of billion users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>offered no plan for converting the over billion Windows users who arent using Win <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT reported another quarter of yy revenue decline to GAAP billion and faces a number of challenges to its operating system dominance as well as lack of presence in smartphones If investors were hoping for some insight on these issues out of the earnings report and conference call there was none to be had The focus was almost exclusively on cloud and productivity services Listening to CEO Nadella it becomes clear that hes very passionate and knowledgeable about cloud computing I dont detect a similar passion let alone sense of urgency when he talks about Windows Its as if hes simply a caretaker for some legacy software Windows which is dead last in his list of priorities It was certainly dead last in his prepared remarks for the conference call He waxed poetic for words on productivity software and cloud services before getting around to the More Personal Computing segment He mentioned the million monthly active devices running Windows and once again touted its adoption rate as the fastest in history He didnt acknowledge what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had acknowledged only last week that Windows would fail to reach its goal of billion active devices More importantly there was no real sense of urgency either about Windows or about Windows phone This despite the continuing implosion of Windows phone revenue down yy Instead there seems to be a sense of relief in putting the Nokia fiasco behind it But absolutely no inkling of where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>goes from here Nadellas statements also convey that enterprise is the chief focus for Windows adoption going forward Microsofts Windows strategy is to deliver more value and innovation particularly for enterprise customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>expects to drive increased adoption for Windows particularly in the enterprise If this sounds familiar this was exactly the same fall back position that Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY tried to pursue with Blackberry when it was clear that consumers were rejecting it Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a much higher probability of success in the enterprise but it still sounds uncomfortably as though the company is giving up on the consumer The emphasis on enterprise seems odd in light of the More Personal Computing MPC Segment results OEM consumer licensing actually grew robustly at yy indicating that new convertible PCs running Win are gaining some traction And thats great devices such as Surface Book and Surface Pro are probably the best solutions for mobile productivity available and are far more useful than Apples NASDAQ AAPL aging notebooks Surface revenue is up almost yy Overall MPC revenue was down yy dragged down by Windows Phone As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has shed costs associated with the Nokia acquisition MPC operating income has grown by almost to million But this ignores the ongoing restructuring and impairment costs which were billion for the quarter and booked under Corporate negative revenue Obviously if the costs associated with the Nokia restructuring had been booked under MPC the story would have been different I agree it doesnt really matter where the costs get booked What does matter is whats the plan now Ive been assuming that there is one and that it involves the rumored Surface Phone but there has been absolutely no discussion of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does once it finishes selling or writing off the last of the Lumia phones It seems a glaring omission but perhaps its just normal secrecy ahead of a new product launch Productivity and Business Processes grew revenue yy to billion but operating income declined by to billion Operating expenses grew due to investments in sales and infrastructure Intelligent Cloud also grew revenue by yy to billion but also suffered a decline in operating income to billion The decline in operating margin is very much driven by the intense competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>faces from the other cloud providers such as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and IBM NYSE IBM Based on the attention focused by analysts during the conference call on cloud services one might construe that growth in cloud related services whether in Productivity or Cloud segments would just overwhelm whatever decline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>faces in personal computing But theres an interesting fact that comes out when you inspect the income statement In the statement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>divides its revenue into Product and Service and other categories Presumably Service and other includes all subscription based productivity software as well as cloud services It turns out that the Service and other category gross margin isnt very good at whereas the Product gross margin is This may say that cloud services may not be the cornucopia that has been assumed Microsofts fundamental problem is how to convert the roughly billion Windows users who are not on Win to a modern Windows platform that has an app store can use Cortana and other advanced services and which can be more effectively monetized <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has acknowledged that Windows is not going to accomplish this Figuring out how to do this should be priority one for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Is the problem so intractable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has simply given up That seems unlikely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>management and CEO Nadella surely understand what is at stake But it doesnt seem that theyve decided on a course of action And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might not want to preview a successor to Windows while still trying to increase the Win user base Any such preview would probably have to wait at least another year As attractive a concept as Surface Phone is it probably doesnt have much leverage on the problem at this stage Its unlikely that Surface Phone could sell in sufficient volume to make up the shortfall Although Nadella mentioned the development of new device categories I really doubt theres anything on the horizon Band or Hololens for example that could close the gap as well It really falls to the Windows successor to win over the current base of Win users Along those lines the ugly thought occurred to me that maybe the reason Win turned out so poorly was that no one in upper management was really paying attention to it While consumers were promised a whole new operating system what they got was a bandaided Windows It just got waved through because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was taking the Windows franchise for granted One could argue that maybe Nadella doesnt need to care about Windows The franchise is secure and Nadella is focused on the growth areas in cloud services There is merit to that and I might almost believe it if it werent for the importance of the smartphone ecosystems The ecosystems of Android and iOS have become the personal computing platforms for most peoples day to day activities including a lot of professional activities The Lumia collapse makes plausible a scenario in which Windows gradually declines over time losing users to newer more robust mobile device ecosystems Windows more than anything is an attempt to emulate the key features of those ecosystems a curated app store search based monetization and AI driven voice response But the lack of a smartphone to host Win besides the now dreadful Lumias is a major headwind to user acceptance and support from developers The relatively small number of Windows Store apps still well under a million by the latest estimate is symptomatic of that lack of developer support I dont think the Windows problem is insoluble at all but faced with a lack of clear direction from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>management investors have to simply hope that everything is going to work out I continue to rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a hold but its become a more cautious hold I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation
