projections tend to assume a continuation of the status quo There is some data that indicates that as smartphone markets mature Apple gains market share IDC has projected Apples NASDAQ AAPL smartphone market share to decline by I believe recent trends in the US and China indicate that Apples longterm prospects are for market share gains As markets mature and their consumers become more discriminating the tendency is for Apple to gain market share IDCs rationale for their projection is that emerging markets such as India and Latin America will fuel growth in the smartphone market to Heres IDCs projection IDC could be right about this but IDC has some history with regard to predictions that the reader may be unaware of Through the wonders of the Internet we can time travel back to September to discover IDCs projection for You wont find this embarrassment on IDCs site anymore I had to dig it up from another site that published the data five years ago Its kind of an interesting alternate reality view of the current market isnt it Sort of The Man in the High Castle of smartphone market predictions IDCs prediction demonstrates the pitfalls of making quantitative predictions so far into the future Theres a natural tendency to linearly extrapolate the current data as well as impose ones own prejudices For instance when you look back at IDCs projections Windows is always gaining market share Some things never change Should the trends of have been really so difficult to spot Its debatable but heres a summary of courtesy Gartner Research I think the table above makes the trends fairly clear Android and iOS are growing explosively in terms of yy unit sales gains Symbian and RIM are gaining yy but losing market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is losing both market share and in yy unit shipments Based on the above table it appears that at least IDC is paying closer attention to their own data Their projection is at least a reasonable extrapolation from the current situation However I believe that theres additional data that suggests that the simple extrapolation is missing the larger trend Here the key factor to consider is how Apple performs in markets as they become mature Mature markets are saturated Consumers all have smartphones and sales are driven by replacement rather than first time purchases Mature markets consist of smartphone consumers that are more educated experienced and discriminating with respect to their purchase decisions As markets mature Apples iPhone makes gains This can be seen in the current situation in China As I discussed recently Apple grew unit shipments by yy in the June quarter According to Kantar WorldPanel data Apples market share has been trending up as the chart below shows As of the June quarter Apple had gained percentage points of market share yy China continues to worry many Apple investors both from a macro economic effect and in terms of Apples competitive position relative to other smartphone vendors Ive addressed the macro situation in a previous article in which I pointed out that the data thats available through the June quarter doesnt suggest China is heading into a recession However Chinese markets are still nervous and many dont believe the data coming from the Chinese government Its certainly possible that a recession could hurt Apple more than lower tier vendors While I understand the concerns I tend to run with the best data I have available and that comes from CEO Tim Cook who sent this message to CNBCs Jim Cramer I get updates on our performance in China every day including this morning and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last two weeks While I cant disprove a theory that says Apples sales in China are about to fall off a cliff a data driven approach mandates waiting for the data from at least the September quarter If we look at the most mature smartphone market in the world the US the indicators also are encouraging c omScore provides what they call market share data for the US Here I have to point out that comScore is using the term loosely A distinction has to be made between percentage of sales for a given quarter what I call market share and percentage of users for a given quarter what I call usage share What comScore reports is really usage share in the US What comScores data shows is that usage share in the US for iOS has been steadily increasing for over a year The changes in percentage terms are not great because the pool of users is quite large For instance in comScores most recent report for July there were million smartphone users in the US I believe there is some data that shows that as smartphone markets mature theres a tendency to swing to Apple thus increasing Apples market share I believe this is due to the inherent superiority of Apples iPhone I know there are many who dont accept this They either think that the quality difference doesnt exist or that it doesnt matter This continues to be one of the principal irreconcilable differences between Apple bears and bulls Even believing as I do its hard to take issue with IDCs forecast This is mainly due to the fact that new emerging markets will have to mature before Apple starts to gain significant market share in them That process will have to run its course but probably will take the next four years So IDC may be right projecting continued market share decline by iOS to and investors may need to look beyond for market share gains However Apples current growth in China may not be adequately accounted for in IDCs data Once again IDCs view may be that recent gains in China by Apple are due to a novelty effect that is assumed to taper off with which I disagree Or they may view the macro economic forces or competitive environment in China as serious headwinds going forward At this point I cant disprove the view that China presents headwinds for Apple but I consider the proof or disproof to be imminent When Apples September quarter earnings come out we should have a very good calibration of Apples sales growth in China as well as the impact of the overall macro environment there Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I
