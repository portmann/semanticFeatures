from Facebook is intended to unleash a kinder gentle and more social sort of bot Until about a couple of weeks ago bots were mostly thought of as the last four letters of a word that began with ro and a concept that even Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL decided might not be ready for prime time Well that is unless youre in Japan where robots dinosaur robots to be precise are now acceptable substitutes for hotel reception staff Who knew the next big thing in hospitality checking in via raptor Theyre software programs that make performing repetitive tasks simple and fast way faster than human beings could ever do Some people use bots to make tasks simple and fast and nefarious For example botnetinduced traffic is responsible for percent of the eyeballs to display ads on the Web burning a billion hole in advertisers pockets for eyeballs that arent and will never buy Sophisticated cybercriminals have also used botnets to release denial of service attacks on sites and steal personal information including bank account numbers Remember ZeuS In fact well reveal a new study soon that will document that botnets have become the No source of online fraud But the announcement last week from Facebook NASDAQ FB is intended to unleash a kinder gentle and more social sort of bot Facebook through Messenger is going all in on chatbots as a tool to engage consumers and give businesses new tools to reach them Its chatbot platform they hope will spawn an ecosystem of developers who will find a variety of use cases to make bots a better and more lucrative use of their time then developing apps for the Apple and Android ecosystem Hey brand want a better way to engage with your customer Find a developer and let them grab Messengers bot API Then you too can have a presence in an ecosystem with a builtin audience of million monthly users Chatbots will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to make the humantomachine interactions inside of that ecosystem both conversational and natural As Messenger chief David Marcus told The New York Times Were conversational creatures Thats the way our brain functions And Messenger and Marcus big bet is that its chatbots will provide a mechanism for brands to strike up those conversations with their community faster cheaper and as well if not better than a live person can do now Which makes their move into bots less about the chat and more about the ecosystem that they hope to create and control using it The notion of conversational human to machine interactions isnt all that new either The English computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing believed that computers had the capability to think like humans and converse with them without a human on the other end knowing that the person they were speaking with really wasnt one His Turing Test was the threshold for whether a computer could in fact mimic human intelligence Turing believed that teaching computers to think begins with basic childlike interactions made richer as computers were taught more context based on more interactions The broader the context the more complicated it is for machines to master those conversations the more narrow the more straightforward For more on Turing you can read the book Enigma or go watch The Imitation Game Chatbots are very much in beta today and still somewhat very rudimentary in their interactions as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can attest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>too is doubling down on chatbots and its CEO believes that they will soon displace apps as the enabling platform for organizing and accessing information But as their first public foray into that world with Tay shows theres a lot for these chatbots to learn or in Tays case unlearn Tay was a very bad girl when she was first introduced to the world and is now grounded until she can learn to behave in a much more respectful fashion My own experience with one of Facebooks chatbots Hi Poncho the weather chatbot was a bit like dealing with a petulant child too I never did get the answer to what I thought was a simple question on Saturday afternoon Whats the weather going to be on Monday April for the Boston Marathon But I was amused at first by the funny hipster cat banter until I got annoyed when it was clear that Poncho was not able to answer my question and gave me the runaround I stuck with it for about minutes because I wanted to get the experience but most people are probably not that patient Going to my Weather Channel app is more accurate and faster but admittedly not as entertaining Once Poncho can match accuracy with his fun hipster cat banter maybe Ill give him another try But the bigger point here isnt whether Messenger can perfect the hipster cat weather persona Its whether chatbots are its onramp to controlling an ecosystem that makes relevant information easier for people to discover and consume Of course where consumers are having conversations these days is inside of messaging apps and via text Who needs to talk to anyone anymore when a text is just as good And who uses Facebook itself anymore to really communicate with their friends Even if you tried your message would be buried in a fusillade of ads in the newsfeed eMarketer says that percent of smartphone users use messaging apps at least once a month usage that has spiked considerably over the last five years Smartphones just make texting as easy as typing Businesses use it as a way to communicate too Everything from flight status to shipping updates come now via SMS Consumers use it as a way to connect with friends and make plans something that Zuckerberg and Facebook increasingly saw as a threat to its core social networking platform Facebooks billion acquisition of messaging platform WhatsApp a messaging platform that lost million the year before was its first step to both extending its footprint into messaging and preventing someone else from getting control of that asset Facebooks stock jumped percent in the months after the acquisition was announced Shortly thereafter Facebook spun out Messenger which wasnt doing much of anything within Facebook and simultaneously hired former PayPal CEO David Marcus to further fortify its messaging ecosystem But unlike WhatsApp which has not been the object of any significant attempts to make money Messenger and Marcus have channeled their inner WeChat muse to develop and monetize its own social network inside of a messaging platform WeChat with million monthly active users is the most influential social network in China Its almost exclusively where Chinese consumers communicate with each other Businesses can be part of WeChat too and can advertise their products or services directly to consumers Im told by my colleagues in China who use it regularly that WeChat is not a place to discover things like a search platform but a place to get relevant information from brands that consumers request updates from They also tell me that they use separate apps outside of WeChat to buy tickets products and order taxis etc Tencent OTCPKTCEHY WeChats parent company has been very careful about how its introduced schemes to monetize its million monthly users Gaming is the predominant way that its revenues are earned today and they are contemplating other ideas now Job two is devising ways to monetize that engagement that arent adbased and pushed out but at the permission of the consumers and pulled through Messenger appears to be taking a page out of that playbook with chatbots and its latest play to engage brands users and leverage one of the most powerful forces in digital today apps Worldwide smartphone penetration is approaching percent In the US comScore reports that percent of those years of age own a smartphone percent of those to percent of those to and even percent of those over the age of do as well If you want all the scoop on the massive move to mobile read this piece by MPD Founder David S Evans and a couple of his economist colleagues Mobile apps drive more than half percent of time online a trend that accounts for twothirds of all growth in digital media On average consumers use apps a month but download many more over the course of the year that languish on the mobiles home screen unused Consumers really only use apps Facebook Messenger and YouTube Those three apps account for out of every minutes on mobile That means that those other apps arent getting a lot of eyeballs and its getting increasingly harder for new apps to break into that top Unless of course you can figure out a way to get your app inside of an ecosystem which gets a lot of eyeballs already Chatbots are Messengers initial step toward a much bigger end game than simply making it possible for consumers to check the weather from Hi Poncho get news headlines from CNN and order flowers from Flowers Messengers chatbot V is about getting consumers used to thinking of Messenger as the place they can go to interact with brands a onestop shop for talking to their friends and the brands they like or want to get to know A place where they can initiate that engagement and not be served ads like they are now on Facebook Chatbot v though is where it could get interesting Messenger I think is hoping to parlay the consumers love affair with messaging and mobile time spent inside of Messengers ecosystem and brands concerns over consumer app fatigue into creating an uber platform that simplifies access to relevant information The play potentially is to create an interface inside of Messenger that gives consumers access to what they want without having to wade through or download hundreds or even thousands of apps which consumers just dont do anymore The bet that Messenger is making is that consumers will want to do that inside of messaging and specifically inside of Messenger because thats where conversations among consumers happen today And where conversations with brands can happen tomorrow Creating a sort of a your information wish is my command center with an easy to use interface to make it seamless efficient and comprehensive Its a big bet But not an implausible one For the bet to pay off Messenger will have convince consumers that Messenger is that hub for all of the information thats relevant to them instead of one of their favorite apps Or one of the other players lining up to do the same thing The Growing Rise Of The Closed Ecosystem Making closed ecosystems aka walled gardens more useful so that consumers stay comfortably ensconced in them is in vogue Apple the undisputed king of closed ecosystems has said that it will soon make apps searchable Siri today uses voice to help iOS users do and find things easily Google with Google Now and Play one of the Top apps on mobile in position No and Google Voice is leveraging the strength of its massive search ecosystem to do the same Its open in the sense that Google can be accessed everywhere But it would like to make everything that you want to do happen inside of a Google app that can be accessed anywhere Google Android Windows you name it Messengers million active users each month sounds pretty incredible until you consider that Google sees billion searches every month Then theres Amazons Alexa which is using voice and a growing ecosystem of developers to create skills intended to make Alexa and Amazon ever more consumerfriendly too Alexa and its growing repository of information and services coupled with Amazon and its growing roster of merchants and consumers puts a commerce spin on its ecosystem Amazon all by itself is the No retail app on mobile with million visits a month and brings with it engagement via its million plus accountholders who are ready to buy and from a variety of merchants that now include luxury designers But step back and think about what Facebook has managed to pull off and what its future could hold if its messaging app bets pay off After being slammed for being a mobile luddite following its bungled IPO in Facebook has managed to become the Godzilla of mobile apps making more percent of its humongous ad revenue on mobile Then it managed to get control of the two largest messaging apps in the world outside of China with WhatsApp and the spin out of its Messenger App at the exact same time when lots of people particularly millennials were shifting into messaging Its creating a parallel universe for Facebook with messaging in which all the communication between people and businesses will be within its walls If theyre successful then all theyll need to worry about is how Apple might react to hosting such a powerful closed ecosystem inside of its own since it has similar intentions Perhaps thats why one of the other things that Facebook announced last week too was its hire away from Google to lead a hardware division Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology
