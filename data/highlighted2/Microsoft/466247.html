post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE in New York City US June Yahoo Inc YHOOO is focusing on US telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc VZN as the buyer of its core business after reviewing final bids that it received this week people familiar with the matter said on Friday A deal would boost Verizons AOL internet business which the company acquired last year for billion by giving it access to Yahoos advertising technology tools as well other assets such as search mail messenger and real estate These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company leaving it only as the owner of a percent stake in Yahoo Japan as well as its percent interest in Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABAN Those two stakes account for most of Yahoos billion market capitalization Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value but negotiations between the two companies are continuing and no agreement has yet been reached the sources said Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end

directors associated with him would join its board immediately All four were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoos entire board Started in by Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and
