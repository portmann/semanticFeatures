dividend increase Due to its free cash flow generation and low payout ratio AAPL is ripe for a solid raise But the level of the increase might be smaller than some expect Apples hands are tied because the vast majority of its cash is held offshore And management prefers to utilize the bulk of its capital returns for share buybacks Each year in April Apple NASDAQ AAPL updates its capital return program While the company does pay a dividend which yields slightly less than its past two annual dividend increases were below what one would normally expect from such a prodigious cash flow generator At first glance there seems to be no reason why Apple cant raise its dividend by or more After all other technology giants with less impressive growth in recent years such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO have had little trouble raising their own dividends by in recent years But there are some very significant caveats Apple investors need to know particularly for those who want AAPL to raise its dividend at a high rate Apple is very likely to hike its dividend again this month but heres why investors should temper their expectations Apple generated billion of free cash flow in the first quarter alone Despite not having a major new iPhone release to benefit from the company still grew revenue by The results would have been even better if not for the strengthening US dollar constantcurrency revenue increased This was a very healthy growth rate in a challenging global environment And Apple is generating solid growth from new products and services Apples Services business which includes iTunes the App Store Apple Pay and Apple Music grew revenue by year over year Separately revenue from Apples Other category which includes the Apple Watch iPod Beats and the Apple TV was up In fiscal the company generated a whopping billion in free cash flow up from billion the previous year Its free cash flow growth over the past several years is truly a thing to behold Last year the company distributed billion in dividends which equated to a minuscule payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow And yet Apple raised its dividend by last year and by the year before Those are decent enough increases if this were a stodgy consumer staples company But for a company with the growth and financial strength of Apple these raises likely disappointed income investors and they set a precedent for AAPL shareholders not to get carried away when it comes to the dividend A lot has been made of Apples massive cash pile Indeed the company held billion in cash shortterm investments and longterm investments on its balance sheet at the end of last quarter In theory this cash would be a natural choice for supplying investors with higher dividends But unfortunately while Apples huge cash hoard is certainly impressive its largely not available for dividends because the vast majority of it is held offshore billion of it to be exact In order to bring this cash home to use for dividends Apple would be subject to a significant repatriation tax It has understandably shown little to no desire to do this The next rational step then if Apple were still intent on giving investors a large dividend raise would be to take out debt and use the proceeds to fund its dividend program It has already done this and Apples balance sheet reflects its use of leverage in recent years In fact at the end of last quarter Apple had billion in total debt on its balance sheet Compare that to Apples financial condition as recently as the second quarter of when it had zero total debt Expect A Raise But Dont Get Too Excited Not only is Apples ability to raise its dividend by a large amount hindered by the fact that most of its cash is held offshore and that it has already levered up its balance sheet but investors also need to remember that management prefers to utilize the majority of its capital returns in the form of share repurchases Since Apple embarked on its current capital allocation program in late it has so far returned billion to investors just billion of it for dividends and the remainder for share repurchases Indeed share buybacks have been an increasingly large slice of the Apple pie As a result Apples ability and desire to provide stronger dividend raises may not align with investor expectations I fully expect Apple to raise its dividend once again this month but keep in mind this isnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or Cisco Expect Apples dividend raise to be closer to than Disclaimer This article represents the opinion of the author who is not a licensed financial advisor This article is intended for informational and educational
