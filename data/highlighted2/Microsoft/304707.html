within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Today there was a news story about how an Activist Investor wants JJ to break up into three companies There is no major reason why investors should approve of splitting up one of the most stable and diverse companies in the market In this article I will be looking at how activist investors or analysts have pressured the highestquality companies to breakupspinoff assets and why those plans have been and are a poor idea The three examples I will be looking at are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Exxon NYSE XOM and Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ The reason I chose these companies is that they are the only AAArated companies remaining and each has faced pressure to breakupspinoff Just today there was a news story that activist investor Artisan Partners is pressuring JNJ to split into three standalone companies which I believe is a poor idea For example the last company to lose its AAA rating was Automatic Data Processing NASDAQ ADP in because they spunoff a unit of their business The reason for dropping the AAA rating for ADP given by Moodys the diminished scale and variety of ADPs products increases the companys credit risk Simply put ADP lost its rating because its business was less diverse and shrunk in scale after the spinoff As one of three AAArated companies JNJ is widely known as one of the highestquality companies worldwide In addition with consecutive years of dividend increases JNJ is the foundation of many income dividendgrowth portfolios and breaking up the company would in my opinion have a negative impact on future dividendgrowth JNJs business is diversified both geographically and by business segment The first chart below from the most recent earnings report shows that JNJ is nearly split on business inside the United States and outside the United States The second chart shows the three business segments that JNJ operates in and as you can see the underlying business is very diverse The final reason why I believe JNJ should not cave to activist pressure is that the company has a number of significant platformsbrands that generate a large portion of sales for the company As you can see in the third chart below JNJ has brandsplatforms that generate at least billion in sales each year I believe having all those brandsplatforms under one roof is beneficial to JNJ and its shareholders especially during times of economic stress After Conoco Phillips NYSE COP splitoff Phillips NYSE PSX there was pressure and rumors from analysts that Exxon should follow suit and spin off its refining business as Conoco did In a fellow contributor wrote an article about just that subject Exxon Mobil Time To Break It Up And Slim It Down With the oil market dropping off a cliff Exxon has shown that they were correct in not going with the shortterm trend of spinning off downstream or midstream assets to create shortterm shareholder value Just like with ADP if Exxon were to have split off its refining business it would have lost scale become less diverse and been in danger of losing its AAA rating Because Exxon has a AAA rating they can access the debt markets during these depressed oil prices if they needed funds for an acquisition of quality assets that are trading at a depressed price Once again that shows that thinking for the long term can provide opportunities that would possibly not be available if Exxon had gone with the shortterm trend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>just like JNJ has received pressure from activists in the past to spinoff its consumer related businesses Activist firm ValueAct took a position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in early to push for changes in the company In addition for years there has been pressure on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to spinoff its XBox division this occurred when Steve Ballmer was still the CEO and even after Satya Nadella was named CEO After Satya Nadella was named CEO in a memo sent out in July he stated We are fortunate to have Xbox in our family to go after this opportunity with unique and bold innovation Then after HP NYSE HP announced they would be splitting into two companies analysts and activists once again started calling for a split of the consumer and commercial businesses for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>As I have shown all three of these companies earned their AAA rating by planning for the long term and not worrying about shortterm issues like activist pressure or following shortterm market trends that competitors are following I strongly believe that Johnson Johnson should ignore Artisan Partners and rule out the possibility of splitting up the company as it would most likely lead to a loss of its topnotch credit rating and affect the stability and dividend growth of the resulting threestandalone companies I believe the history of ADP losing its AAA credit rating and the pressures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Exxon have resisted shows that staying a large scale and diverse company is the superior way to go Tagged Investing Ideas Healthcare </div></body></html>
