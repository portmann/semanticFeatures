settings or contact your network administrator Earlier this year Facebook announced it would dip its toes into the pool of mobile payments by launching a system that allowed users to send money to friends via the Messenger app Now it appears the company maytakethings a bit farther after receiving approval for a patent this week that would allow creditors to determine whether or not someone is worthy of a loan based on their circle of friends on the social networking site The patent which was actually applied for by Facebook back in August is for a system of authorization and authentication based on an individuals social network It could have several uses including filtering out spam email and offensive content and improving searches on the site However its the use related to approving or denying a loan request based on the friends you keep that is a bit worrisome When an individual applies for a loan the lender examines the credit ratings of members of the individuals social network who are connected to the individual through authorized nodes connections the patent states If the average credit rating of these members is at least a minimum credit score the lender continues to process the loan application Otherwise the loan application is rejected According to the patent the lender would be able to access a potential borrowers social circle by submitting a request for information from Facebooks databases They would then receive a series of lists grey black and white that would be used to determine the average credit score for the wouldbe borrowers friends The process for Facebook loan approval Click To Enlarge While the recently patented process seems pretty straightforward the practical implications raiseseveral questions and concerns For one thing just because youre friends on Facebook doesnt meanthat person has any impact on your everyday life or influence over your financial habits The patent doesnt detail how a lender would weed out potential social network connections thatmight not have a significant influenceon the borrower like that longlost high school classmate you havent actually seen in years Additionally the patent doesnt provide a clear explanation for what the data provided related to connections includes If its just a credit score without a report that lists debts or defaults how is one to know that the consumer hasnt been unfairly penalized for things like medical debt But perhaps the biggest concern is the fact that numerous studies have found information culled online to create credit profiles for consumers are often inaccurate Last year the National Consumer Law Center published a report that found that most credit reports generated by data brokers using information found online were riddled with errors Seven of the consumer reports generated by eBureau a company that touts advanced big data models contained errors in estimated income The reports nearly doubled the salary of one participant and halved the salary of another Additionally of the reports incorrectly stated the consumers education level Despite these concerns it possible that the new patent wont even see the light of day just because a patent is granted doesnt mean a company has the intention to actually use it And as CNN points out the Equal Credit Opportunity Act strictly regulates what criteria income expenses debts and credit history creditors can use when deciding if a consumer is worthy of a loan Its nothing to lose sleep over for people with decent credit history but it could potentially affect those who are borderline
