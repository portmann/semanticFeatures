class='textDiv'>What Apple Watch Evaluating Fitbit After Q Fitbit Inc NYSEFIT Seeking Alpha Fitbits sales were not hurt by the release of the Apple Watch in Q Not only did Fitbits sales rise but their margins remained high and they entered corporate wellness agreements with Geico Transunion and other companies Fitbit has room to expand in the fitnesstracking space and their strong fundamentals provide an opportunity to enter new markets Now that Fitbit NYSE FIT has posted their first earnings report and existed alongside the Apple Watch and other new competitors for a quarter its a good time to reassess their performance and potential The stock already has rewarded early investors since I issued a buy call two months ago at But is Fitbit still a good purchase And perhaps most importantly where will future growth come from First lets examine the market trends Just before Fitbits IPO in May I wrote that investors shouldnt worry about the Apple Watch because Fitbit and Apple NASDAQ AAPL werent competing over the same market Instead I wrote that the wearable industry was going to segment into three distinct broad categories Heres how I broke it down Smart clothing that relays muscleactivation data and breathing patterns Multipurpose devices such as the Apple Watch which are primarily smartphone extensions While many commentators assumed the Apple Watch would eat into Fitbits market share this has not been the case This isnt because the Apple Watch is a poor product but because its targeted at a different market Fitbit is focused exclusively on the fitness and personal health space while the Apple Watch is a multipurpose device and a smartphone extension Apple didnt release sales numbers for the Apple Watch in their Q report but based on the billion revenue growth in their other segment most analysts peg the number at somewhere around million Fitbit meanwhile sold million fitness devices up from million yearoveryear and remained the default leader in the fitnesstracking category In other words the Apple Watch is not encroaching on Fitbits market In fact theres not even evidence to support the idea that potential Fitbit customers are delaying their purchases in order to try out the Apple Watch or other smartwatches This is probably due to Fitbits lower price point which falls squarely in the impulse buy range and different usecases What market is the Apple Watch encroaching on Traditional watches Watch sales declined in June the largest drop since although the Apple Watch is likely not the sole reason for this This does further reinforce the separatemarket theory though smartwatches may be seen as a replacement for traditional timepieces but have not established themselves as attractive fitness tracking devices While many companies especially in consumer goods have to sacrifice margins while they scale their products Fitbit has managed to expand while keeping margins high They slipped just yearoveryear from to Given that revenue rose from million to million over the same period this should not be cause for concern Over the first six months of gross margin actually edged up to from in the same period the year before For Fitbit to be able to maintain such margins in the face of increased competition from companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Garmin NASDAQ GRMN demonstrates their success in building a loyal customer base and creating a moat around their offerings Their growing online community and popular brand are two components of this Brand awareness is a large factor among consumers and among corporations As companies expand or start corporate wellness programs name recognition will play a role in securing such partnerships During Q Fitbit continued their streak of corporate success entering into agreements with Geico Quicken Loans and Transunion among others These agreements not only boost their device sales but also help expand their brand among consumers through wordofmouth advertising and increased exposure Given their solid market position and rising sales its encouraging to see that Fitbit has continued to invest in RD Their research and development expenses rose by from million to million General and administrative meanwhile roughly doubled from million to million Upping their expense on RD while keeping general and administrative under control revenue rose by in the same period demonstrates a focused and forwardlooking management team As to their future theres plenty of territory left to exploit in the dedicated fitnesstracking space Fitbits upcoming pipeline will no doubt reflect that Perhaps more importantly Fitbits solid fundamentals provide them with an opportunity to enter new markets Fitbit ended Q with million in cash up from million yearoveryear Cash assets give companies cushion to explore new strategies andor markets or withstand downturns In this case Fitbit should pursue the dedicated healthdevice market This is a large underserved market right now due to the complexity of medical device regulations which is itself worth an entire article and the time required to take a product to market However there also are huge opportunities for companies that enter this market early Fitbits hardware design prowess could give them a huge advantage in designing usable intuitive health devices for proactive treatment of neurological conditions diabetes or other chronic illnesses Fitbit remains in a strong position and has faced little competition from the Apple Watch or other multipurpose smartwatches Despite a growing number of competitors Fitbits sales rose by over yearoveryear while margins remained solid Their continued investment in research and development and the largely untapped opportunity presented by dedicated healthdevices gives Fitbit continued room for expansion Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
