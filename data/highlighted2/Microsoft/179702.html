the Nadella regime took control <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has worked hard to message to the market that it is the productivity suite for all use cases SMB or enterprise But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still missing a capable productproject management tech that addresses its entire suite of platforms Aha can help with this With its recent VoloMetrix acquisition setting the table <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can also further its human capital manager productivity suite image by deploying Aha on an expanded basis Its time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to have its Aha moment What do I mean by that I mean its finally time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to integrate Aha a productproject management startup tech thats already integrated into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Visual Studio TFS across its broader platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is clearly as evidenced by its recent acquisition of VoloMetrix among a handful of other strategic executions positioning itself as the human capital manager productivity suite and Aha would only embellish this Ahas specialty is in holding the human capital accountable as well as holding the mission critical processes at the SMBenterprise on course Both of course go hand in hand which is why I think Aha makes sense as a paired expansion to VoloMetrix from a tech standpoint for Microsofts model Again Microsofts goal is to be viewed as having a great productivity suite sure but also as the single productivity suite than can help you better manage your business Aha makes sense for this and needs to be let loose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is intent on proving out itself as the platform for increasing SMBenterprise productivity in a noncommoditized way VoloMetrix bringing organizational analytics tech to Microsofts model will go a long way in furthering that as detailed in my note on the acquisition of the tech and Aha seems like a natural next step Yes strategic business planning is less defensive in barrier to entry than something analytics engine based read VoloMetrix but what Aha has been able to do with its tech in the early going has been nothing to look past Aha just recently expanded its use cases with a new Business Model Builder capacity that is unique and should be able to give those platforms with integration a first mover advantage I get that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>isnt trying to add commoditized products or products that could easily become commoditized if it pays for something it wants high visibility at least at the time what is high visibility into having a competitive advantage from the tech I totally get this and I also get that Aha has competitors and were not talking about a super hard to replicate tech I say this loosely in knowing that all tech is hard to develop But again Aha is working itself down its product roadmap and has shown some really good stuff so far the staff at Aha is talented and my guess is the product roadmap has plenty of upside left in it I just dont view this as being that risky when viewing it as a potential race to zero tech I just dont see it that way I think that as with VoloMetrixs tech having a first mover advantage in dropping a serious strategic business planning solution into a model like that of Microsofts will in fact provide a first mover advantage Even if commoditized take a look at Salesforcecom NYSE CRM CRM has been commoditized but it still retains its massive customer base and its huge ecosystem based advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can take the platform power user in terms of the broader productivity suite a guy like myself even deeper into the ecosystem while also capturing the fringe user looking for a single use case Ahas Business Model Builder product will help with that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been making a serious run at the SMB with its freemium everything initiative even solutions that probably dont need to be freemium Power BI is an example are in an effort to simply grow usage and familiarity Aha having Business Model Builder is huge for SMBs I work with startups and small companies every day and at least of them have none or only a very loosely structured illustrated easy to hold accountable business model Most of these companies are operating from the founders brain this is not an exaggeration Aha changes that With Business Model Builder <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can theoretically service just about all SMB base needs for less than y inclusive of Office Power BI Desktop insert VoloMetrix insert Aha etc It just makes sense If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wants to capture the SMB what easier way than to be the platform with which the underlying business model is planned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could do this in several ways by content pack buildout by full scale deep integration basically building Aha into the fiber of its platforms or by buying Aha outright and applying the tech via deep integration but without the double branding and what I presume is closed ended architecture that comes with renting rather than owning From what I understand about Aha it isnt in the business of tailoring its platform per integration I just think that Aha would ask <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to be responsible for most of the integration work rather than the other way around At that point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should just consider taking Aha out which is what I would recommend anyway There are some things I would change about Aha if I were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>but overall its the best in the business for what its used for I think it could be even better if used across an expansive customer base in that there could be a huge expansion of use cases to the solution This becomes especially true when thinking about taking Ahas talent and giving it a bit of Microsofts budget This was a big reason for the VoloMetrix acquisition by the way the what could they do with our budget question Im all over the SMBenterprise solution space on a regular basis as I have to regularly deploy solutions as a part of my consulting business Nobody is currently addressing the base foundation of the SMB thats the actual business model Maybe this is because the take rates could potentially be low with founders believing they dont need a solution to remember or map out what they have planned for their business Maybe this is because foundersmanagers dont believe anybody under the Csuitefounder level should have that type of granular access to the business model Who knows But the point to be made here is that I would have and will have plenty of folks using this platform in that its simply a good idea from an efficiency and accountability standpoint to have the model mapped out visually I think at the very least this could help prevent wasted man hours andor creative hours read RD spending marketing spending etc A dialed in plan is never a bad idea I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could do well coupling Aha especially with Business Model Builder with its broader SMB and human capital manager productivity suite initiatives Its a technology thats already inhouse and its one that appeals to both the power user as well as the new user Its time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to have its Aha moment Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
