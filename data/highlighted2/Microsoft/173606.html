style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was highly criticized after its last earnings report based on a massive loss due to its failed Nokia acquisition But underneath the headlines in fiscal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continued to do what it does best generate huge amounts of free cash flow Its high free cash flow is the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can continue to lavish investors with doubledigit dividend increases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>increased its dividend by on September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQ MSFT has struggled this year as investors continue to have a hard time digesting its last earnings report which looked very weak at first glance The company suffered a huge loss due to a very large writedown Combine that with the fears of slowing economic growth in the emerging markets and its easy to see why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>stock is in correction territory down from its week high But the company continues to be an excellent dividend growth stock On September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced a dividend increase That might not seem logical at first given its decline in GAAP diluted earnings per share last year But underneath the negative headlines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continued to generate huge free cash flow This is the far more important number for investors to focus on and free cash flow is the reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can deliver such outstanding dividend growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>got a lot of criticism after reporting fiscal fourthquarter earnings Indeed on the surface the headline numbers looked bad It recorded a huge billion net loss but its important to note that this was due entirely to a billion impairment charge related to the Nokia device acquisition Excluding all the various onetime charges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would have earned per share That would have represented yearoveryear growth so put differently Microsofts results were quite strong when evaluating the core underlying business The reason for Microsofts impressive core results is that the company has made huge strides in newer highergrowth businesses Formerly a PCdependent entity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has effectively transitioned itself quite an impressive feat considering how huge of a company it is For example cloud revenue soared or excluding foreign exchange and reached an annualized rate that exceeds billion due to the continued success of Office Azure and Dynamics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is enjoying broadbased growth across its other products as well Tablet revenue grew yearoveryear as the Surface Pro continues to sell very well Xbox revenue increased and last but not least search revenue rose as Bing captured an additional basis points of search share year over year The key takeaway from all this is that its more valuable for investors to keep focus on free cash flow and not the headline EPS numbers Analyzing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the context of free cash flow paints a vastly better picture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is simply a cash flow machine Despite the huge writedown that captured the news headlines the bigger news should have been that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>generated billion of free cash flow last quarter and billion of free cash flow in fiscal Mountain Of Cash Paves The Way For Higher Dividends All that cash is piling up on the balance sheet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now holds billion in cash shortterm investments and longterm investments up from billion this point last year And the company carries a modest debt load Its longterm debt to equity ratio is a very manageable With so much cash flow and not a lot of debt to worry about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can easily afford to increase its dividend The companys free cash flow payout ratio stood at just for fiscal Including its updated dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has now raised its dividend by compounded annually over the past five years The stock now offers investors a yield based on its new dividend payout Thanks to Microsofts excellent growth rates in its newer cloudbased businesses as well as continued success in Microsofts hardware and other businesses it has more than enough financial flexibility to raise its dividend at high rates There are simply very few stocks that can match Microsofts unique blend of a high current yield as well as high dividend growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is an excellent holding for income investors of all sorts Whether you are a retiree looking for income now or a dividend growth investor with a long time horizon there are few better dividend stocks out there than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Disclaimer This article represents the opinion of the author It is intended
