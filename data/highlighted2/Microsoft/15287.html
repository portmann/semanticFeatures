business faces new threats and has little upside in ARPU GOOGs Android is likely losing some market share to AAPL which could have a domino effect Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is still an unquestioned king in Silicon Valley but over the last year or so there has been several reasons to believe it is losing its luster Specifically there are five reasons I wouldnt own it The biggest concern I have is regarding Googles biggest business its near billion a year advertising business Google has an average revenue per user ARPU well over wheras Facebooks NASDAQ FB is just in North America and Twitter NYSE TWTR and LinkedIns NYSE LNKD is far less than that This naturally creates the question of how much upside remains for Googles advertising business when competitors are charging so much less with very effective advertising products Furthermore Google might soon face new competition The Wall Street Journal reported WSJ registration required at link last August that Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN is prepping an advertising platform for both its own site and thirdparty sites In the past Amazoncom had used Google to sponsor ads on its site to the tune of billion worth of ads last year Thus Google will lose that business and gain a new competitor if Amazoncom enters the space However for the time being Facebook poses a much greater threat to Google Just recently Facebook announced the launch of a mobile ad exchange that lets publishers sell video and display ads based on Facebooks data This is directly aimed at Googles DoubleClick ad service and its broader advertising empire as Facebook aims to grab a piece of the advertising market excluding its own platform In other words Google now faces real competition in its most important business by a company that has just as much data and as big of a presence as it does Thats scary for Google longs creating a competitive environment where it is tough to imagine Google ARPU rising too much in the future if not falling According to IDC Googles Android operating system controlled over of the global smartphone market at the end of last year However after several years of Android growing its market share in mobile Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone and Plus has begun to reverse the trend This is mostly due to the obsession that global smartphone users have for phablets as Apple now has a device in the phablet space In regards to the effect that Apple is having on Android Cowen recently performed a large study on iPhone and Plus owners in the US China and Japan What it found is that of owners were new to iOS and well over of that were coming from Android Perhaps even more alarming is that Cowen also surveyed consumers who plan to purchase an iPhone Plus over the next months More than of the participants plan to replace their Android with an iPhone during this month span This study supports the theory that Android is losing market share to Apple although we wont know to what degree until first quarter data is announced next month Whats really alarming about Apples betterthanexpected performance with the iPhone is that Android put its best foot forward to combat the demand for iOS products Not only did Google release a new Nexus phone and tablet but LG and Samsung OTCSSNLF both released new phones near Apples launch of the iPhone Yet for Samsung in particular sales last year were still flat versus That said there are legitimate indications that Google is beginning to lose its magic touch with Android even with app developers Most recently Facebook unveiled Messenger Platform at its f conference and despite Android being the more dominant operating system globally Messenger Platform is currently only compatible with iOS Thats kind of a slap to the face of Google by a company that essentially dominates applications across both Android and iOS As a result if developers start to sway against Android due to the innovations and flexibility of iOS for developers and Android begins to lose global market share Google investors must worry about Plays revenue outlook Googles Other revenue which includes Android Nexus and cloud services created almost billion of the companys billion during the fourth quarter growing yearoveryear Due to Androids market share Google Play has more app downloads per quarter than Apple according to App Annie However App Annie also estimates that the App Store created more revenue than Google Play last year mainly because engagement is higher on iPhones and therefore iOS devices consume far more data than Android devices In other words iPhone users spend more time on their apps than Android users As a result it is crucial for Google to maintain its dominance in the mobile world as Google Play is its only monetization of Android Given the trends that are weighing in iOS favor I am particularly worried that Google Play revenue could start to weigh on Googles Other business Lastly Googles YouTube faces a much more competitive world than in years past and specifically Facebook has become a legitimate threat YouTube has been given a valuation of up to billion by several analysts meaning it is very important to Googles market capitalization yet the company doesnt even report financial information for YouTube As a result analysts are left to speculate as to just how successful YouTube is as a platform While several analysts figure that YouTube is responsible for over of Googles total ad revenue The Information reported last year that YouTubes expected ad revenue growth rate of was actually closer to and that Googles gross ad revenue from YouTube was just billion One reason that YouTube might be experiencing some growing pains is because of increased competition for the first time ever YouTubes share of video uploads on Facebook declined last year Unfortunately no one knows for sure but if in fact YouTube begun to experience some growth issues last year it is likely because platforms such as Netflix continue to grow while media companies like CNBC and ESPN emphasize their own streaming content social media platforms Facebook and Twitter also put some skin in the video game Furthermore Facebook has become a meaningful presence in video having over three billion video views daily on its platform most of which are very similar to the content viewed on YouTube Thats why Facebooks recently announced embeded videos could be a big problem for YouTube Currently Google still capitalizes on the billions of views it gains outside of the YouTube platform due to the sharing of videos Up until now Facebooks videos were only available on its own platform but moving forward Facebook will allow the sharing of its video content to other sites just like YouTube So if in fact YouTubes growth is slowing this could be yet another reason to worry With all things considered there are major red flags and concerns for every one of Googles primary businesses What makes this so bad is that for the first time it is hard to see where Googles next big thing will come from Certainly Google has the broadband service Fiber but cant afford to outspend ATT NYSE T to the tune of billion to offer services throughout the entire country Furthermore Google remains a distant fourth place behind Amazoncom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and IBM in cloud infrastructure services an industry where topline growth has been pressured due to widespread discounting within the space Also the companys initiatives with payments went nowhere Glass has been a disappointment and excitement stemming from selfdriving cars its infamous barge and Android Wear has all but fizzled away As a result I find it increasingly difficult to justify a valuation north of x forward earnings for Google or x free cash flow This is especially true when big tech companies that pay dividends and buyback stock like Apple and Qualcomm are trading at just x next years earnings In other words Google is just too expensive given all of the risk and thats ultimately the deciding factor for why I would not buy the stock at any point in the near future Source Google Big Reasons I Would Not Own
