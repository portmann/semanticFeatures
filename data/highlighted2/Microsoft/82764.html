beta on a couple of iPads multitasking appears to just work With iOS Apple has positioned the iPad to be what the Mac only aspired to the computer for the rest of us iOS did not turn out to be the incremental improvement that many were expecting prior to WWDC Instead it is an almost complete rebuild that is faster and more efficient while adding a host of new capabilities The most important new capability is multitasking which takes advantage of Apples NASDAQ AAPL leadership in bit mobile processors iOS positions Apple to challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT for dominance of personal computing My assessment of iOS is based on direct experience using it for the past couple of days on a pair of iPads I keep for development and testing purposes an iPad and an iPad Mini The most immediate evidence of the rebuilding of iOS is in the install size of the OS which has shrunk from over GB to about GB in the beta Apple is promising that this will be down to GB by the time of the public release The iPad was never really very happy with iOS and it seemed to get bogged down on even simple things such as web page loading iOS has given the iPad a new lease on life and the it just works feeling has returned It appears that the issues many observed with WiFi performance and the Safari browser have been resolved in Not surprisingly the new multitasking features of iOS are unavailable on iPad It appears that only Apple iPads running Apples first and second gen bit processors will get the benefit of multitasking If anyone has any doubts about the value of bit processors for mobile devices these doubts should now be laid to rest The iPad mini has a retina display and an A bit processor so I was able to test some multitasking on it Multitasking in iOS encompasses three features called Slide Over Split View and video Picture in Picture Split View is only available on the iPad Air which features what has been Apples most powerful mobile processor the Ax Slide Over and Picture in Picture worked beautifully on the Mini Apple has devised what is probably the most convenient UI mechanism to get into its multitasking mode a simple swipe from the left edge of the screen Picture in Picture worked surprisingly well on the Mini which I didnt expect Apples intimate knowledge of its bit processors combined with long experience with building true bit operating systems for them has put Apple out in front of Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android in multitasking A recent article in Ars Technica demonstrated the state of multitasking in Googles next generation Android M debuted at their recent IO developers conference Unlike iOS Ars Technica found that multitasking in M just didnt work There are a host of other improvements that Apple has made but let me just mention one of them that I found very intriguing since it bears on iOS as a productivity platform Android has long had mouse cursor capability for devices equipped with a track pad or an added on mouse Likewise Windows has this built in Why would you want this for a touchscreen device Sometimes it turns out to be the most convenient user input mechanism especially when working with text If youve tried to perform text selection or editing on a touchscreen you know what I mean Even though iPad has more than sufficient processing power to support editing text documents and has numerous apps for that purpose its a cumbersome chore on the iPad that I only use for emergencies Apples new built in on screen keyboard tries to solve this by transforming into a track pad Pressing two fingers on the keyboard puts it into track pad mode and a text insertion cursor appears on the screen which can be moved using track pad mode anywhere on the screen In this mode I was able to select and edit blocks of text much more easily Apple has resisted any form of convergence in its rather dogmatic antiWindows stance But some convergence will be required to compete with Windows tablets as productivity devices Track pad mode may be a baby step in the direction of convergence but some convergence is inevitable As I pointed out in my WWDC preview article multitasking on the iPad is another example of convergence once again driven by competitive pressure from Windows tablets This competitive pressure will only intensify with Windows and new generations of Windows tablets running Skylake Intel processors After reflection the conspicuous absence of multitasking for iPhone seems a little odd Granted split screen mode might be pretty useless for iPhone but Slide Over and Picture in Picture would probably work just fine certainly on the iPhone Plus in landscape mode The A processors in the latest iPhones would support these modes just as the A does Although it wasnt discussed at the conference I believe these features will be coming to the next generation of iPhones at least for the Plus size This will give iPhone a huge advantage over Android smartphones and sustain iPhones market share gains through the rest of the calendar year Likewise the rudimentary state of multitasking in Android M suggests that its deployment will significantly lag that of iOS leaving Apples next generation devices unchallenged during the crucial December quarter I look for Apples next generation iPads to pick up market share at the expense of Android tablets and finally post some yy sales gains in the December quarter How the next generation iPad especially the much rumored inch iPad Pro will fare against Windows tablets is a more difficult problem iOS multitasking closes an important gap that has existed Well almost closes since Windows will allow more than apps to be open in split screen and will even support resizable Windows How well an iPad or iPad Pro will do against Win tablets may come down to how well Apples next generation processor dubbed the A stacks up against Intels NASDAQ INTC Skylake The A will feature the Samsung OTCSSNLF nm process so it will be much more competitive in terms of energy efficiency than Apples processors have been up until now As I have pointed out elsewhere the AX achieved rough performance parity with the base Core M found in Apples MacBook with Retina Display The A will have to do much better since Skylake represents a redesign of the Broadwell microarchitecture although it will still be fabricated on Intels nm node The A being Apples first bit processor represented a significant architectural advance over its previous ARM based processors as well as a significant advance over the first generation generic bit processor designs from ARM NASDAQ ARMH itself Cortex A Apple will need a similar jump in performance to be competitive with Skylake but it has demonstrated that it is capable of such advances The competitive landscape for iPad has shifted dramatically in the past year Android tablets are no longer the threat Windows is now the real threat to iPad just as personal computing has become the real opportunity A decisive battle looms between Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in this important personal computing space The battle will be decisive because tablets and phablets are becoming the personal computers for the rest of us assuming the role that the original Mac only aspired to I wish I could say that
