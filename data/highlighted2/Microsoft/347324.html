class='textDiv'>As Apple Watch Stumbles Fitbit Steps Toward Taking More Market Share Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple Watch sales plunged after the April launch and then had a disappointing holiday Q Fitbit took back market share from Apple in Q and now Blaze is likely taking more market share away from Apple Watch Fitbit is winning wearables Apples lack of support for their flagging watch in this weeks Apple Day event will benefit Fitbit even further Apples price reduction of the watch reflects disappointing sales The Apple Watch expected in September may have limited improvements and needs to improve the very short oneday battery life Fitbit has been building an RD army of engineers developers and designers Innovation in wearables will be lead by both Fitbit and Apple in and beyond This weeks Apple NASDAQ AAPL event in Cupertino was expected to focus on the new iPhone and iPad products that drive significant revenues for the company The Apple Watch barely moves the revenues needle for the quarterly earnings reports and therefore receives proportionately less resources and attention In addition the widely accepted acknowledgement that the Watchs sales have been disappointing may have diminished the resources being allocated to the Watch since its launch almost one year ago in April So expectations were not high for the amount of upgrades resources and improvements that Apple would announce for the Watch at this event But even with the lowered expectations for the Apple Watch we were surprised that the only assistance given by Apple to this struggling product was a few more watch band choices Even just a software upgrade to improve the glaringly obvious flaw of the Apple Watchs brief oneday battery life would have been a big help But no such help was forthcoming today from Apple for the flagging Apple Watch This lack of support for the Apple Watch in the marketplace helps the wearables category pioneer and leader Fitbit NYSE FIT Fitbit continues to grow market share strengthen its firstmover advantages and grow its defensible moat that is getting stronger every day around its superior ecosystem in wearables With almost twice the market share of Apple Fitbit is the undisputed worldwide leader in wearables click to enlarge Investors should take notice that Fitbit took back market share from both Apple and Xiaomi PRIVATE XI during the important Q holiday quarter as shown in the graphic below Importantly the above graphic showing Fitbit taking market share from Apple was prior to the successful launch of Fitbits Blaze a smart fitness watch Now the acquisition of increasing amounts of market share by Fitbit from Apple has very likely accelerated since Blaze is literally selling out of stock at bigbox retail stores and also outselling the Apple Watch on Amazon NASDAQ AMZN by at least more than a ratio of The Apple Watch used to be the bestselling smartwatch on Amazon while Fitbits multiple products dominated the fitness tracker subcategory in wearables Now that Blaze has launched in the smartwatch subcategory in direct competition with the Apple Watch the Apple product has fallen from the number one spot to the number six spot on Amazons bestsellers list for smartwatches priced above Impressively at the time of this writing Blaze now occupies all topfive spaces ahead of the Watch on this Amazon list Fitbits Blaze has actually taken all five top spots on this bestsellers list and has pushed the only Apple product able to compete down to the number six spot This kind of clear market feedback from an online channel check as powerful as Amazon cannot be ignored by reasonable people and prudent investors Those who want to diminish the importance of the Amazon retail channel do so at their own expense A brief history of the Watch helps to put this products curious evolution into context The Apple Watch began accepting preorders on April and started shipping on April th The initial Watch product launch was preceded by much fanfare and hyperbole which was quickly followed by a plunge in sales The plunge in sales was followed by awful holiday sales of the Apple Watch Please reference a previous article Apple Watch Vs Fitbit Blaze The Early Winner May Surprise You for a list of reasons why the Apple Watch is struggling in the marketplace while Fitbit products are winning After the Apple Watch delivered disappointing holiday sales it was met with more bad news as the arrival of the Fitbit Blaze began to compete directly headtohead with the Apple Watch in its own smartwatch subcategory It is important to recognize that wearables are divided into two primary subcategories called fitness activity trackers and smartwatches Fitbit has dominated the fitness activity tracker subcategory for many years but had no entry into the smartwatch subcategory With the recent arrival of Blaze called a smart fitness watch it now appears that Fitbit also is dominating the smartwatch subcategory at the expense of Apples Watch It is likely that the upcoming quarterly IDC reports in will show a continuation of the Q action of Fitbit taking market share from Apple in wearables The latest event for the Apple Watchs evolution came this week as Apple announced only a few new watch bands and a price cut for the Apple Watch This surprising lack of support by Apple for the struggling Watch nearly a fullyear after the products disappointing launch speaks volumes Even if Apple had invested the resources to at least bring some kind of a software upgrade for the Apple Watch that maybe could have extended the brief oneday battery life of the Apple Watch then that would have shown some degree of commitment to the Watch But by only bringing the cosmetic effort of a few new watch bands to the table for the Watch Apple gives the appearance of being unconcerned with regard to this marginal product And the price cut from to on the Apple Watch just reflects how poorly the consumer is receiving the Watch In fact the Apple Watch retailed for only during much of the holiday sales season and it did not seem to help sales very much so the current price cut down to may not help much either But the price cut will substantially reduce both revenues and profit margins on the Watch at Apple when the company already must have been receiving a low ROI on this product even prior to the price cut The lack of resources being given to the Watch along with the price cut speak loudly about Apples plans for the future of the Watch Apple is a company struggling with decelerating growth in its core businesses and may be facing for the first time ever a decline in YOY growth for its iPhone business that recently accounted for of Apples revenues This significant problem of declining sales growth in core businesses can only detract from Apples resources applied to the Watch which barely contributes anything significant to the quarterly revenues In addition to flagging sales across the board at Apple CEO Tim Cook recently chose to selfinflict a public relations nightmare upon Apple Cook could have chosen to handle the issue of opening the San Bernardino terrorists cell phone quietly and properly Instead Cook chose to make a dramatic activist stand against the US government that can only end badly for Apple and its shareholders This level of distraction at Apple and its impact upon worldwide sales is unlikely to be positive as neither the consumer nor the US government appreciates Cooks grandstanding and lack of assistance on fighting radical Islamic terrorists Because of Cooks poor handling of this issue now the worldwide consumer is watching as Apple is now in a loselose situation Bill Gates has admitted that taking his company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to war against the US government was one of the major regrets of his career Cooks folly in choosing to bring this negative distraction upon Apple will likely make the problems with the struggling Watch pale in comparison to the much bigger fish that are now frying at Apple This may well mean even fewer resources for the Watch at Apple while Fitbit continues to stay focused like a laser beam on their core mission of continued innovation and dominance of the wearables category It is understood that Apple will often employ the oneyear upgrade cycle to successful products that merit the commitment of resources by the company It is clear that there is a lack of consumer demand for the Watch and this may have contributed to the decision to bring almost zero support for the Watch during this weeks Apple event at company headquarters Likewise the version upgrade for the Watch has been postponed to an expected SeptemberOctober release which would be about months after the original launch of the Watch Again low demand by the consumer can be a partial reason for this delay But there may be another significant reason for the lack of current support and the delay in the upgrade cycle battery life Battery life of the Watch may be one of its biggest weaknesses Because the number of apps on the original watch draw so much power the Watch must be recharged at least daily and some highuse consumers complain of far less than one day of battery power Compare this with the Fitbit products that deliver five days battery life thereby enabling valuable features like sleep tracking that are important to the consumer but not possible with the Watch The convenience factor of a fiveday battery life is also really important to the consumer Apple has missed badly on this point in a wrongminded effort to overload the Watch with far too many apps that the consumer finds useless The sales numbers between Fitbit products and the Watch speak loudly on behalf of the consumer choices with regard to issues such as battery life So Apples failure to bring improvements to the Watch at this weeks event and the delay in the product cycle upgrade may not just be due to weak consumer demand for the Watch There also may be an inability to deliver any meaningful improvements or upgrades in tech for the Watch It will be interesting to see what the excellent engineers designers and developers at Apple can deliver for the Watch expected this Autumn But we should not expect miracles since the original Watch apps have already maxed out the prerequisite battery life capacity of this device Hopefully improving the oneday battery life issue is a priority for Apple to innovate and advance If not then they will be limited in bringing any other substantial upgrades to the Watch unless they are willing to reengineer the device from the ground up and become more focused on delivering what the consumer wants The Swiss Army knife approach to smartwatches with a product that tries to do too much is not what the consumer wants Fitbit has demonstrated an accurate understanding of what the consumer wants as communicated in the graphic below Variant view Here is what caught our attention in this weeks Apple Day event in relation to the future of the Watch While Cook presented HealthKit as an app primarily for the iPhone he failed to mention this app can also be used with the Apple Watch OS Mobile health mHealth is going to become the future for each of us our employers our insurers our healthcare providers and maybe even our governments If Apple can see past the many other distractions and demands that are pressing them now and see how large the future of mHealth is going to be for all of us and future generations then Apple will commit the resources necessary to help lead and pioneer in this valuable nascent category of wearables HealthKit is an important step in that direction Apple needs more resources dedicated to the advancement of mHealthrelated apps and hardware and less resources wasted on damaging public relations debacles that embattle a publicly traded company with a more powerful entity like the US government This more businessoriented focus would serve the best interests of shareholders better while freeing up resources that enable Apple to return to its successful roots of innovation and product development Summary While these early days of wearables are beginning to make the direction of the trend toward mHealth clear the innovation by companies like Fitbit and Apple are just barely scratching the surface for what is to come The growth in this huge mHealth wearables industry will be increasingly important for Apples stock price in the years ahead but for the midcap pureplay in wearables called Fitbit the future is now The coming innovations delivered by the army of engineers designers and developers being hired by Fitbit will launch this company to a level higher than many investors are currently envisioning for Fitbit And the rapid highgrowth rate of the overall wearables category will ensure that multiple companies will be able to compete and succeed during the decades ahead for wearables At this time it looks as if Fitbit Apple and possibly Samsung will be the industry leaders of the wearables category in the future Whether other companies also can raise their level of innovation and quality of products in wearables will determine their chances for survival and advancement in this increasingly important industry of wearables and mHealth Disclosure I amwe are long FIT AAPL I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Additional disclosure I have sold half of my Apple position recently I plan to sell the remaining half of my Apple position into any strength offered by the release of the next generation iPhone I am not bullish on future growth prospects for shares of AAPL </div></body></html>
