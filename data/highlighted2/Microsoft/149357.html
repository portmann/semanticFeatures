class='textDiv'>Premarket Biotech Digest Apple In Healthcare The Apple Gilead Comparison Phase I Trials Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha This article discusses what Apple is doing in healthcare and what it can do Also compares Apples and Gileads pun alert Four phase trials reported in this period Apple NASDAQ AAPL has long dabbled in healthcare I can remember even years ago when there were talks of developing apps to help senior citizens navigate through their medication regimen Early this year Apple teamed up with IBM NYSE IBM and Japan Post Japans largest health and lifeinsurance company to deliver an iPad and a set of IBM apps to senior citizens that can help them live healthier Another development is Apples HealthKit platform which is being tried by various hospitals including Mayo Clinic to collect realtime data from iPhones and connect it to hospitals doctors and electronic medical records One potential benefit of continuous symptom tracking will be lower number of hospital and doctor visits thus trimming some of that trillion that America spends annually on its healthcare It can also enable doctors proactively advise patients demonstrating elevated symptoms through their Apple devices According to a report on Reuters by Christina Farr those trying out Apples service included at least eight of the hospitals on one list ranking the best hospitals the US News World Reports Honor RollApples HealthKit works by gathering data from sources such as glucose measurement tools food and exercisetracking apps and Wifi connected scales Apple is also allowing researchers and healthcare startups to use its HealthKit and ReserachKit platform to develop useful apps One such app developed at the MIT Media Lab is Gingerio which uses sensor data collected through the phone and selfreported information to identify people who may need help Another app developed at Stanford to study cardiovascular health had subjects enrolled overnight which as Alan Yeung medical director of Stanford Cardiovascular Health put it would take a year and medical centers around the country In yet another development Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research has codeveloped an app that had users in a few days CEO Todd Sherer says that while there are concerns about nonrepresentative data that is a concern in standard clinical trials as well Having just spent over million in a year traditional biomarker study he thinks any technology that can enhance user engagement is worthwhile especially since doing this the Apple way is so much cheaper easier and quicker It appears to me that so far Apple has concentrated its focus on healthcare data tracking and monitoring which is a great thing That can help patients doctors hospitals and insurance providers in a number of ways One related but unexplored area is clinical study enrollment where companies usually spend billions of dollars every year and which is generally a great source of trial delay Patient data usually comes from hospitals and clinics however various sorts of state and federal laws make access very difficult Apples huge network can certainly help But data monitoring while a good thing isnt science fiction Science fiction is data generation which is what the iWatch tried to do but didnt really succeed If there was an iPhonelike device which could monitor blood glucose blood pressure heart rate perform simple pathological tests simple forms of imaging and endoscopies and generate individual patient data that could be remotely monitored by a doctor that would be nextgeneration science The Apple iWatch was a very small step towards that goal a step more in what it planned to accomplish but failed rather than in what it actually did It was supposed to do a lot of things blood sugar blood glucose blood oxygen levels but it ended up as a goldencased smartwatch that tells you when to run Heres an extensive quote about what it tried but failed and may yet get done Apple began developing the watch about four years ago with a focus on health and fitness Its not unusual for Apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development but the watch was especially challenging people familiar with the matter said Internally the project became known as a black hole sucking in resources one of these people said Development languished because much of the healthsensor technology failed to meet Apples standards these people said Apple tinkered with sensors that measured the conductivity of skin a concept used in polygraphs to gauge stress The technology also showed promise for heartrate monitoring such as an electrocardiogram or EKG these people said But these features didnt perform consistently on some people including those with hairy arms or dry skin Results also varied depending on how tightly the person wore the Watch they said Instead Apple opted for more pedestrian pulserate monitoring these people said Apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or the amount of oxygen in the blood but the results were inconsistent Moreover if Apple interpreted the numbers to provide health or behavior advice the company likely would have needed approval from the US Food and Drug Administration or other regulators These features were shelved for the first version of the watch but they may be included in future models the people familiar with the matter said Focus Ticker Apple and Biotech Stocks Performance Comparison Apple has returned over the last years In the same period the NASDAQ has returned Rival technology company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQ MSFT has returned just Indeed it is very difficult to find a company the size of Apple having such stellar returns The closest any stocks that would come to Apple in terms of returns would most likely be in the biotechnology sector It must be noted that any comparison will not be ideal given that Apples market cap of billion would dwarf nearly all companies in the biotech sector For the purpose of comparison I have chosen Gilead Sciences NASDAQ GILD market cap of billion and Amgen NASDAQ AMGN market cap of billion In a way both companies are similar to Apple when it comes to creating value for shareholders In the same period that Apple shares have returned Gilead has returned Interestingly Amgen has returned just around Since the start of the millennium Apple has returned more than Amgens return of in the same period once again fall well short of Apples But Gilead has generated returns of in the same period The iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index ETF has returned since the start of the millennium The last years has seen the index return Celgene NASDAQ CELG is another large cap biotech Its performance in the last years has been impressive returning But again this is dwarfed by the returns generated by Apple Indeed when comparing to some of the best performing large cap biotechs the only stock that stands out against Apple is Gilead Sciences Mylan Lowers Acceptance Condition on Perrigo Offer Mylan NASDAQ MYL announced that it has formally lowered its acceptance condition for its bid to acquire Perrigo NYSE PRGO The acceptance condition has been lowered from not less than of Perrigo ordinary shares to greater than of Perrigo ordinary shows While MYL said that the move to lower acceptance condition showed its commitment towards completing an acquisition Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa was critical of the move Papa said that the offer from Mylan already substantially undervalues PRGO and the latest announcement makes the deal even worse Galectin Shares Rally on Patent News Galectin Therapeutics NASDAQ GALT shares rose more than on Thursday as the company announced the receipt of a Notice of Allowance from the US PTO for patent application number If issued the patent will extend coverage of GALTs pectinderived compounds to include treatment of kidney disease associated with the
