class='textDiv'>Apple Watch The Reason For Fitbits Crash Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Fitbit recently reported excellent results for its Q yet is selling off The perception of Fitbit is being affected by the success of Apple Watch Fitbit NYSE FIT closed out as the wearables leader in unit shipments but Apple NASDAQ AAPL Watch was hot on its heels Since reporting earnings on Monday Fitbits share price has dropped over The reason is simple Apple is going to do to the wearables market what it did to smartphones grab most of the industrys profit Market research firm IDC has confirmed that Apple moved into second place in unit shipments with million in the December quarter behind Fitbit with million IDC estimates cumulative unit shipments for the year at million for Fitbit and million for Apple Watch As a side note I believe IDC is a little low in their December quarter estimate for Apple As I stated in my Apple earnings review article I think the unit shipments for Apple Watch were higher at about six million units My difference with IDC is mostly about the sales profile for the last three quarters of calendar Im in agreement with IDC that total sales were about million That Apple moved so quickly and easily into second place in Q undoubtedly is one of the factors weighing on the minds of investors following Fitbits earnings release Competing wearables from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT as well as a host of Android Wear devices such as the ludicrously expensive Tag Heuer Carrera Connected didnt make the cut of IDCs top five This was despite Apple Watch having a relatively high entry level price point of for the Watch Sport The Apple Watch ASP is somewhere north of while Fitbits ASP is south of dollars Apple has already staked out its turf in the premium end of the wearables market The next step is to scoop up the profits by forcing its competitors down market This seems to be where Fitbit is inevitably headed For Fitbit achieved an admirable gross margin of on revenue of billion During its conference call Fitbits CFO William Zerella guided to more of the same for billion in revenue and gross margin of The guidance for Q was a different matter with revenue of million and gross margin of NonGAAP EPS was which will probably translate into a GAAP loss The guidance for Q is probably where things are headed for Fitbit for the rest of the year Fitbit is in effect already starting the race to the bottom and thats a slippery slope that few companies ever climb out of Even the Fitbit Blaze which represents a more direct competitor to Watch and a break with the companys usual fare of plastic fitness trackers is priced at only In the long run companies such as Fitbit may be doomed to be marginalized by the smartphone makers Fitbit can provide a companion app for their devices that run on iPhone or Android but thats not really the same thing as the level of integration that Apple provides with Apple Watch or even whats available in Android Wear The value proposition of wearables ultimately rests on this integration Once again its about the ecosystem specifically the mobile device ecosystems of iOS and Android A third party app doesnt really compete effectively with what the owners of the mobile device operating systems can achieve Apple has taken this further than anyone else to provide services to the user beyond fitness tracking or timekeeping Apple Watch supports a host of different app notifications as well as communications functions even voice recognition through being closely coupled wirelessly to iPhone The fact that Apple is also building in significant standalone capability in Watch and is likely to do more in the future just makes Apples solution all the more compelling Apples clearly articulated product strategy is to push more and more functionality into ever smaller devices Apple Watch is clearly being positioned to handle voice and video communication in future versions For some time to come this will still be mediated by a device such as the iPhone But I see the iPhone evolving into a more general purpose personal computing device that people use when they want more processing power or a larger screen size In this sense I see the iPhone and iPad eventually merging into a spectrum of devices with a range of screen sizes and always connected capability with Watch serving as an important user interface of first resort Given that this is where mobile devices are heading how much room is there for a company that only makes a wearable such as Fitbit Not much Apples product strategy with Apple Watch is something Apple bears still dont get The bears tend to focus on the fate of iPhone but dont realize that Apple already has an iPhone successor in Watch With Watch providing the most important communications functions the main function of the smartphonephablettablet is going to be to provide a larger viewing area as well as provide communications relay in the background Consumers will just choose whatever screen size device that fits their needs As advances are achieved in processors communications technology and batteries the Watch will be able to be selfsufficient in communications so that tethering to an iPhone will not be necessary This is still a few years at least in the future but Apples positioning of the Watch anticipates this future When Apple Watch comes into its own and this may take a few generations people will realize what a bold innovative step Apple Watch has been I remain long Apple and
