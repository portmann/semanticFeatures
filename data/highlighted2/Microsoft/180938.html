NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha LF Capital Management LF Capital Management clicks Although MSFT is not a growth stock with massive upside strong management and cash flows provide solid downside protection as the company puts its forwardthinking transition plan in motion The company has consistently brought in more than billion in free cash flow every year over the past five years with average FCF per year north of billion A strong dividend yield and working capital provide a safe cushion for investors as technically the stock looks ready to rise on any good news Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT have traded sideways for a year now with spikes offsetting subsequent dips We believe the result is an attractively valued stock with a great dividend yield excellent management and a forwardthinking transition plan in motion that has already yielded strong results in its early stages Overall we feel that while MSFT is not a growth stock that will create plus upside for investors we do believe MSFT is a relatively riskfree investment sitting on and producing lots of cash annually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>currently has a net current asset value or NCAV or billion On the most recent July share count of billion this equates to roughly in NCAV At a market quote of this means MSFT is trading at x NCAV When actually interpreting this multiple we believe it is extremely favorable for a cashgenerating company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>We like to think of the fair value of a company as the net present value of all future free cash flows plus NCAV So from this standpoint we believe the market is valuing the net present value of all future free cash flows at billion current market capitalization of billion less NCAV of billion From our standpoint if the net present value of all future free cash flows is substantially greater than this billion the stock is a good long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has long been known as a cash cow The company has raked in more than billion in free cash flow every year over the past five years with the trailing fiveyear average FCF per year being billion The company has generated billion of FCF over the past five years which is roughly of the required NPV FCF of billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is certainly a business in transition and its unfair to extrapolate historical performance to judge the future performance of a business in transition but we do believe these historical cash flow figures hold merit when considering the valuation When talking about the future of the operating business we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is taking the right steps to ensure continued strong revenue earnings and cash flow growth Perhaps the smallest area the company is making big moves in is with its Xbox gaming console and we believe the company is set to have Xbox sales undergo healthy growth this holiday season Total Xbox revenue was up with platform revenue up driven by volume growth from million to million We believe the Xbox platform is continuing to distinguish itself from the Playstation platform Xbox is surging in popularity and the backwards compatibility adds a huge bonus for the Xbox One over the PS This holiday season Xbox platform sales should surge with an impressive suite of games being released including the new Halo Call of Duty and Star Wars Battlefront installments Retailers such as GameStop NYSE GME are offering these games bundled with Xbox One and PS systems and we believe these bundle offerings will create an uptick in the upgrade cycle for these newgen gaming platforms This is the strongest lineup set to release for the new consoles yet and will finally give reason for many of the older gen users to make the transition Moreover Xbox Live sales grew MRFY with hardware sales and this is a good sign of growing ARR something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is focused on In the video game market many analysts believe the traditional box hardware video gaming market has peaked and that box gaming has ceded and will continue to cede market share to mobile and tablet gaming It appears <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is positioning itself and its Xbox platform for this jump attempting to possibly integrate its current gaming infrastructure with the Surface Regardless of where the gaming market heads hardware consoles or mobiletablet gaming we believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is aptly positioned to profit from the gaming market This precludes a discussion of the Surface and the success that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>seems positioned to reap Surface sales grew YoY starkly contrasting to Apples continued weak iPad performance The growing demand for ins and increased spending in the IoT Internet of Things market promises that demand for the tablet will remain high Seamless integration with Windows only bolsters the attractiveness and utility of the Surface and we believe current trends indicate demand for the Surface will increase It should be noted here that Windows adoption has been extremely high further evidence of Microsofts continually strengthening and expanding ecosystem Microsofts commercial cloud business is booming on multiple fronts with commercial cloud ARR growing in constant currency to billion Office subs base grew million MRQ to million by quarters end While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Azure still significantly lags AWS it has plenty of growth ahead of it given brand name affiliation in a hugely growing market We also believe that despite the dying commercial licensing business ramped up Office adoption will continue and is indicative of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>being able to replace and even exceed lost software revenue almost wholly According to Bitglass Office adoption has more than tripled in the past year rising to of enterprises Office is now the most widely used business cloud application of any type We fully expected this as we believe that Microsofts former share of the business productivity software market naturally implies a huge share of the SaaS business productivity market As customers ditch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>software its a natural and convenient step to transition to Office On the search engine side Bing grew market share to MRQ and looks to be profitable this year a footnote in Microsofts strengthening and expanding ecosystem There are several moving parts that comprise the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>machine and we believe many of these moving parts are operating fluidly and look nicely positioned to generate higher ARR and profit margins in the near future All things considered we believe the current market value is underwhelming relative to Microsofts potential future cash flows A dividend yield and billion in working capital provide a nice cushion for investors and we believe the stock is technically positioned to rise on any good news If the company can generate somewhere near its fiveyear trailing average FCF of billion per year the stock is undervalued here Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may
