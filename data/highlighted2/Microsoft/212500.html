Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics AMD will collect M and maintains a portion of the JV On October Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD announced the signing of a definitive agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics NFME to form a Joint Venture JV to provide enhanced SATS Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services utilizing AMDs current ATMP Assembly Test Mark and Pack facilities in Malaysia and China After selling their fabs to Global Foundries AMD had maintained their ATMP facilities With this transaction they are also out of the ATMP side of the semiconductor business and that should minimize CAPEX going forward The value of the transaction is M with net to AMD after expenses at about M Closing is expected in the first half of Cash balance and cash flow should both improve in The M in cash should put AMDs cash balance at about B from the current M about the same as the year ending balance for the last years b B and B for and respectively This should provide them with more than enough time to bring Zen to market in late Commercial volumes should then ramp up in providing a significant boost to sales and profits Even if the quarterly negative Cash Flow of M continues each quarter for the next year the cash balance as of Q would be higher than it is right now The ATMP facilities are capital intensive so CAPEX relative to the ATMP facilities should be decreased According to CFO Kumar CAPEX should be down a total M in per transcript Also the transferring of employees about of AMD employees to NFME will decrease operating costs significantly CFO Kumar mentions M in OPEX savings not including JV savings which are yet to be determined So total savings on CAPEX and OPEX including the new JV will certainly be well over M in The agreement also calls for no overall cost increase for AMDs use of the JVs ATMP services Also the M inventory writedown should provide some cash in the next quarter or two as the lower cost inventory is sold off We dont know what the original value of the inventory written down was but if the original cost was written down the sale of all reduced inventory at cost would be about M That would of course not be profit but it would more than offset the current quarters M negative cash flow So we have M in CAPEX and OPEX savings in plus additional OPEX savings once the JV is finalized plus positive cash generation from selling the written down inventory So cash cash and more cash for This bodes well for AMD going forward New product introductions should help sales New graphics products including the Radeon R Nano and the Embedded RSeries SOC seem to have stemmed the tide of market share losses to Intel NASDAQ INTC and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA but the PC and tablets graphics market as a whole is down in meaning graphic chip sales are down too But according to Gartner PC and tablet sales should increase modestly in and The newest Carrizo chip is going after the largest segment of the laptop market the to price range While this could help sales marginally I dont think it will be a blockbuster product However even a modest improvement would help until Zen comes along In some ways sales this quarter were better than they looked If you compare Q vs Q sales are up M vs B If you go back to Q vs Q the sales actually went down a small amount B vs B Of course YoY comparisons were down by but that was less than last quarters YoY down But the question to ask is was Q the low point for sales Time will tell Next years sales comparisons will be much easier and may bring some surprises In addition to the new GPUs and APUs game consoles sales should continue to increase and the previously announced semicustom SOC contracts should provide some increase in sales Is a buyout possible Rumors continue to fly that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT may be interested in AMD As a member of the x duopoly it only makes sense that weak AMD is on the buyout radar And the termination of the cross licensing deal with Intel is actually an advantage to AMD because if an agreement is not reached with the new acquirer license fees will have to be paid back and forth with both parties And since Intel has times the sales of AMD their license fee income would be multiples of Intels So a new license deal will be reached in case of AMDs acquisition because Intel cannot function without AMDs IP for example AMDs bit extension The cross licensing deal is explained here I would think any acquirer would do so within the next months before Zen production starts After that the price would certainly go up significantly What could possibly go wrong Well lots of things of course The first and most important is the closing of the new JV deal which will provide all the cash needed to see Zen come to fruition If something happens to terminate or delay the closing cash may be a problem in And cash is all important to AMD as I discussed in AMD Reasons Why Cash Is Much More Important Than Jim Kellers Departure Secondly any delay of Zen production would also have a big negative effect on the stock although with the extra cash from the JV a delay would not be terminal but would be a significant setback Thirdly if sales do not increase in then cash flow may be a problem since further cuts in CAPEX and OPEX will be difficult to come by And fourthly any lack of focus on getting saleable products out the door will be hugely problematic But so far at least I am impressed with CEO Lisa Sus management of this especially important aspect of AMDs business prospects I have been intrigued by AMD for a long time One of my first articles on SA was about AMDs prospects over the next few years Reasons Why AMD Will Be By where I outlined my arguments for a big increase in price by Do I think they can still be at by Yes I do although admittedly I would say by the end of not the beginning One could easily argue that AMD has been the worst managed semiconductor company over the last years or so But those are exactly the kind of companies that can provide significant capital gains over the medium term If Zen is on time and Lisa Su can keep the company focused and disciplined for the next two years the price of the stock will go up significantly If not then I think they will be sold piecemeal Graphics X IP with little left for shareholders after the debt is paid So looking at it as a binary outcome is probably best One way to play this with some risk capital is to buy LEAPS at or above That may generate massive profits and if not then the loss will not be much greater
