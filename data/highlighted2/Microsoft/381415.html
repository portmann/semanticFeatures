class='textDiv'>The Fair Value Of Apple Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha We use our proprietary valuation models to value Apples stock price We find that Apple is fairly to undervalued The purpose of our article to use valuation techniques to value Apple NASDAQ AAPL Apple is an unique valuation case because Apples PE ratio is well below the SP s PE In addition Apples dividend yield is around which is greater than the rate from a ten year Treasury note From this analysis alone it appears as if Apple is a great investment We assume an investor would rather invest in Apple and earn over the next years rather than the US government at a similar rate However we need to get deeper to understand whether the current valuation of per share is grossly undervalued or appropriate We start with our assumptions that go into both the DCF and comparables model Our main assumptions for the discounted cash flow are in regard to the projected financials We assume that the operating expense to revenue ratio is which is the historical average We project the balance sheet out by assuming that the asset to revenue and liability to revenue ratio for the projected years is the same as the year In regard to the comparables use Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM and Sony NYSE SNE as comparable companies The cost of capital is determined using a CAPM model with a size and firmspecific risk premium to calculate the cost of equity and a proprietary credit model to calculate the cost of debt Our credit rating for Apple is AA The levered beta is Putting this together we arrive at a cost of capital of One of the most important assumptions is the revenue growth rate Over the past four years Apples growth rate has been variable reaching a high of in and a low of in Figure Apples Revenue Growth Rate For the DCF lets assume the revenue growth rate for the projection period is an average of the last three years This results in an average revenue growth of per year Then assume in perpetuity revenue will grow at the rate In the comparables model we back out an implied expected ten year growth rate from the comparable companys stock price and financials The growth rate calculated is We use the number in our comparables analysis The stock price calculated is very similar to the actual stock price trading on April of In addition we find that both methods result in a similar value Therefore our results indicate that the market is currently valuing Apple around its fair value Next we look at different growth rate scenarios We keep everything the same for both the DCF and comparables but change our growth rate assumption Table displays the different revenue growth rate scenarios These growth rates are for the projection period and terminal value calculation We can see that when revenue growth hits or more the valuation of Apple can increase dramatically Is it possible for Apple to increase revenue further We believe it is Since the iPhone has been launched in revenue growth has averaged slightly over If we assume Apples longterm growth rate will be one third of its growth rate since Apples stock price is undervalued Table DCF Revenue Growth Scenarios Let us assume Apple earns a revenue growth rate for the next five years and then in perpetuity earns a modest growth rate In this scenario we obtain a per share stock price If we assume Apple earns a revenue growth rate for five years and then in perpetuity we obtain a per share stock price The tax rate is important We do not really know what their actual tax rate is If the tax rate is as low as a longterm revenue growth rate yields a per share stock price Also a revenue growth for next five years and a perpetuity growth rate the inflation rate yields an per share stock price That is upside versus downside We are willing to bet that Apples revenue growth rate will be greater than in perpetuity Apple has the ecosystem and following to create additional revenue through services In addition there is a lot of room to grow globally Countries such as India and Russia are untapped markets Now assume as many critics do that Apple will become mature to the point where it has not real growth Many dominant companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reach a point where no more growth is possible If this occurs sooner rather than later then we need to look at different perpetuity growth rates Let us assume that Apples revenue growth starts at for and declines by per year until and then Apple grows at the expected inflation rate Therefore Apple grows for five more years and then becomes a no real growth company The stock price in this scenario with a tax rate is Essentially the stock price at which Apple is trading at as of April Assuming a more realistic tax rate the market is expecting Apple to become a nogrowth company in the next five years If we use the same growth rates but the stated effective tax rate the stock price value we calculate is The bad case scenario yields a negative return We believe the probability of a bad case scenario is small As of today Apples stock price is trading at very modest growth expectations The market does not believe Apple will create amazing growth for the future If Apple can slightly exceed modest growth expectations we believe the stock price can increase in the following year from beating those expectations The probability of modest growth or slightly beating expectations is much greater than any other scenario Therefore we agree that Apple stock is a good buy at the current price I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha
