NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article MSFT is a dominant and therefore attractive tech giant for longterm investors With strong cash flows and bold moves to leverage its dominance to grow in new segments it looks set for an equally healthy future MSFT passes most of my FCF tests However it is currently running well ahead of my FCF fair value of around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is a familiar name to most of us I for one am so immersed in its various products I would struggle to separate myself from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for a single day without causing myself some serious issues personally and professionally From Windows to Office and the xBox to the Surface <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is wellembedded and increasingly embedding itself in our software and hardware lives As a consumer therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is everywhere Indeed its consumer revenues are generously spread across these diverse and attractive areas as the Annual Report highlights But actually the side of the business which faces the consumer directly amounts to less than half of Microsofts revenues Although a vast majority of this commercial revenue comes from licensing software to businesses a growing proportion is coming from its Azure cloud services and other attractive areas falling under the other segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is therefore a highly attractive business Its licensing business benefits from a strong economic moat with things such as Office and Windows so embedded in our work and private lives it will take some time and a lot of effort to displace it It has made some very interesting moves Shifting its main software packages from oneoff big purchases to a subscription model is interesting and from a cash flow perspective very attractive indeed in the report they noted subscriptions for Office grew million over the year to million Whats more its moves into mobile and the Surface tabletlaptop hardware are fascinating These and other moves leverage the power of their brand and core products well Nonetheless despite this clear strength does it pass my five free cash flow tests These tests I use in the first stage in my analysis of a company Most recently this has included coffee giant Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX and apparel makers V F Corp NYSE VFC and Nike NYSE NKE Using them provides a detailed although far from exhaustive breakdown of the financial health of the company Its solvency Its efficiency Its value Cash is king and these tests look to set the ability of the business to produce free cash flow against its debt dividends and more besides I use these as a screen to find businesses for a more wideranging analysis later which steps beyond the cash flow statement Our first test is simple Has the company reported positive free cash flow for each of the last five years FCF here is defined simply as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has managed to pull in pretty significant amounts of cash each year since Certainly FCF has shrunk at a rate of about each year This was largely due to OCF barely growing over that period while capex has grown at a rate of about per year This is not expected to reverse anytime soon Within the Annual Report the company wrote that We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy Therefore with revenues expected to be fairly flat and CapEx expected to grow we should not expect FCF to gallop too much higher in the near term Nonetheless with such mighty FCF figures already in place <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>starts off with a sold PASS here CROIC Cash Return on Invested Capital Next is the matter of the CROIC or cash return on invested capital Rather like the more familiar ROIC this measures the efficiency of the company in generating cash Its calculated by taking the FCF and dividing it by the sum of the debt and equity of the business My target is a CROIC of This would mean that for every of capital invested in the company they return at least in cash which is a highly attractive return So how does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>do Well like many technology companies it produces its FCF pretty efficiently Indeed over the last five years it has averaged a CROIC of However it has seen this drop dramatically in recent years This has been fed by a massive growth in debt over the period an annualized rate of as well as a smaller but still significant growth in equity annualized rate of which has not been matched by comparable growth in FCF as noted above Nonetheless even with these CROIC headwinds a CROIC well nicely above set it ahead of my target of As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>earns a PASS on this test As noted above in recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has seen its debt grow significantly From just under billion in it has marched upward to just billion in Combined with the slower growth in equity this has predictably resulted in its debt to equity ratio growing significantly Nonetheless at under its still only moderately leveraged Whats more it is not the debt to equity ratio that concerns me here but rather the FCF to debt ratio What I look for is a FCF to debt ratio of at least What this means in theory is that the company could repay the entirety of its debt in four years or less In Microsofts case things still look good despite growing debt levels and flat FCF growth Indeed with a FCF to debt ratio still sitting at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could in theory repay the entirety of its debt in a little over a year using only its FCF Very impressive Indeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is one of only a handful of companies with a credit rating in the prime AAA grade Judging from the above it is quite deserved Next is the matter of the allimportant dividend yield What particularly concerns me here is the matter of the FCF yield This is the theoretical yield if the company decided to pay out all of its FCF as a dividend What I look for is a FCF yield of or more I also look for a FCF payout ratio on the current dividend yield of or less So how does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>do here Again very well indeed Its FCF yield is over easily past my target Whats more it currently only pays out of its FCF as a dividend leaving plenty of room to grow it Theres a hefty margin of safety baked into this in light of the likely pressure on FCF growth in the near future My final test is related to its valuation when compared to its historic price Here I use the enterprise value to FCF ratio If the company is trading around or below its FCF fair value I consider it as having passed this test So how does it do Well over the last five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has seen its EVFCF valuation grow significantly This is in line with both a growing value premium and growing enterprise value that is the market cap plus debt and minus cash This means that over the last five years the average EVFCF value for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been I use this value to multiply the average of the FCF from the last financial year and that predicted for the next two years I calculate the predicted FCF per share by taking the predicted revenues for both years and multiplying this by the average taken from two FCFrevenues figures The FCFrevenues for the last financial year This gives us an average of Using this alongside the predicted revenue figures for the next two years and plugging them into my FCF fair value formula above gives us a FCF fair value of This suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is currently trading a little over ahead of its FCF fair value Unfortunately this means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>earns itself its first FAIL here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is clearly a very attractive business It sailed passed all but the valuation test Its economic moat is very wide indeed and its moves to leverage its dominance in many facets of our technological universe will I think pay off generously over the long term Nonetheless with FCF not looking set to grow for a little while and likely to shrink modestly I do find its current valuation a little rich A fair value of around would be a just reflection of both its quality and its challenges Whats more it was only a few months ago that it was trading around these levels We may therefore find that it tests these levels again in the future It is certainly on my watch list I will just have to be patient
