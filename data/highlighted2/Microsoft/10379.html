class='textDiv'>The Fault In Apples Star Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple might have to kill its iAd platform or go allin and be as intense as Google when it comes to mobile advertising A focus on mobile advertising might be more viable than online TV subscriptions The lucrative hardware focus of Apple cannot last forever I am very happy with Apple NASDAQ AAPL owning more than of operating profits on smartphones However we should not forget that the overall mobile industry is not limited to selling hardware Apples growth prospects could be better if it starts focusing on mobile advertising The chart below highlights just how profitable Apples hardwarefocused business is However I have made it very clear that Apple has an Achilles heel in iAd While Apple enjoys massive profitability with its iOS devices it continues to let rival Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebook NASDAQ FB rake in billions of dollars from delivering ads to iPhone and iPad users Since Apple cannot ban Google and Facebooks apps from monetizing iPhone and iPad users the longterm scenario is that Apple will remain a nonfactor in mobile advertising Marketing research firm eMarketers chart below shows Apples iAd platform is still a failure more than four years after the late Steve Jobs launched it My point is that Apple has zero percent market share in global mobile advertising sales in spite it having a share in global shipments of smartphones Other Firms Are Mining The Advertising Cash Cow in iOS Making massive profits in hardware should not blind Apple to the fact that other companies are riding on the success of the iOS ecosystem Apple shareholders are not getting the best return on their money because the supposedly walledin ecosystem of Apple is not closed at all when it comes to mobile advertising Thirdparty advertisers andor ad providers like Facebook could milk iPhone users through appinstall adverts Advertisers firmly believe that iPhone users are more valuable than their Android counterparts Google and Facebook can therefore charge advertisers higher fees to deliver ads to iOS users than what they charge on Android App developers love advertising on iOS Facebook apps because iPhone users are more likely to click and install the advertised apps A Majority of iPhone users belong to higher economic classes and can afford Apples highmargin pricing Consequently while Apple takes in a commission on app purchases I speculate that Apple doesnt get a share from Facebookdelivered ads Mobile advertising is a continuing missed opportunity for Apple Apple is better off improving its iAd platform rather than engaging in paid TV subscriptions Mobile advertising is already a billion industry this year and it will grow to billion by Even Tim Cooks decision to lower the Apple TVs price to will still not be enough to match the already existing number of iPhone users Even if Cook recruits more content providers like HBO the Apple TV is also unlikely to match the annual sales volume of the iPhone Unlike the hefty multibillion opportunity in mobile advertising the Apple TV concept is limited Apple has sold million iPhones but only million Apple TVs Apples TV is also no longer the number one smart TV in the US Roku and Googles Chromecast are outselling the Apple TV in America Statista predicts that there will be more than million units of connected TV sets in the world by However the global online TVVideo industry will only be worth billion by year less than half of mobile advertisings numbers Apple TV has little chance of even getting of the predicted subscription TV revenue of billion Roku Xiaomi Google and even Intel NASDAQ INTC has cheap smart TV products that will make it hard for the Apple TV to improve on its million unit sales in Apple already failed in iAd on the iPhone and iPad so the billion in online TV ads is also a nogo for Apple I continue to reiterate my Buy rating for Apple However the fault in Apples star might be that it cannot avoid its fate as a loser in mobile advertising Worse the fault in iAds star is that Apple will either have to give away all user data to advertisers or let the iAd platform die The success of Google and Facebook is due to their willingness to share comprehensive user data to thirdparty advertisers Tim Cook has repeatedly lowered the fees in iAd but advertisers still shun it because of Cooks hardline stance against data mining and data sharing Cook allowed programmatic ads on iAds last year Programmatic advertising is now also available on iTunes Radio However programmatic advertising or automated realtime bidding for ad placements is only truly effective if advertisers and ad providers get as much data as possible from targeted users Google became the king in digital and mobile advertising because there is no limit to its information gathering on people The programmatic ad services over iTunes Radio only allows advertisers to tailor their ads according to a target users email address and phone number Pandoras NYSE P advertising platform allows marketers to deliver ads based on age gender location ZIP code band affinity and musical taste Cooks dilemma now is that if he allows Apple to share complete data of the million iTunes users he risks alienating the people who paid a lot of money to own the iPhone because they like the privacy settings of iOS However quitting or limiting its involvement in the mobile advertising business in favor of preserving the loyalty of privacyfreak iPhones users might also endanger Apples longterm growth The future of the mobile industry is increasingly becoming more about winning the most number of users not about getting the most hardware profits While Apple can continue to enjoy its niche in highpriced smartphones the longterm scenario is that other smartphone vendors will eventually force Apple to also lower its iPhones average selling price The racetothebottom trend among Android smartphone manufacturers is now exacerbated by Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT aggressive push for Lumia Windows phones MSFT CEO Satya Nadella no longer prioritizes hardware The mighty resources of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are now focused on getting the most amount of mobile users for its new freemium strategy Another fault in Apples star therefore is that it cannot avoid a future where it can no longer enforce a operating margin on every new iPhone This decline in average selling price has already happened with the iPad As the racetothebottom pricing intensifies among Android and Windows phone vendors Apples iPhone pricing will also get lower Otherwise the disparity between an iPhone and Android phone will just grow too big for consumers to ignore Android phone vendors like Asus OTCASUUY and Xiaomi can already come up with a highend sub Android phones with the same or better hardware specs than a iPhone After implementing the bigger displays of the iPhone Apple has no other compelling excuse to increase the average selling prices of its next iPhones The pressure from Xiaomi and Asus will force Samsung OTCSSNLF to also lower the prices of its flagship Galaxy phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now focused on entrylevel phones but after it releases Windows this summer it might also start releasing highend
