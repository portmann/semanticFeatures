class='textDiv'>IBM The Weakest Stock Out Of Buffetts Big International Business Machines Corporation NYSEIBM Seeking Alpha IBM should be removed from Berkshires big four as the company doesnt have a durable competitive advantage in IT The broader market is rewarding growth stocks that trade at reasonable market multiples which is where investors should be concentrating their portfolio allocations IBMs capital allocation is questionable as the company has continued to demonstrate that its not forwardlooking with its investment dollars IBM could become a value trap as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Amazon are poaching IT customers from more traditional IT providers at an accelerated pace Im bearish on IBMs business model while bullish on the valuation leading to a price target and a hold rating For the most part I agree with what Warren Buffett preaches about investing His focus on value and high quality businesses is treated like religion among private equity guys and is shrugged off by the average mutual fund manager mutual fund managers tend to optimize the portfolio for risks and probabilities over valuation I dont imagine myself a pseudo Buffett wannabe because quite frankly my approach couldnt be more different with what he preaches about value investing I believe heavily in investing into growth businesses despite a pricier valuation In some cases freelunch opportunities exist but theres an attached caveat to many of them which many refer to as special situations My point of contention is with one of Buffetts more notable stock investments that belong in what he terms the big four The big four are inclusive of American Express NYSE AXP Wells Fargo NYSE WFC CocaCola NYSE KO and IBM NYSE IBM Now anyone with a long enough of an investment track record knows that not every investment pans out I made a mistake is a pretty common theme in the investment world John Pierpont Morgan lost chunks of cash on Edison Electric as competition from Westinghouse power stations proved DC to be inferior to AC George Soros lost chunks of cash in the dot com bust prompting him to change his investment strategy and Peter Lynch had years of under performance back when he was a Fidelity asset manager Black Monday circa Goldman analysts and traders blow it in the equities mortgage commodities foreign exchange and fixed income markets all the time While the average analyst and professional manager are able to infer the qualities of a business and make rational decisions on anticipated outcomes invariably they will lose some money by making bad decisions at some point in their respective careers When looking at the peer group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT exhibited the highest rate of sales growth in the trailing fiveyear period and also was able to outperform among pureplay IT providers IBM reported declining revenue in a period where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grew by These trends have supported Microsofts outperformance against other blue chip tech names and is why I continue to reiterate my buy rating on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in other articles Capital flows into the equity markets have been good Treasuries yield negative real returns which reduce the viability of bonds in comparison to stocks In an environment like this blue chip stocks have outperformed as the appetite for risk seems concentrated in low beta high market cap names US largecap growth stocks have outperformed every other asset category in the trailingtwelvemonth period This indicates that investors are searching for stocks that grow at a reasonable price versus contrarian plays that rely on a quick turn around in the underlying fundamentals As you can already tell large cap growth has outperformed large cap value by a factor of three since the inception of the year Stocks like IBM should be moving higher on technical factors but because the market anticipates a decline in the business fundamentals the valuation has shrunk as various sellside analysts have modeled negative sales growth in the current and next fiscal year To address these issues management has resorted to cost discipline as a means to improving operating performance This is a decent response to falling revenues but the dropoff in revenues shouldnt have happened in the first place which is why managers and analysts should continue to question the potential returns from investing into the company Typically you pay for what you get and while there are few exceptions to the rule The rule seems to apply here Low quality businesses attach a lower multiple because a premium is contingent on nonquantifiable factors that are more instinctual in nature Anyone who had invested in Amazon NASDAQ AMZN over the past years would have outperformed whereas anyone invested in IBM would not have outperformed the market Either everyone is acting irrationally or everyone is being extremely rational IBM has further room to drop when based on the recent commentary from the JPMorgan Technology Conference I also think that there is a lot of confusion over revenue pools versus profit pools And revenue is one of the easiest things to find in the tech industry and profit is one of the hardest And so you see a lot of interesting dynamics Now you know if you are one of those companies that is given extraordinary market valuations without necessarily having to deliver profit I suppose I am not part of one of those companies but if I was I am sure I would be sitting there smiling I am just going to plow back plow back plow back and maybe the day will come when the investors will demand that I deliver a different type of business model but in the shortterm if you let me I will just keep plowing back Steve Mills EVP of Software and Systems In the past five years IBM has had an awful tendency of competing in highly competitive markets Instead of competing in nascent revenue pools where the market size is small and potential to dominate is large the company tends to wait until the business opportunity exceeds a billion dollars Whats strange is that the management team pats itself on the back for not investing capital in nascent business opportunities where the projected return on invested capital isnt as clear IBM throws its resources into arenas where competitors have established an early lead For obvious reasons I doubt IBM will gain back some of the enterprise customers it has lost to Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Amazon was one of the first IaaS providers and quite frankly the nascent opportunity won support from the CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos himself in the earlier stages The same could be said for Azure over at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which resulted in Microsofts overwhelming capabilities in private cloud platform cloud and infrastructure cloud Clearly ramping revenue came first and then profitability came second It also earned Satya Nadella his promotion to CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as he has positioned the commercial side of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>for longterm success IBMs management team is more focused on the daytoday metrics and functionality of the business which leads to shortterm investments and shortsighted divestitures You cant attach a market premium to a business thats run like that because the management team will be reactionary to its business environment and wont establish a business in categories that have yet to be developed into profitable pools Eventually IBM will take interest when everyone else is already moving onto the next big thing in technology IBM provides infrastructure to various firms and various companies may not want to move away from IBMbranded middleware and cloud services But if IBM is going to operate like that we might as well label the company a niche operator of IT services because thats what it is becoming IBMs various software and services are now integrated into other ecosystems This has diminished its durable competitive advantage because if IBM software and services can be sold to AWS and Azure customers customers might as well move their hybrid cloud and public cloud to Amazon or various other IT services firms and buy the software from IBM This reduces the revenue that IBM can realistically anticipate from each IT customer as crosssell opportunities will diminish Needless to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been able to increase its profitability and revenue in commercial cloud Poaching customers from IBM and various other IT providers has been a cakewalk The new stalwart in IT Services will be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Amazon based on the growth trajectory as being a platform provider tends to both differentiate and solidify a competitive advantage over time IBM could prove to be a value trap as it is not positioned to thrive in a changing technology environment where commoditization of hardware and software will diminish the moat in which IBM has built its hardware and software model around Largescale data analytics can be run through Excel so as long as theres enough computing power available Not to mention various software services from IBM have proven redundant in comparison to the Windows Office Suite Warren Buffetts investment track record is unquestionably good I believe that this specific stock out of Buffetts big four will continue to underperform and investment into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would be forwardlooking without the aggressive overvaluation that leads Berkshire to steer clear from tech names in general At present I have a price target of PE which implies that the stock could exhibit some modest appreciation for but outsized gains are extremely unlikely In Wall Street lingo Im initiating a hold rating ie market perform as there are more compelling investment opportunities
