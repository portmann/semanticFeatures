Seeking Alpha Although HoloLens is still in development the technology behind it is very impressive and has great potential To be widely adopted HoloLens must overcome technical limitations that have been observed in the early prototypes by the media If these limitations can be overcome <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>may have achieved a quantum leap in computer interfaces akin to the mouse and touchscreen Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT HoloLens is the most technically innovative wearable tech introduced this year Secrecy surrounding the device and its limited exposure to the media make it challenging to assess its market potential The market potential could be huge but this is contingent on further technical advances In this article I give my initial assessment of the technical issues and promise of HoloLens Microsofts augmented reality goggles HoloLens featured prominently in the October hardware event A mixed reality game called Project Xray was demonstrated that looked like a lot of fun at least as seen in the video As an electrooptical engineer by training I continue to be blown away by the technical daring of HoloLens Im so impressed that I can even forgive Microsofts misuse of the term hologram The virtual stereoscopic objects seen through the goggles are not true holograms But the usage of the term does accord with the popular conception of holograms that goes back to Princess Leias emergency message projected by RD Other writers have not been so kind Daniel Eran Dilger dismissed HoloLens as derivative and deceptive in what has become all too familiar Apple NASDAQ AAPL fan parochialism Despite being an Apple investor and frequent writer on Apple topics I cant do the same As an engineer I have to acknowledge technical excellence whatever the source But as Ive pointed out so many times mere technical innovation does not guarantee success in the marketplace HoloLens poses considerable difficulties in trying to assess its market potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has not been very forthcoming about the technology behind HoloLens and there are no publicly available units for a teardown Im not even sure how it works although the Wikipedia writeup is probably a good summary as far as it goes However one aspect of the HoloLens has received considerable media attention since journalists were first allowed to try the system out and that is the narrow field of view of the system What this means for the user is that with the goggles the user has a sort of tunnel vision for the holograms If the user isnt looking more or less directly at the hologram it will tend to disappear The goggles are transparent so the user has the normal field of view for the real world and therefore normal peripheral vision The fact that the goggles offer no peripheral vision for holograms makes the experience very unrealistic and nonimmersive This has been pointed out in various media outlets and perhaps the best discussion of this is in Ars Technica I bring up the issue of field of view because I consider it absolutely critical to the question of the broad market appeal of HoloLens Field of view is what is going to make or break HoloLens If HoloLens can achieve the field of view of typical virtual reality goggles about degrees horizontally then it stands a very good chance of gaining wide adoption as a display medium for a wide variety of computingrelated applications gaming not the least Without the wider field of view the applications for HoloLens become much more limited and so does the market This has not been lost on the tech media which has pointed out the somewhat deceptive nature of the video demonstrations that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has put on with HoloLens as in this write up in the Verge of the October demo Writers have pointed out that what is shown in the way of hologram visibility over a much larger field of view than the HoloLens system has is not what the HoloLens user can actually see After studying the Verge video clip of the demo Ive come to the conclusion that the special HoloLens camera used to capture the action must have a much larger field of view than the prototype HoloLens itself I estimate the camera field of view to be about degrees horizontal based on the location of the camera relative to the HoloLens user and other elements of the set in the demonstration Unless the demonstration is a total fake which is not inconceivable then this means that the camera system demonstrates that the field of view limitation in the current HoloLens system can be overcome There might be limitations in packaging such as system but these limitations can probably be overcome in future iterations of HoloLens If the field of view limitation really can be overcome and thats still a big if then I believe the market potential for HoloLens becomes huge For one thing it basically takes over virtual reality since external light can be easily blocked out with a different visor So HoloLens becomes a dual mode virtualaugmented reality device But its also a better VR device by virtue of being lighter more comfortable to wear and not needing to be tethered to a PC In augmented reality mode the Project Xray game that was demoed only scratches the surface Imagine something like this as a multiplayer game with virtual costumes and weapons Its laser tag taken to a whole new level And under the right circumstances players wouldnt even need to be in the same physical location The MMO also gets taken to a whole new level With sufficient resolution and processing power HoloLens could be a platform for a new type of virtual surround video entertainment Imagine a movie where youre in the movie There are also plenty of serious applications of course such as virtual video conferencing and any number of engineering and scientific applications where HoloLens would be a useful instructional and visualization tool But its the broader entertainment applications both interactive and noninteractive that really make the market for HoloLens The market for augmented and virtual reality has been estimated to be billion by With HoloLens technology that becomes a converged market The HoloLens technical approach is so superior in my view that it represents a quantum leap compared to anything that has come before by way of virtual reality goggles The VR market is already being disrupted before even becoming a market The technical approach of putting a heavy LCD screen into a heavy set of goggles that blinds the user is already DOA Facebook NASDAQ FB and Sony NYSE SNE might as well start over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has jumped so far out in front of its competition that its hard to imagine that it will not own the ARVR market for the next five years or more Five years is the lead time that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has amassed by virtue of starting on HoloLens back in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has done nothing less than invent a fundamentally new way for humans and computers to interact This is as revolutionary as the mouse or the touchscreen This is virtual D rooms rather than virtual desktops The transition to ubiquitous use of HoloLens type systems may happen slowly At the first developer systems are not cheap Theyre also still clumsy and bulky too bulky probably for most people to want to wear for day to day use But assuming that field of view can be improved and bulk reduced it appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has this market to itself That makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a longterm buy for
