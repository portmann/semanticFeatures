class='textDiv'>Using Apples Strong Value Retention To Analyze Its Stock Price Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple trades at a significant discount to other leading consumer brands despite a history of having better economics Apples margins appear sustainable based on the superior value retention of its products In order to justify Apples stock price both margins and revenues must contract Apples NASDAQ AAPL economic success places the company amongst some of the best consumer brands in the world in terms of return on invested capital and revenue growth The companies who own these consumer brands are often thought of as having an enduring competitive advantage This advantage explains the companys high overall ROIC and revenue growth which in turn results in higher valuations However this is not the case with Apple Despite having comparable if not better numbers Apple trades at a substantial discount relative to Nike NYSE NKE Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX and CocaCola NYSE KO on the basis of earnings Despite the discrepancy described above Apples stock has enjoyed a tremendous rise Apple became the most valuable company in the world in surpassing B in value The last two companies Exxon Mobil NYSE XOM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT to approach this level were not able to sustain the momentum This implies that there are limitations to how long a company can maintain such a large value If they exist these limitations have to manifest themselves in the economics of the business Poor longterm stock performance is caused by two distinct forces Slowing revenue growth The law of large numbers comes into play An incremental dollar of sales adds more growth to the top line of a small company than a large company The larger a companys base of revenues the smaller impact a new dollar of sales has on a percentage basis Even for the most dominating products markets get saturated requiring growth to be sourced in a less optimal way Declining Returns on Invested Capital Success attracts competition The larger the profit margin the harder companies work to get a piece of it New entrants offer competitive products at lower prices to gain market share This forces the incumbent company to either reduce pricing which depresses margins or invest aggressively As a result the discrepancy in Apples relative valuation can only be explained by an anticipated decline in either revenue growth andor in ROIC In what follows we will analyze if a decline in either one of the metrics is probable and what magnitude of decline is necessary to justify Apples share price today Slowing Revenue Growth but Steady ROIC Slowing Revenues Growth One of the easiest ways to explain Apples discount is to rely upon the law of numbers and market saturation It is inescapable that revenue growth should slow down as the smartphone market continues to mature As it stands Apple enjoys market share in the smartphone market However as of the first quarter of overall iPhone sales grew by only Overall US smartphone sales totaled M units in and is only expected to grow to M by or per year Apples past revenue growth is heavily skewed by smartphones being a new phenomenon years ago Now however the US market is mature meaning growth needs to come from other products or other less wealthy countries Return on Invested Capital Competitive dynamics can be explained by relative differences in value provided to the customer In order to force the incumbent company to change its behavior customers must be drawn by a more compelling value proposition One way to measure the ability of any company to retain and grow its customer base is to measure the overall cost of ownership of its products against its competition Fortunately there is an active resale market for smartphones As a result it is a straightforward process to calculate overall monthly depreciation rates of various phones purchase costs resale pricephones age in terms of months and to calculate the different phones useful life purchase costmonthly price decline Comparing the differences in these numbers provides a quantitative measure of relative value Below is an analysis of completed used highend phones sales with similar features during March and February of The analysis is broken down into two tables showing phones that are months and older and phones that are newer than months This data reveals that iPhone enjoys a significant advantage in useful life months vs an average of months The value of the extended life can be quantified in terms of the competitor phones by multiplying their depreciation rates by the difference in overall useful life On average iPhone provides an extra in value Taken another way iPhones monthly cost of ownership makes it value competitive with many lower end phones This superior value retention relative to other highend phones implies Apple has no incentive to lower prices or the need to invest aggressively to maintain its market share As a result Apples returns on invested capital are sustainable Analytical Approach Quantitative Analysis Our analytical approach is designed to calculate the different levels of sustainable cash flow a business is likely to produce From a statistical point of view one cannot evaluate a point estimate without knowing the distribution from which it is derived As a result we focus on calculating a distribution of the sustainable levels of free cash flow per share To start this process we manually rebuild a companys balance sheet and income statement with data from the past five to ten years The statements are then modified and normalized in terms of revenue These data are used to develop a set of operational metrics value drivers and to calculate the historical variance of the metrics The value drivers historical averages unless otherwise specified and their respective standard deviations are then put into a Monte Carlo simulation in order to generate a distribution of potential sustainable levels of free cash flow per share The final step is to compare this distribution to a point estimate which in our case is todays stock price This methodology allows us to identify situations in which the markets subjective expectations diverge significantly from historical norms and provides guidance as to the likely direction of the stock price It is clear that Apple revenue growth is likely to slow As a result this analysis assumes Apples revenue does not grow for the year forecast period Additionally we have increased the standard deviation of Apples revenue to B this compares to the year standard deviation of B The effects of these combined assumptions are to allow for instances where Apple revenue declines by standard deviations in the simulation Due to Apples significant resale value advantage it appears its margins are sustainable As a result they are set equal to their year averages In order to allow for increased volatility going forward these averages were varied by the year standard deviation The rate of new investment was set so as to keep the overall asset productivity constant because revenue growth is zero this requires an overall rate investment equal to depreciation What this simulation shows that lack of revenue growth is not enough to justify Apples low relative valuation Despite no revenue growth todays stock price of is below of all values As a result in order for todays stock price to be sustainable a significant and permanent deterioration in the companys ROIC has to occur in combination with a decline in sales Slowing revenue growth is not enough to explain Apples low valuation In order for Apples low valuation to be reasonable its margins and business model have to deteriorate While the data can always change Apples current significant cost of ownership advantage means this is unlikely for the foreseeable future Indeed provided the trend in the resale data persists Apple can be expected to continue to gain market share by offering a better value proposition As a result Apple stock is poised to break the trend established by MSFT and XOM Shareholders should enjoy continued steady gains over time making Apple the first company to sustain and grow a valuation in excess of B wwwstatistacomstatisticsgloba This data includes
