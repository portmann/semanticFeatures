#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will support an open source infrastructure for the Internet of Things in Windows Apple and Google already have their own offerings in this area A quarter century ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT overcame Apples NASDAQ AAPL early lead in PC technology with Windows which it described as open because it was licensed to many OEMs because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was very open to developers and because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had been allied with IBM NYSE IBM making MSDOS the preeminent operating system of the s Ask your dad <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>then fought a twodecade long war over control of the desktop first with free software then with open source software led by the Linux operating system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>lost that war a fall from grace that eventually led to the removal of the companys founding generation in the form of former CEO Steve Ballmer and his replacement last year by Satya Nadella an Indian immigrant who rose within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as head of its cloud unit called Azure Now Nadella hopes to overcome Apples current lead in device software devices are the new desktops by harking back to that open mantra this time with an overtly open source system called AllJoyn from an open source group called the AllSeen Alliance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has put support for AllJoyn into Windows its makeorbreak operating system update <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a premier member of the group and the only operating system vendor in that group The irony here is that AllSeen is a Linux Collaboration project At the time of that launch I noted that it was missing some key players like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and General Electric NYSE GE Neither is yet a member but there are a dozen premier members along with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and about other companies listed as community members These include software companies chip companies and networking companies like CenturyLink NYSE CTL Google and Apple both want to provide support for the IoT as it is known within their operating systems Google has Project Brillo and ties it to Android Apple has HomeKit Were talking here about a market that could be worth trillion in according to IDC with devices connectivity and services all expected to triple Just about every major tech company out there including Intel NASDAQ INTC and Samsung OTCSSNLF has a detailed Internet of Things strategy focused on their strengths Intel is focused on chips for instance and Samsung on devices and appliances The operating system however is the glue that binds all this together One key to winning that game has to be security tied identity The underlying structure must support strong identity it must be resistant to hacking and it must have enough marketing oomph behind it to convince skeptical consumers on these values It is expected that speech will be the interface for the Internet of Things and Microsofts Cortana is running a poor third here behind Google Voice and Apple Siri But this is where the open source movement may be Microsofts hole card Because so many people will have a hand in AllSeen at minimal investment and because no one company controls the underlying code it is going to be ferociously attractive to companies that dont want to lose control of their future to someone else This is basically what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>did with Windows until that proprietary operating system lost out to the moreopen Linux starting in the data center Now its taking that lesson on and using it against its main rivals This market just got interesting Source Microsofts Historic Turnabout In The
