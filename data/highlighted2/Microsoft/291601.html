manager of the Needham Aggressive Growth fund NEAGXO has not reduced his percent weighting in the company He expects slower but steady growth The law of large numbers is happening he said But nothing is dramatically broken with the iPhone market and we think Apple is going to continue to be the innovation leader driving it forward David Chieuhs Upright Growth Fund UPUPXO has a larger share of Apple percent than any other fund His fund was down percent over the three months through Wednesday partly because of Apple weakness but it has outperformed the SP over that period Apple stock could
