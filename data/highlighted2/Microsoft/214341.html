excited about tracking our fitness The good news is I am pounds lighter than I was a year ago How much of that is attributable to the Flex is up for debate Stock pickers could do worse than following the model developed by investing legend Peter Lynch He didnt merely excel at Beating the Street he trounced it At Fidelity Magellan the fund he ran his returns averaged percent annually during a year span Had you been lucky enough to put into Magellan when Lynch took over the fund in it would have grown to by the time he stepped down in an initial investment of would have made you a millionaire Lynchs advice for investors was straightforward Invest in what you know and understand expect to hold stocks for the long run research investments thoroughly focusing on company fundamentals most important of all look for companies with modest priceearnings ratios relative to growth PEG ratio A lower PEG ratio can indicate that a stock is inexpensive in light of its potential earnings growth Lets use Lynchs technique to look at the product Flex and the company Fitbit The idea of fitness trackers in general is great You cant manage what you cant measure Having metrics that let you track your activities is both helpful and motivational Succinct Summation of Weeks Events Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant off topic discussions it would be appreciated Lastly kindly forgo all civility in your discourse you are after all anonymous One of Peter Lynchs fundamental precepts was looking for companies with a moat to protect their assets and earnings for an extended period of time An example he gave as local quarry companies since heavy rock and earthen materials are expensive to truck and competition is limited to just a few miles away similarly their land was also only subject to competition within a few miles I dont see any moat at all for Fitbit It is small tech sitting on a wrist with dozens of small potential competitors as well as huge ones Apple Samsung come to mind The fitness basis for their algorithms is common knowledge I dont see any trade secrets or proprietary closed systems like Blackberrys communication network that could provide a moat for a few years before better designed competitors can take over One really good competitor and Fitbit is toast overnight like many companies in the tech world The best tech companies have fundamental embedded systems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>OS on billions of machines high quality operational systems Amazon laserlike focus on design Apple etc I only see Fitbit being a major company if they can become the Apple of fitness I agree completely and one of the things they would need to do to get to that point is establish a health database that one could share with doctors hospitals etc the key principle here being that the user owns the data they merely provide the repository to house it and make it available to all others Fitbit despite its users clamoring for an interface between the data Fitbit collects and Apples Health database I am told this is the requested feature by Fitbit users refuses to do so I am not clear on who owns the data Fitbit collects but they are acting as if they do not the user To me that sounds like an antimoat the sort of thing that competitors could use to drive a wedge between Fitbit and potential customers But that is probably just the way I see it as Jawbone has a product that is nearly identical to Fitbit except that the Jawbone product can interface with the Apple Health database and so far as I can see that does not appear to be drawing many customers to it If Fitbit were actively looking to prevent competitors from entering their market about the only tactic at their disposal is for them to leverage their large customer base by bringing out an everdecreasinginprice line of products using cost as their moat That does not seem to be the case as each new product is a bit more expensive as its predecessor a natural thing for most companies is to make their products increasingly profitable over time Fitbit may be a flash product that explodes in popularity and then fades away just as quickly or it may endure for a long time but there is nothing I can see in what it offers that will compete with a device that does all the same measurements and also is programmable In a few years the Apple watch and probably others as well will be ginormously more powerful run for a week on a charge and may even recharge itself from ambient RF noise cell towers TV stations wifi offering a platform that provides a hundred times the functionality of a Fitbit wrist band for less than double the price If Apple or Alphabet or <span
