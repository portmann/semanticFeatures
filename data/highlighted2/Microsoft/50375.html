his native Yunnan Province in southwest China Last November the year old entrepreneur who has no technology background strode into a Beijing ballroom to pitch his latest madeinChina product SPGnux a Linuxbased operating system he says could replace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corps Windows Information security is vital to the interests of China and the interests of the Chinese people Zhang proclaimed as a marketing video flashed images of former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden on large monitors Snowdens disclosures in of US cyberspying and security holes in American technology products have prompted Chinas government to accelerate a broad campaign to replace foreign technology with Chinesedeveloped systems And that has triggered a frenzy among stateaffiliated software firms investors and savvy businessmen all hoping to capitalize on Silicon Valleys waning grip over Chinas billionayear enterprise computing market Some of those whove entered the fray look better equipped to succeed than others When Hongqi a software company that developed Chinas most successful operating system during the s but which has since struggled put itself up for sale last year bidders included a coal magnate an aviation company and a food transport provider It was eventually sold to a company with a background in household cleaning for just million Were in a new bubble because of Snowden said He Weijia a former director at Hongqi These bosses dont need that much money or expertise to get into the game but the payoff can be potentially large International venture capitalists say Chinas startups are more attractive bets than before as Beijing is backing the enterprise computing sector much like it did Internet firms in the last decade This is obviously an area that the government wants to develop or promote how is this different from Baidu in said a Chinabased partner of a Silicon Valley venture capital firm referring to the Chinese search engine that debuted in New York a decade ago and is now worth billion With an unorthodox resume and a penchant for gold watches Zhang is an unlikely beneficiary of the postSnowden rush to push local technology a race that also illustrates how the industry in China is often influenced by the political climate After the Snowden leaks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>said it would stop supporting Windows XP leaving many computer systems potentially vulnerable to hackers Incensed Chinese leaders banned Windows in retaliation while antitrust regulators last year opened an investigation into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>focusing on its Windows and Office software sales practices Charlie Dai a senior analyst at Forrester said a few Chinese firms including Shanghaibased Standard Software and Wuhanbased Deepin both partowned by or tied to the central government have created viable operating systems for desktop PCs but Chinese banks are wary of using local software on servers that process the most critical data Qiao Yong a Standard Software vice president said Chinese technology has matured but it will take years before a big state agency like Chinas social security fund feels comfortable to transfer its servers to a local operating system The cybersecurity debate has helped raise the profile of Chinas Linux developers Qiao said but its also been a distraction Some leaders think we can do this overnight but it will take a very long time to reach a onethird market share much less reach Microsofts level Zhang says his Kunmingbased Sipu Enterprise Group has rolled out more than versions of SPGnux including ones in English Chinese and Arabic Since the Snowden revelations the number of government offices using SPGnux has more than doubled to and his company is profitable he said declining to detail financial or sales figures No one believed in us because we started at zero said Zhang who employs more than people working on SPGnux and counts Ni Guangnan an influential member of Chinas Academy of Engineering and Lenovo Groups founding chief technology officer as one of his firms supporters Public records show Sipus software has been purchased by agencies including Chinas State Oceanic Administration Aside from software tea and furniture Zhang said he has invested in films runs an importexport business and sells powdered Maca a Peruvian herbal supplement prized for its libidoboosting effects He said he is looking beyond China too and is courting customers in the Middle East and Southeast Asia markets he believes also want an alternative to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>A cockatoo is stuffed in a water bottle for illegal trade and more of our top photos from the last hours
