for their feature sets For years Apple NASDAQ AAPL has claimed that it only wanted to build the best possible iPhone in an oft repeated mantra With the arrival of the iPhone SE at Apples March special event designed specifically to be a more affordable model that mantra finally has been discarded The SE offers premium features at a bargain starting price of While the new SE may not move the needle much this quarter Apples shift in product strategy will have an impact for years to come Apple achieved something with the SE that even I didnt expect It packed most of the premium features of the iPhone s with the exception of D Touch and a large screen into a phone with a surprisingly low price point So it wouldnt be correct to say that Apple is moving down market but it is increasing its total addressable market which is really the point of offering a variety of form factors and price points That total addressable market appears to be not as small as analysts have assumed At Apples March special event Apple stated that it had sold million inch iPhones in This is double the predicted sales for the revamped iPhone SE according to Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital I think its reasonable to assume that the greatly enhanced SE will at least equal the million number The SE offers the A processor and NFC based Apple Pay of the iPhone s as well as the new k video capable Mpixel camera Apple saves money by continuing to use the case screen and probably battery from the old s D Touch was not included since this would have required a new screen to accommodate the pressure sensors and there was no room for the Taptic Engine anyway Overall Apples design choices for the SE represent a good compromise Yes I still think the A is overkill for such a small screen but use of the A was probably driven by considerations of economies of scale in A production Now that TSMC NYSE TSM has fully ramped their nm FinFET production using the A probably was more cost effective than using the older A based on TSMCs nm process Has Apple given up any margin on the SE Possibly compared to the s Basically the SE is a s with a new circuit card assembly and camera The new circuit card is probably a drop in replacement for the s and manufacturing cost difference would be minimal If economies of scale favored the use of the A over the A plus M motion coprocessor a separate chip then probably using the A was not much more expensive than the A in the s The upgraded Mpixel camera might have been the most expensive part of the upgrade Estimates of component costs are available from IHS and Techinsights I have previously argued that the total cost to manufacture the iPhone that these outfits come up with is too low However they might be reasonable at the component level IHS estimated in September the cost for the iPhone s of the A processor and M motion coprocessor at with the cameras estimated at Techinsights puts the A processor in the iPhone s at about and the cameras at The cost delta of is probably more due to the fact that the estimates came from different sources but it gives you a feel for the magnitude of the cost increase for the SE Its not much In my article The Myth of Enormous iPhone Profitability I concluded that iPhone gross margin is about higher than Apples corporate average but not enormously so Applying this gross margin to the base price yields an allinclusive cost to Apple of not too far away from the IHS total manufacturing cost of the GB iPhone s of from September I think its likely that Apple is holding close to their historical iPhone margin of The other half of the important product announcements at the March event was the new inch iPad Pro The small iPad Pro came with just about everything that was expected the AX processor from its larger Pro sibling provisions for a smart detachable keyboard and Apple Pencil and the quad speaker arrangement The biggest surprise and a much welcome one was the inclusion of the Mpixel camera from the iPhone s along with a flash A flash for the iPad camera has been long overdue Alas the new Pro camera lacks the optical image stabilization of the s Plus I really like the new iPad Pros They are the best iPads Apple has ever produced But I wish Apple would stop claiming that iPad Pro is a PC replacement Tim Cook had stated when the Pro was released that it is a replacement for the notebook or a desktop for many many people Apple has apparently decided to double down on the claim Unfortunately it just doesnt wash for many professionals Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro is a much better and more capable replacement for the traditional PC Windows is rather ungainly in its combination of desktop and tablet user interfaces but Surface Pro provides a set of capabilities that iPad Pro simply cant match This is the current reality I see where Apple is coming from though As Ive been pointing out Apples strategy is to position iOSiPad as the new personal computing platform So the claim that iPad Pro is a PC replacement is more a statement of intent and future direction But iOS will need to continue to evolve into a much more capable platform before it can be truly a PC replacement Were seeing signs of a similar positioning of Android by Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Google to be a PC alternative as I pointed out in Is Googles Android The Next PC Platform We now have what appears to be a threeway race between the major operating system vendors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Apple and Google to become the next dominant PC platform The outcome of that race is by no means certain But I give a slight edge to Android This pains me somewhat to say it but Google possesses a certain intellectual flexibility and agility that Apple has lacked This isnt an age thing Apple will be yearsold on April This isnt even a Tim Cook thing This is a ghost of Steve Jobs thing Apple is still trying to give us its vision of what it considers best in computing We were told at the event that the iPad Pro represents Apples vision of the future of personal computing I think Apple is on the right track but its a vision that still needs some work Im sure that many will wonder after hearing me complain like this why Im still an Apple investor Well for one thing no company is perfect Apple has flaws but it also has tremendous strengths And Im willing to make allowances for the fact that creative people have a need to pursue their unique visions Most importantly even when Apple goes off on a tangent the companys leadership has been able to course correct successfully After stubbornly claiming that the inch screen of the iPhone and s was the best size Apple eventually gave in to market pragmatism and produced the iPhone In that vein I expect Apple to converge iOS to a true personal computing platform in time Market pragmatism was really the fundamental story behind the March event Its market pragmatism that motivated Apple to produce the lowcost iPhone SE Its market pragmatism that has driven the introduction of the smaller lower cost iPad Pro While I dont expect either the iPhone SE or the new iPad Pro to have much impact on the March quarter the new pragmatism and willingness to compete on price are exactly what Apple needs to propel its future growth And its really market pragmatism that is driving Apple to position iOS as its preferred personal computing platform iOS is far larger and more profitable than Mac could ever be iOS has a huge ecosystem of apps that are all channeled and taxed through the iOS App Store The profits from the iOS ecosystem can fuel its blossoming into a competitive if not dominant personal computing platform I remain long Apple and consider it a buy I wrote this article
