Third times the charm The new fanless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface might finally convince consumers to buy it instead of the iPad Air or MacBook Air The more affordable Surface is ideal for enterprise users educators and graphic artists <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has intensified its campaign to steal customers away from Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPad Air and MacBook Air The new Surface in is a Windows tablet upgradeable to Windows that directly competes with the latest iPad Air Microsofts decision to offer a cheaper Surface could aggravate the declining sales of iPads Panos Panay Microsofts vicepresident for Surface products made it clear in a blog post that the cheaper Surface is also a laptop replacement for office workers Like the Surface Pro the Surface could also compete with the MacBooks The Surface is a bargain buy for IT managers looking to upgrade their corporate mobile computers Just look at the specs chart of this tabletnotebook and you will understand why I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a future bestseller in the Surface The Surface base model has more storage and bigger display than the iPad Air It comes with TB free cloud storage and year Office subscription The enterprisecentric Surface Pro was a blockbuster hit last year Panos now wants budgetconstrained colleges and small companies to try the Surface as their goto mobile productivity tool <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has already contracted to sell Surface units to the University of Phoenix Emirates Airlines BASF and Prada Panos believes that the Intel NASDAQ INTC Core i compute power of the Surface Pro is great but its too powerful for some daily office tasks The Surface is therefore the logical more cost effective solution to regular mobile office work The inch display of the Surface is smaller than the Surface Pro s inch screen However the Surface s x screen should be comfortable enough for regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Office usage email composition and web browsing The Surface is a tablet that can function as a fanless and lightweight office laptop Those people who hated the noisy fan of the Core ipowered Surface Pro will love the quiet productivity time with the Surface Like the new MacBook Air the Surface uses a lowpower Intel SoC that doesnt need a cooling fan The nanometer bit quadcore GHz can go up to GHz with Burst Technology Intel Atom XZ inside the Surface boasts a Scenario Design Power of only Watts Intels advancement in SoC design now made it possible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to come up with a full Windows tabletnotebook that is fanless and yet powerful enough to run Adobes NASDAQ ADBE Photoshop CC A Surface with only GB of RAM just got tested yesterday and it has excellent GeekBench benchmark scores The version of the Surface with GB of RAM would be perfect for digital illustrators and graphic artists The Atom X may not be powerful enough to work with advanced D modeling software like Autodesks NASDAQ ADSK Maya but I firmly believe it can run Donly Adobe Creative Cloud CC software The GB RAM version would help address the heavy RAM requirements of Adobes software The Surface s stylus is also similar to the Surface Pro s Ntrig pen Consequently pricesensitive graphic designers can buy the Surface and use it for digital illustrations with ease The version with GB of RAM is also sufficient for other graphic and illustration software that competes with Adobes products Based on handson experience Inkscape is a free and powerful alternative to Adobe Illustrator CC that runs well even on my old GB RAMequipped Acer Aspire One Netbook I can only testify that Xara Designer X Pro also works well on GB RAM computers My point now is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can exert more pressure on Apples iPad business by also coming up with a Surface with just GB of cheaper LPDDR RAM GB of storage and a smaller inch display Targeting the iPad product extends the total addressable market of the Surface A Surface becomes even attractive to budgetconscious design and advertising students Positioning the Surface for the education market is very important Microsofts Windows PC sales to US K education market is under assault from Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL cheap Chromebooks The last time I checked theres no consumercentric Chromebook or iPad that can run industrystandard Adobe or Autodesk software <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could benefit if it also expands its focus on US colleges and technical training schools The Surface has the potential to attract buyers from the enterprise education institutional and creative industries Yes Apple sells more iPads than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>does with its Surface tablets However let us not forget that no iPad can play the latest PC games Gamers are the other highly desirable target customers for a Surface The Gen GPU of the Atom xZ offers vast improvement in D gaming performance DoTA and League of Legends players who would like to play while laying down on their bed would appreciate the improved GPU of the Surface The Gen Intel HD graphics promises DMark Ice Storm performance than last years Atom Z The Asus OTCASUUY Transformer T has GB of RAM and has the old Atom Z and Gen HD graphics and it already delivers crisp Borderlands gameplay The inch display of the Surface makes it great for multiplayer online MOBA games like DoTA My point is that the cheaper Surface has a bigger total addressable market than the Surface Pro It also has a bigger market than the Apple iPad Air and Macbook Air This fact is a compelling reason to bear the negative scores that I Know Firsts predictive algorithm gave to MSFT The near term day and day forecast for MSFT says the stock is highly probable to suffer more downtrend The forecast machines of I Know First are also in line with the negative longterm technical indicators of MSFT I humbly suggest that Seeking Alpha
