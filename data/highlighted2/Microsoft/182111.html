class='textDiv'>The Obvious Case For Buying Apple Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Jae Jun Old School Value Stock Analysis Software clicks The proper way to value stocks and Apple Why you shouldnt blindly trust ROE for Apple I could try to squeeze out something about Apples direction with Apple Pay developments with iCar their lack of innovation by following the footstetps of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Surface the new iPhone S and something about their other product lines But for the biggest company in the world everything is already discussed everywhere and anywhere I actually get more insight and information by looking at the numbers Believe it not most people dont look at or discuss numbers in detail Many people will dance around that question Well that doesnt make sense because accounting is the language of business It speaks to you if you go through the numbers The other day Goldman came out with a month price target of per share I have no idea how Goldman can confidently guess that Apple shares will go up in months and hit to the dollar It assumes that all the variables will align with the stars and their selected scenario will be chosen On the other hand Prof Aswath Damodaran is one of the best at valuation and if you read his last valuation youll see a very different approach From his last update on Apple in July the most likely scenario according to this bell curve puts the value of Apple at around the mark From the highs of Apple hasnt fallen that much but the current price of does offer value Previously I went through some stock analysis ratios and techniques and I want to specifically cover some of them again here for Apple and then work out a valuation Its no surprise that ROIC is a great indicator of company performance CROIC is a variation that focuses on cash return on invested capital Its also labeled as CROCI cash return on capital invested Invested Capital Shareholders Equity Interest Bearing Debt Short Term Debt LongTerm Debt Basically it shows how well management is generating cash returns from the capital its investing If you zoom out more the average over the past years is and the fiveyear median is which is astounding At the peak in the CROIC was but consider that an outlier Takeaway When analysts and investors are crying about slowing growth check CROIC and see whether management is still performing at the same level CROIC shows that Apple generates cents for every dollar of invested capital Thats nothing to cry about Its better than other metrics like PS but if you dont know what you are looking at you can be misled Those are some impressive numbers But thats only on the surface Howard Marks says that to be successful in the stock market you need second level thinking ie go deeper and beyond what everybody else hears sees and thinks Anybody with an internet connection can find the ROE for AAPL from Google Finance or Yahoo Finance and will immediately assume that a ROE is kick ass By breaking down each component that makes up ROE you get much more insight Remember accounting is the language of business and this example of ROE is speaking to you Takeaway Some numbers look good at first but dig deeper to get the true picture and stay ahead of the herd It makes for a great girlfriend but not a good wife When you focus too much on earnings and not whats underneath the relationship wont last long Thats where the importance of FCF shines Having a balance sheet filled and growing with more cash offers the following thesis for an investment in Apple Downside protection When many companies acquire debt to work through difficult seasons Apple has the flexibility to enter new markets payments cars Better than the SP Apple already makes up a large portion of the SP but with its industry leading position its a bet that the company will perform better than the market over the long run Better than cash sitting in my account I started the year with about of cash in my portfolio and it has grown this year as I took profits Instead of holding too much cash Im happy to transfer my US dollars to AAPL dollars when valuations are reasonable like now With their management pricing power and business strength they are able to invest money in ways I cannot dream of FCF Yield Free Cash Flow Price per Share FCFS greater than is considered excellent Apples median FCFS over five years of is out of this world awesome Again it shows the strength of Apples business in being able to generate profit and cash Despite all the competition and cheap competitive products their ability to maintain their bottom line is magician like In hindsight it was media noise and fear mongering each time I dont see anything different today Takeaway Each company has a specific metric that works really well For AAPL its FCF and FCF Yield Focus on the fundamentals and ignore the noise My Valuation Range Gives an Intrinsic Range of Before getting to my range heres how I came up with my numbers FCF yield at or higher is a great time to buy On average Apple offers a FCF yield of around Do some simple algebra to see what the stock price has to be in order to fetch a FCF yield of Using the current FCF per share the price comes out to FCF per share fair value I also dont stop with one valuation number because I like to look at valuation from different viewpoints Using the EVEBIT multiple to work through the income statement is another simple way of seeing the range of possibilities Sticking with the current x EVEBIT multiple with current numbers the normal case comes out to So my intrinsic value range is between to but my senses tell me its in the range Note that I dont have an estimate of when the intrinsic value will be reached It could take months like Goldman Sachs three months or four years In the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine Just focus on the price you pay and youll do just fine Its just tedious and time consuming Thats why most people dont do it and buy things based on what theyve heard or by following their gut instincts The only difficult part of investing is knowing what is noise and what is important Most stuff you read on the news is unimportant If youre reading the news and worries sink in about China you cant look at a company objectively Start with the numbers first and then move into documents and filings By starting with fundamental analysis youll eliminate a lot of noise and be able to focus on making better decisions Why waste hours going through articles and news only to realize that the company is a crap shoot By going with the fundamentals its a tremendous advantage to have compared to the majority of people and analysts who dont
