stock has had an incredible run over the past year But Apples capital allocation program heavily skewed toward buybacks over dividends leaves income investors in a tough spot Apple is likely to pass along another modest dividend increase next month because it prefers buybacks and also since the vast majority of its cash is held overseas At a yield income investors might want to think about taking some Apple profits off the table and reinvesting in a higher yielding stock of which there are many It goes without saying that there is no stock more obsessed over than Apple NASDAQ AAPL right now Apple is the subject of much stock market discussion and because of this Im starting to wonder whether all this Apple hype is a sign of a contrarian indicator After all it wasnt that long ago that Apple was in a similar position of do no wrong territory then proceeded to lose half its value Apple might be ripe for a correction because after its rally over the past year its likely that Apple now represents a disproportionate percentage of an investors portfolio For me personally Apple now constitutes approximately of my retirement portfolio which concerns me And Im betting that many other investors are in a similar position It may be appropriate for income investors to consider taking some profits if your exposure to Apple has gotten too high Heres why income investors should think about rebalancing their portfolios to use Apples huge stock price gains to generate more income Income Investors Are In A Very Tough Spot Before Apples tremendous increase in stock price it offered a great opportunity for income investors My own cost basis is per share meaning I personally enjoy a yield on cost based on Apples current per share annualized dividend But yield on cost is not a perfect metric as it is a purely backwardlooking measure Apples dividend yield when I bought was far higher than it is now Apples current yield is just at a stock price of per share That is the reinvestment rate and the yield that investors should be concerned with more so than the yield on cost The yield on cost being significantly higher than the current yield has much more to do with Apples huge increase in stock price rather than dividend growth Apple delivered just a dividend increase last year Its due to increase its dividend again next month and Apple needs to go big on a dividend raise if it wants to keep income investors satisfied Another increase simply wont be enough to convince income investors to hold the stock as even a raise would only lift Apples yield to If Apple is serious about retaining income investors at both the retail and institutional levels it will need a much larger dividend increase But for Apple this is harder to do than it seems On the surface it seems that Apple should have no trouble passing along a huge dividend raise since analysts expect another earnings growth in fiscal to per share Considering the fact that Apple pays just in dividends and has billion in cash and marketable investments on its balance sheet it seems crazy for Apple not to pass along a major dividend increase However its also true that a lot of Apples cash hoard is held overseas Apple doesnt have access to this cash unless it pays a high repatriation tax which it has signaled no intention of doing The only other option for Apple to access its own cash to finance its capital allocation program is to take on debt which it has done Apples longterm debt went from billion at the end of fiscal to billion at the end of fiscal Apple has conducted some bond sales more recently such as a billion debt issue last month But even in this case Apple clearly prefers to utilize these funds for buybacks and chooses not to pass along very high dividend increases Use Apples Massive Stock Price Gain To Your Advantage Im an income investor and my personal investing goal is to generate high income from my investments When I bought Apple and formed my position the stock was yielding well over But Apples massive rally and small dividend increases might force my hand As much as I admire Apple as a company love its products and am glad to see my position double in value my core income goal is not being satisfied to its fullest Apple now yields well below the overall stock market and unless it significantly increases its dividend this will remain so At of my IRA I can significantly increase my portfolios income generation by trimming some of my Apple position and reinvesting in a higher yield This makes more sense given Apples massive stock price increase since investors are essentially playing with house money The good news is that even within the technology sector there are many highly profitable companies that offer higher yields and stronger dividend growth than Apple like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and the list goes on While its easy to get caught up in the neverending Apple hysteria practical portfolio management needs to be maintained Im an income investor and in support of that philosophy it might be time for income investors to consider taking some of their Apple profits off the table and reinvesting in a higher yield elsewhere Source Why It Might Be Time To Take Some Apple Profits Disclosure The author is long AAPL MoreThe author wrote this
