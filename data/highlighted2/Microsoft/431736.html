class='textDiv'>Disney Dont Abandon Infinity License It The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Disney recently stated that it would not be producing more Infinity titles While Disney probably shouldnt publish videogames it should aggressively increase its licensing programs in this area Disney NYSE DIS decided to exit the videogame business At least it decided to exit the business of directly producing software and toystolife products ie Disney Infinity But the company isnt totally out of videogames instead it apparently wants to switch to a familiar strategy license its properties to publishers Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA Battlefront title is a recent example The licensing model always made sense to me Why directly publish games and take the risk Even when times were great in the industry when physical discs werent disrupted by digital delivery and price points werent as controversial people seem to dislike paying over for a game these days more than they did in the past in my anecdotallybased opinion and when mobile casual platforms werent competing for the attention of users I always wondered why Disney was investing in developers Taking increased risk on by producing filmed content episodic series and park attractions was logical since that was the companys core business competency directly producing such ancillary consumer products based on IP that was already expensively developed didnt appear as attractive as sitting back and collecting payments from others as IP moves its way through other channels it would seem requisite that keeping the profit margin high would be desirable since the goal is to make one big investment on a franchise and then develop a long tail of monetization whose risk is funded by other entities Disney should therefore certainly not shutter its Infinity line completely then its hard for me to believe thats the true plan I would like to see as a shareholder of the company these figures ported over to another toystolife platform Would Activision Blizzard NASDAQ ATVI be interested in developing future iterations of Infinity for its Skylanders portal Possibly one might argue Then theres Lego Dimensions and its gaming system Nintendo has Amiibo perhaps Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY would be the most logical choice for an Infinity comeback given not only the videogame companys family image but also the fact that it needs new ideas itself <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT and Sony NYSE SNE also should consider bidding for the privilege to publish and host more of this part of the Disney universe Lets not stop there though Infinity is Infinity and it is an important trademark that should not be totally abandoned but there are all kinds of opportunities in this licensing arena Disney should aggressively increase its exposure to retail shelves dedicated to gaming Every Disney Channel show for instance could have a videogame version The companys popular ABC shows could likewise see gaming treatments It might seem like it would be too much of a good thing but that isnt necessarily the case making more titles but maybe less of each of one of them so as to not flood the market would keep the Disney logo in the eye promote the licensed properties and hopefully increase revenue from interactive entertainment The key is to keep development costs low just make simpler games that dont require a huge investment in time on the part of the player or a high suggested retail price A game based on Disney Channels Girl Meets World wouldnt need to be a longterm affair on the scale of something like Call of Duty It might sound odd to suggest making say a DS or PS version of Girl Meets World but Disney has done this to similar titles in the past Thats So Raven and Phil of the Future come to mind they were both represented on the GameBoy as an example Kim Possible was on both handheld platforms and PlayStation Home Improvement could be found on the SuperNintendo believe it or not The company has a long history of licensing its stories to videogame platforms That wont stop Further focus should be made on expanding this business no matter whether the industry is in contraction or expansion mode In addition to increasing the amount of videogame product based on current Disney content I would like to see more remakes of classic Disney titles there were updated versions of Duck Tales originally on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse which was a Sega Genesis cartridge There are many many games the company could bring back for todays players not doing so would be leaving money on the table I would not want Disney to suddenly become a videogame company that is not its prime mission statement But the companys brand possesses a lot of value to licensees and any entity that wants to publish a new Disney game or remake an older one with all the bells and whistles of current computing technology should be courted The company should start to seriously map out a strategy of growth for this part of its empire as I believe it can be a big generator of value for consumer products if properly planned and executed Disclosure I amwe are long DIS ATVI I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Services Entertainment Diversified </div></body></html>
