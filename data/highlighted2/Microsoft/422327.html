NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha There are only two AAArated companies left now Johnson Johnson and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>We put up a financial boxing match between these two super heavyweight champions The three boxing rounds the dividend ratios and value The th of April marked the end of an era ExxonMobile Corp NYSE XOM was stripped of its pristine AAAcredit rating by Standard and Poors It had held that medal of excellence since but this oil bear market was too harsh even for the best of companies to get out unharmed That means there are only two AAArated companies left now Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT These two juggernauts are in completely different sectors healthcare and technology but a lot of investors especially those focused on income have these stocks in their portfolio or on their watch list They are as safe as can be and they are both qualified dividend growers Lets put up a boxing match between those two giants to see which company would come out as the one and only company with an AAA a special credit rating by From Growth to Value This comparison will be put up like an Olympic amateur boxing match which means that it will have three rounds of each three minutes three components Johnson and Johnson and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>are often part of a DGI portfolio dividend growth investing which means that the dividend must be reliable that the yield should be high enough and growing at an attractive pace These are the three criteria minutes we are looking at in round Both companies have a very reliable history of paying and increasing dividends Johnson Johnson is one of the Dividend Kings companies that have paid rising dividends for more than years In the case of JNJ years I guess a lot of you were not even born in or didnt have a stock portfolio yet JNJ Payout Ratio NYSE TTM data by YCharts As you can see JNJs payout ratio still leaves room for growth Although is has gone up recently it is still very safe at MSFT Payout Ratio TTM data by YCharts Now this is a graph most DGI dont want to see a payout ratio of more than But dont worry this is a one time exception EPS for next year are expected to be which would put the dividend per share back at about a payout ratio Conclusion of the first minute of boxing both boxers are doing well but MSFT showed a short moment of weakness about the dividend payout Currently the SP yield stands at Both JNJ and MSFT are above average yielders JNJs yield is just above that of MSFT but you could say they are almost identical MSFT Dividend Yield TTM data by YCharts According to Yahoo Finance JNJ has a year average yield of so its current yield is historically a bit low MSFT has a year average yield of so its dividend is a bit higher than its historical average This is of course because MSFT has a more recent dividend than JNJ and had to raise more to get even Conclusion of minute two of the boxing match both super heavyweights seem to keep each other in balance Just a few percentage points lead for JNJ on yield Of course since MSFT only started a dividend years ago its dividend growth is higher than JNJs JNJ is growing its dividend very evenly at a pace of middle single digits As a young dividend doggy MSFTs raises are jumping higher and now are at but seem to decelerate Both companies are solid dividend plays but MSFT is no match for JNJs dividend history There are no absolute truths in the stock market but I think the reliability of JNJs dividend is about as close to certainty as you can get So in our triple Afight the first round is given for JNJ Not with a wide margin but like a champion that has everything under control against the challenger and has the advantage of the experience of having fought to defend the title before But MSFT is doing great so far and JNJ has to look out for a blow in round and There are of course numerous ratios that are used by investors But we will look at three The PE ratio is probably the most common and known to all investors but I think PFCF and ROE are at least as important as the PE to determine the strength of our super heavyweights The price to earnings ratio is maybe the simplest ratio there is especially to evaluate value stocks such as MSFT and JNJ As you can see on the graph below JNJs PE is at now This seems a bit high compared with the last ten years the average PE of JNJ is JNJ PE Ratio TTM data by YCharts MSFT PE Ratio TTM data by YCharts As you can see MSFTs PE is a lot higher at But last summer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>wrote down B related to its mobile phone business which it had taken over from Nokia Normally the PE ratio would be more like in this FAST graph This shows that MSFTs normal PE ratio is while it is now There is no shred of doubt JNJ comes out as the winner here MSFT has a weak moment Even if you take into account the normalized PE JNJ is closer to its average But the picture should be made complete by also taking into account the forward PE This is of course less factual because estimates of the earnings of the next year are involved but for such widely followed companies as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and Johnson Johnson the estimates are often quite reliable JNJ PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts At this moment JNJ has a forward PE ratio of which is very high compared to the last ten years Only at the end of the forward PE ratio was higher than now MSFT PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts Microsofts forward PE ratio is a lot more moderate than the ttm PE ratio of But here too you can see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is valuated very richly compared to the last ten years Conclusion of the first minute of round Both stocks seem to be inflated if you look at both the PE and forward PE ratio which is higher than almost any moment in the last ten years If I have to choose one of the two it would be JNJ because its ttm PE ratio is closer to its historical average than MSFTs The FCF Free Cash Flow is a very important metric it determines how much money is left to distribute to shareholders to buy back shares and to reinvest in the company The price to FCF is the market capitalization divided by the free cash flow The lower the outcome is the better This metric is often considered as being superior to the PE ratio because you can not manipulate it as you can manipulate especially nonGAAP earnings JNJ Price to Free Cash Flow TTM data by YCharts As you can see from the chart Microsofts PFCF is at which is lower than JNJs On the other hand you could say that JNJs PFCF has historically been lower since the Great Depression of In other words the market values JNJs FCF higher than MSFTs What you can also see from the chart is that both companies have quite elevated PFCF numbers compared to their recent history The return on equity or ROE is a very important ratio to consider if you are a stockholder of a company It is the income that a company can make on the shareholders money The higher the ROE the more efficient a company is A high ROE means more bang for the buck you could say The ROE depends of course on the sector the company operates in but both the healthcare as the technology sector have traditionally high ROEs So lets just compare JNJ Return on Equity TTM data by YCharts As you can see JNJs ROE is quite stable mostly between and MSFTs has had a very high ROE more than but it has come down recently Both companies have a quite high ROE if you look at their competitors MSFTs compares well to that of the software industry which is according to gurufocuscom JNJs ROE is a lot higher than the major drugs manufacturers industry which has a average ROE of Johnson Johnson wins on the PE because it is a bit less overvalued compared to its own historical PE both trailing twelve months and forward The ROE is a close call MSFTs ROE has come down recently but that is partly because of the amortization of its mobile phone department But still this counts and probably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will write down another M in the second quarter If you compare the ROE with the industry median MSFT outflanks the competition by but JNJ leaves the industry in the dust by And so the conclusion is clear JNJ prevails in round because it scores better on PE and ROE Round Value present past and future You all know that price is what you pay value is what you get We will look at the present past and future of the triple A stocks in round The present is the present value you get in other words is the stock price attractive now to buy JNJ or MSFT The performance is the past value how much has it gone up The future is the value that the stocks will get in the future Valuation matters of course Your future return depends for a part on the valuation the moment you buy your stock Is this historically a good time to buy JNJ or MSFT shares If you take the current price of JNJ and you want to calculate its fair value according to the PE ratio you should divide the price by the current PE and multiply by the average PE ratio You would get this x According to this method JNJs fair value would be which makes that JNJs stock is just slightly overvalued by For MSFT we will be mild and we will not include the onetime amortization which means that MSFT has a PE ratio of With a price of this would be mean the average MSFT price if you divide by and multiply by is an overvaluation of all ratios are familiar to most investors or can be looked up except these PL VL Peter Lynch value EPSx FV yr FG fair value in according to FAST Graphs US IV Uncle Stock s intrinsic value average TP average analysts target price according to finvizcom As you can see both companies seem to be overvalued according to the average of all these prices but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is more overvalued than Johnson Johnson so JNJ wins this first minute of the third round As for the past performance both companies have done a great job especially if you have used the dividends to buy more shares dripping This is the result of the last ten years Click to enlargeAs you can see MSFT has outperformed JNJ But if you would have bought MSFT just before the crisis the outperformance would have been smaller This is because JNJs beta is lower than MSFTs versus So the moment of buying determines your profit If you would buy MSFT now and a new crisis would knock at the door pretty soon the probability is rather high that JNJ outperforms MSFT But what about a DRIP Dont quit your daily job has a great tool to calculate your return if you would have dripped these and other stocks As a side note I always take as a starting amount and not I have explained why here So as you can see MSFT wins both for the capital gains as for the DRIP investing Minute of round goes to MSFT Of course predicting the future is often difficult and uncertain It also has a qualitative side and a quantitative side The quantitative aspect is the part where the earnings growth earnings multiples the analysts consensuses share buybacks and future dividends all belong besides much more numbers For JNJ you can find them for example here here and here for MSFT you can read about quantitative aspects here here and here The qualitative aspect is what specialists see as the future in the long run It comments on questions such as Will there be new possibilities for the company to extend their product range How is the company positioned compared to competitors Both themes alone qualitative and quantitative are the subject of many articles here on SA For MSFT you can find interesting qualitative articles here here and here for example for JNJ here a very good first article Mark here and here Of course a lot of articles mix the two qualitative and quantitative So how looks the future of JNJ and MSFT I think both of these companies have a great future ahead both with their strengths and weaknesses And there will be a lot of articles and comments on details that could be important for the future of these wonderful companies I dont want to choose on the future aspect between JNJ and MSFT You could bring up positive and negative arguments for both Maybe you want to comment on either or both companies future Please feel free to post your idea in the comment section It was a close call the future is a tie MSFT won the overall past return but JNJ is closer to its fair value than MSFT This last item is more important than the past so JNJ wins narrowly Round the dividend was won by JNJ because of its superb dividend track Round the ratios was also for JNJ but only slightly Round value was won by JNJ because it is probably less overvalued than MSFT So the conclusion is clear In the fight of the two AAA super heavyweight champions both showed why they are considered to be champions It was a fight between two worthy opponents But the special From Growth to Value AAA label goes to JNJ If you liked this article feel free to click the follow button Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote
