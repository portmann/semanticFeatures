Windows is bringing with it a range of perspectives on the eagerly awaited operating system and what it means for the future of computing One of the biggest questions has been around its impactor lack thereofon PC sales As anyone whos watched tech industry news for the last year or so knows the PC market has hit tough times with last quarters shipments falling around yearoveryear according to market research houses like IDC and Gartner As a result the PC industry is clamoring for something that will help reinvigorate it and drive new sales In the past a new Windows OS release was generally cause for celebration in the PC hardware and component business because it typically drove solid boosts in shipmentsnot always right away but definitely within a year or so of it release This time around however things could be different <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has made it clear that Windows will be completely free for one year after its release to anyone owning a PC running a legitimate copy of Windows or Windows Because of this some industry watchers are presuming that instead of buying new PCsas theyve typically done with major OS transitions in the pastmany people will simply upgrade their existing PCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has actually made this pretty simple to do The hardware requirements for Windows are extremely low by todays standardsif youve purchased a PC over the last years its probably capable of running Windows Plus based on my own experience on several different machinesas well as reading the accounts of many others doing upgradesthe company has done a good job of making the upgrade process smooth and relatively carefree Of course we wont really know until the final bits have been propagated out to the hundreds of millions who are expected to make the upgradea process likely to take several weeksbut early indications seem pretty solid Despite this Im still hopeful that the PC industry will see some decent upside from Windows particularly in the fourth quarter of this year and into The primary reason for my optimism is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has actually integrated quite a few new capabilities into Windows that will benefit from new hardware Some are more wellknown and more obvious than others but here are some of the key new functions that I think can and should drive new Windows PC hardware purchases Windows HelloThe new biometric login feature for Windows points the way to a passwordless future at long last To take advantage of it you need to have either a new fingerprint reader or an integrated D camera like Intels RealSense built into your PC Down the road <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is expected to support other types of biometric authentication methods such as iris scan In addition the company is also expected to leverage standards efforts with the FIDO Alliance to extend biometric authentication onto other devices and services Hopefully it wont be long before you can digitally authenticate to your Windows PC from a wearable and then use that authentication to transparently log you in to your online banking site ecommerce site and more Windows ContinuumThe Continuum features will make in devices like Microsofts Surface Dells Inspiron Series HPs x and Lenovos Yoga even more compelling The OS can automatically adjust the user interface and details like icon sizes allowing you to easily switch from PC mode to tablet mode Eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will also release Continuumenabled Windows smartphones that will allow you to directly connect your phone to a monitor and keyboard Array Microphones for CortanaWith Windows s new personal assistant feature you will likely talk to your computer a lot more than you ever have and a highquality array microphonewhich essentially integrates multiple mics working in tandem across the front of your PCcan make a big difference in the accuracy of speech recognition DirectXThe latest iteration of Microsofts key gaming API comes bundled with Windows and enables an impressive range of new capabilities for PCs with improved graphicswhether it be dedicated GPUs from nVidia or AMD or even the graphicsenhanced sixth generation APUs codenamed Carrizo that AMD just released Games that support DirecX can now fully support multicore CPUs as well as better support multiple GPUs better leverage GPU memory and much more GPU AccelerationThe new GPUs and APUs arent just for gaming either Many different elements of the Windows UI as well as video playback web page rendering JavaScript performance and much more now benefit from hardware GPUs By themselves none of these elements are game changing but taken together they should provide a much smoother visual experience on new Windows hardware Display ScalingSpeaking of displays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has also made working with multiple displays andor higher resolution displays much easier Gone are the days of unreadable icons and text on highresolution screens New CPUsBoth Intel and AMD are making important new introductions to their line of CPUsthe upcoming Skylake from Intel and the previously mentioned Carrizo from AMD As with any new CPU release the performance will improve but more importantly each is expected to offer important improvements in battery life and in the quality of its integrated graphics Given the growing role of graphics acceleration across Windows these developments are important even for nongamers Wireless ChargingAn additional benefit that Intels expected to bring to the table in the early fall is a new chipset platform for its Skylake CPUs that will offer wireless charging using the new Rezence standard on certain higherend notebook PCs Of course another key benefit of getting a new PC along with a new PC OS is the clean slate fresh start Most people tend to accumulate lots of stuff on their PCs over timeextra applications files desktop icons etcand the ability to start over is often one of the nicest benefits of getting a new PC Not everyone who upgrades to Windows will need new PCs obviously but for those who may be interested and choose to do the research there actually are some pretty compelling reasons for buying new hardware The percentage of those who choose to do so will be a critical metric to closely watch Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The
