</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has become a strong vendor in the market for IT software particularly in the cloud MSFT has become a leader in terms of its technology in many key software categories as measured by leading market researchers The companys relatively new CEO has done away with some of the less enlightened practices of the Steve Ballmer era particularly in terms of supporting far more open platforms than heretofore Microsofts success like that of all cloud software companies is being masked by the switch to more and more subscription pricing The companys commercial business actually saw a expansion in constantcurrency bookings last quarter but reported only revenue growth Ive always thought of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT as a company with a strong consumer franchise that sort of edged into applications almost by accident Now you are asking your readers to believe that the future of MSFT is in its commercial business Can a middleaged leopard really change its spots all that much Many investors still consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a company with strong franchises in a declining market Torrents of electrons course from the pens of analysts to the eyes of investors regarding the latest jiggle or enhancement of Windows or enhancements that will allow developers to create an even larger ecosystem The latest developers conference Build was primarily about biometric authentication coupled with an emphasis on speech recognitionnatural language processing Sometimes analysts talk about the annuity stream that MSFT has created for itself with Office A fair proportion of the literate and numerate population of the globe continues to pay for the product and its many options as a utility But beneath the surface so to speak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been becoming a company that concentrates on the commercial marketplace I will discuss some of the details of the transformation with a bit of granularity below but the fact is that the TAM in the commercial space for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>really the TAM for its Azure cloud offering is far greater than the TAM is for Windows or for operating systems or for anything else it might sell to the consumer Of course the companys consumer products and software and hardware revenues remain important They are a longterm annuity for this company But as most investors are aware and have been aware those markets are in longterm secular decline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>might be able to find stability from its personal productivity business segments at some point but any sustained or significant growth appears unlikely If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is going to achieve significant and steady growth it is because it is becoming an enterprise software company that derives most of its revenues by selling enterprise solutions to enterprise users I think that some observers felt that the companys results last quarter were a significant milepost that the butterfly was emerging from its chrysalis Thats one thing important to note Microsofts transition is difficult to see and will remain difficult to see for some time to come The published results for MSFTs commercial business are depressed because more and more revenues are ratable and much of the success the company is enjoying is essentially sitting in unbilled backlog Last quarter saw commercial bookings rise in constant currency but commercial revenues rose Obviously that same phenomenon is going to impact the operating profits as well Microsofts shares were mired in their own private bear market since the days of the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century From the start of the century all the way through until the shares hovered in a range that was centered just a little below In the last threeplus years the shares have more than doubled partially because the companys financial model has changed to one that emphasizes subscriptions and partially because it has been willing to return a far greater proportion of its free cash flow to investors through a combination of dividend increases and not an insubstantial level of share repurchases which reached of MSFTs enterprise value in the last fiscal year I think that the recognition of the companys cashgenerating capabilities and its financial engineering have probably done about all that they can do for the shares at this point The companys EVS is no longer in value territory at over X for the current fiscal years ends and at X for fiscal The company has a PE based on consensus nonGAAP earnings of X for this year Its free cash flow yield for the current fiscal year is likely to be approximately Those are not deep value numbers and to sustain further share price increases is going to require some real growth The growth isnt going to come from what MSFT describes as personal computing although that segment actually has achieved grown this fiscal year albeit at some modest percentage It more or less has to come from the companys commercial segments I think that there is a case to be made that the company has been moving to become an enterprise software company now a dozen years or more and it is finally starting to produce some numbers and projections to validate that point I think that despite its current valuation the shares are still a reasonable investment not so much because of its value status as because the company should be able to achieve a sustainable level of modest growth going forward The Old Grey Lady Of Seattle Isnt All That Grey These days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported its earnings for its fiscal Q on January Many analysts considered the earnings to be a sort of breakout Overall reported revenues were down a bit although marginally ahead in constant currency The commercial components of the companys business what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>calls Productivity and Business Process increased by in constant currency and the business segment that MSFT calls Intelligent Cloud which should not be confused with Azure its public cloud offering rose by The companys PC business unit declined by in constant currency The kudos that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>received was for its growth in nonGAAP constantcurrency EPS and a very strong performance that constituted an upside surprise of from anticipated levels So far as it goes despite the significant earnings beat company guidance for the full year did not change materially Consensus revenue growth expectations for this year are still negative and revenue growth expectations for fiscal are only EPS growth expectations are a little bit better The current consensus forecast shows EPS rising this year and next year There is self evidently a significant disconnect between published consensus estimates and the companys current valuations Over the past four quarters the company has produced upside EPS surprises ranging between and I have to imagine that at the least analysts who have increased their ratings on this name in the past months have done so with the expectation that the company will soundly beat estimates As it is MSFT has a relatively low consensus recommendation on the ThomsonFirst Call scale of Again my expectation is that most of those ratings were put in place during the time of the companys consistent and relatively largesized declines in its personal productivity segment that were not being offset by growth in its commercial and cloud offerings Again if this company is to be a successful investment from this point it can only be so because the commercial and cloud segments show accelerated growth and improved margins I dont think that such a conclusion is a new one but it has more urgency at this point after the shares have doubled based on massive capital returns over the past three years The company generated operating cash flows of billion in its last fiscal year It paid out billion in dividends and it bought back billion in stock It also had capex of billion so there is simply not enough cash available to return more cash to shareholders without borrowing in the US Of the companys cash flow during fiscal adjustments to net income more than doubled last year to over billion or of cash flow That is not a new sustainable source of operating flow It will likely decrease this year I think it is relatively plain that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cannot continue to increase returns to shareholders without a significant improvement in the cash flow that is derived from the operating segments of its business Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has a significant net cash balance of billion or about share but like most IT vendors most of its cash is offshore and to increase its capital returns it would have to increase borrowings in the US In order to try to increase its returns to shareholders I doubt that is really going to happen There has been lots written mainly critical and perhaps deservedly so about Microsofts former CEO Steve Ballmer He certainly did not embrace many of the changes in the IT world enthusiastically and both employee morale and the pace of innovation from MSFT slowed during his tenure That being said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has spent the better part of the last two decades in becoming an enterprise software company with offerings that appeal to most sizes of enterprises It is probably fair to say that the prior management was not as consistently committed to the strategy of the company becoming an enterprise software company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has developed a variety of consumer products of various merits along the way and whether they have been successful or not they ultimately have been a diversion from the only strategy that can restore the company to growth But that is the past and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is now led by Satya Nadella who replaced the former CEO a bit more than two years ago Mr Nadella has spent most of his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>career either working on Web projects or in leading the Business Solutions group which was the forerunner of Dynamics By he got another promotion to the presidency of the Service Tools Division Fortunately the Sever Tools division was the home of the Azure cloud platform There are many things that one can say about the tenure of Mr Nadella but he has obviously embraced new thinking for this company despite the fact that he has worked there for years Needless to say it helps that the current CEO came up through the commercial and Web components of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>business As mentioned earlier Microsofts commercial business is actually significantly stronger than the headline numbers might suggest In point of fact as the company sells more of its products on the cloud its balance of commercial deferred revenues will continue to rise And beyond the deferred revenue that is actually on the balance sheet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>like salesforcecom NYSE CRM and many other cloudbased software vendors has built a significant balance of what is described as contracted not billed balance which reached an alltime high of billion The company actually had a bookings increase of in commercial in constant currency but much of that bookings increase is going into both deferred revenues which were up by in the commercial silos year on year to just under billion and into the contracted not billed balance Further what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>reported that its commercial annuity mix which is essentially the amount of revenues coming through longterm subscription arrangements increased by percentage points to While it may not be totally recognized MSFT has the same issues in terms of reporting the health of its commercial business as is the case for many other cloudsubscription software companies Long before Mr Nadella took the reins there had been signs of life in some of the companys enterprise business units Indeed Gartner now shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has displaced Oracle NYSE ORCL from that companys longheld position as the most capable database Oracle still is No by market share mainly because its database solutions cost so much more than everyone else MSFT probably has the most actual users Gartner talks about the companys recent enhancements to Azure DocumentDB the managed NoSQL database in the cloud and SQL Servers hybrid capabilities to run onpremises and in the cloud Gartner went on to write about Microsofts vision for inmemory computing across products hybrid cloud implementations and a cloud first strategy Readers Im simply the messenger here make no claims to have independent firsthand knowledge as to whether the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>DB offerings are better than those of Oracle But I have to start somewhere and Gartner is typically thought to be the most pervasive of the market research sources that are available The takeaway is that Oracle which has been in the top spot of the Gartner MQ seemingly forever is now No I will comment later in this article as to how open source products are eating into the database market as a whole The fact is that the database market is rapidly commoditizing and the value addprice that any branded vendor can enjoy is likely shrinking For the last several years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and its Dynamics product suite have enjoyed some level of parity with both Oracle and SAP NYSE SAP in the ERP market at least judged by market share Dynamics is still mainly found in the SMB market but the SMB market is large enough and Oracle has never wanted to play in that sandbox Dynamics is a far less complex solution than what SAP offers Needless to say Dynamics offers smaller users some of whom may actually still be using Excel spreadsheets the look and feel of other Windows applications Sometimes management chooses to conflate Dynamics with Microsofts CRM offering All that being said before the switch to cloud really got underway say all the way back in Dynamics was thought to be a business running at billionyear It is perhaps larger these days with only CRM competing in the cloud space It appears that most of that business has already migrated to the cloud Management said that more than of its CRM customers are deploying in the cloud and that CRM online is driving continued tripledigit seat growth Dynamics has not yet been released for cloud deployment Somewhat surprisingly to me Dynamics actually enjoyed an constantcurrency growth rate this past quarter all of it onprem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been in the BI space for the past decade or so It has taken quite a long time but at this juncture at least from a product functionality standpoint and at least using Gartners MQ analysis MSFT in analytics has gotten to the top of the tree Again I just use Gartner as a baseline some readers have different opinions and Im certain that will be the case I do not know what I might use that is more objective And whatever else is true MSFT is now considered by Gartner to be the absolute best vendor for BI and analytics which is a significant change from earlier surveys Gartner also publishes a survey for what it calls advanced analytics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was said to have the best technology in that space a significant jump from the survey That being said MSFT still has a way to go before catching IBM NYSE IBM and SAS Institute the two leaders in terms of execution capability But really the transformation process for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is all about the cloud Overall what MSFT describes as its intelligent cloud business grew just to billion last quarter So cloud now represents a bit less than of total revenues The way MSFT defines things and Oracle defines things in the last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had X the revenue coming from the cloud compared to ORCL and the percentage of total revenue coming from cloud was X greater than it was for Oracle Within the intelligent cloud bucket server revenues grew by and Azure revenues grew by The commercial cloud annual run rate has now risen to billion or about of total MSFT revenues Obviously the commercial cloud is the most appropriate measure of revenue comparable to the other vendors in the space and is a subset of the intelligent cloud Im not sure that if there is any other company that I either follow or know about that has quite as many definitions and buckets as this one although I doubt it is deliberate It just tends to hide things Microsofts management has articulated a goal of reaching billion in revenues in the commercial cloud by That seems to be quite a modest goal Commercial cloud apparently grew by in the last quarter Reaching billion in revenues by would represent a CAGR of around through that period which is far less than I think is a reasonable projection I would look to the performance of that category specifically to generate significant upsides to the current consensus Compared to the other dinosaurs in the race MSFT seems to be building a significant advantage Azure with a market share of about in the public cloud space is inching up on AWS which has a share In a recent report I published I commented that Amazon NASDAQ AMZN has some builtin advantages in the race for top dog position in the public cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has some of the same advantages It is and will continue to build very large and very low cost data centers that drive down the costs for what it sells in the cloud But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>also has a huge number of users who are going to migrate to the cloud and would prefer to continue to stay with MSFT as a total solutions provider As I wrote earlier by this time of Microsofts application customers also are buying Azure That is a significant leg up in the race for position in the public cloud market I do not think that anyone can realistically opine on exact comparisons in cloud market share statistics because each company uses different definitions to talk about the same things There is no company with a legacy business that will not have a certain amount of transformational issues It is just my contention that MSFT is handling its own transformation better than most of the legacy vendors and I think that the trend is likely to continue As some observers might point out MSFT has taken some unnatural steps to get its customers signed up for Azure Most MSFT commercial users have enterprise agreements that price all of the products that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>sells Again dating back to MSFT would get users to sign up for the cloud and pay for it by discounting the prices for the other parts of the EA That meant that the company could count the customers Azure users and count the revenue for the commercial cloud That meant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had loads of cloud customers and cloud revenue that was counted even though the users werent actually using the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cloud at all Starting about a year ago that really started to change significantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>significantly tweaked its comp plans such that whats called consumption became very important to sales people and they were assigned a quota for it If sales people were unable to reach consumption quotas they were at danger of losing their bonuses even if their revenue attainment was on quota In some extreme cases MSFTs sales people got fired In all the motivation seems to have done the trick This past quarter the company reported that Azure SQL database usage grew by X on a yearoveryear comparison that is basically part of the metric that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>calls consumption and not revenue dollars As mentioned above CRM seat usage in the cloud trebled I think that it is underappreciated the extent to which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had to chew through a fair amount of Azure credits that had been created when users signed up for the cloud but didnt use what MSFT calls consumption credits How much that might have been will never be known but I think that the current numbers and data points suggest that the company has gotten its customers moving workloads to the cloud and that the customers it is reporting are buying real solutions and are not just the product of marketing hype Overall the cloud attach rate on EAs has reached up from months ago and commercial cloud GM have reached up from in the prior years period I think it is also worth noting that unlike the more recent results of Oracle in particular as well as IBM that overall commercial bookings which include cloud and everything else were up in constant currency I think that in evaluating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>its important to note that the trade between its legacy businesses and cloud is reasonably positive which is currently not the case for either Oracle or IBM and is just barely the case for SAP I think that the message is if you want to play with the dinosaurs this is the dinosaur you ought to be playing with What Is All Of This Regarding TAM Doubling How Can A Mature Company Like This Actually Believe That It Can Double Its TAM Just Based On The Cloud While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hasnt been quite the pioneer when compared to Amazon in the cloud it started to make its investments early enough such that it is enjoying the benefits of a substantially different market structure For example when looking at just the database segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been able to embrace Linux and what is called NoSQL nonrelational databases more effectively when compared to other legacy competitors CEO Satya Nadella described the expansion of the TAM on the ground this way IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because its sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS If youre starting new you will have PaaS which is going to be the first thing you do but then youll always find the need to integrate with something already existing I think another way of looking at the vast increase in the TAM is that Azure is open to run workloads from anyone which includes opensource workloads Linux workloads even Oracle and SAP workloads So Azure and the cloud are adding a new dimension to customers that MSFT can solicit Oracle databases and apps have been completely closed Obviously SAP apps could always run on Oracle databases but with SAPs HANA that was supposed to come to an end Nowadays people are able to use the Azure cloud and move Oracle workloads to that and write new codes to integrate with those apps without reference to ORCL It is a brave new world and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will have a significantly greater market to compete for than it has enjoyed Again to quote CEO Nadella The enterprise is heterogeneous It had been homogeneous We participated only in a portion of it Whereas with Azure we can participate we can participate sic as the total open platform And thats how we think about it and thats what were executing on When the CEO says that the opportunity is the greatest that MSFT has ever enjoyed that is what he is talking about For a long period of time MSFT has been thought of as a traditional value investment with relatively strong cash flow and limited growth opportunity But for the first time in multiple years the company has positioned itself to cash in on a highgrowth market and the early signs of its execution capability are strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>like almost all of the oldline software companies is in the midst of a substantial transition that will take it further and further away from its Windows roots More than all of the companys future growth is going to come from commercial and cloudbased revenues While the headline number of Microsofts public cloud offering Azure shows revenue growth of year on year it is equally important still to look at the growth in commercial bookings which rose in constant currency far greater than modeled by most analysts and yet still an understatement of the actual growth MSFT enjoyed in the space Microsofts reported numbers mask the strong growth its commercial operation is achieving because of both the switch to ratable revenues and the impact sales of cloud applications Unlike some cloudonly companies such as CRM that make the exercise very easy it is hard because of the lack of transparency of the companys financial disclosure to figure out what is actually happening on an apples basis But the same pattern of rising orders that are not reflected in current period revenues is at work for this company as is the case of other significant cloud vendors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>through the years had improved the functionality of its commercial offerings significantly and under the new CEO it has become much more open in terms of how it approaches partnerships with vendors that are notionally competitors The company at least in the Gartner surveys now leads all of the other application vendors in terms of database and analytics It is experiencing a rapid uptake of its cloudbased CRM solution and I imagine that when the balance of its Dynamics ERP product is released in the cloud shortly it will enjoy some significant success in that space as well Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is a relatively old software vendor it has been far more successful with its transition than most of the other older software vendors It has to be sure seen some fall off in some of its legacy offerings but the transition has really been a good trade for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>In answer to a particular question CFO Amy Hood responded Our enterprise workloads across Windows SQL Systems Center etc grew double digit And some of the decline you asked about is in the nonannuity and very transactional business which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has not and probably never will enjoy the type of growth rates associated with pure cloud vendors It has its boat anchor and it is a company in transition But it is enjoying some of the increase in overall volume that is associated with even the strongest of the business application vendors While the company no longer enjoys the deep value metrics it did a few years ago it is on the cusp of seeing accelerated growth in the top line and continued improvement in operating margins as well As the transition to cloud gathers team I think that it will become more and more apparent that Microsofts shares deserve some but of course not all of the valuation metrics that have been achieved by the best of the pure cloud vendors Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
