exclusives show off PS graphic superiority exclusive perks for nonexclusive games MSFT raced out of the gates but muted SNE conference shows investors may have to wait longer for a clearer picture of SNEs holiday strategies On June Sony NYSE SNE found itself in a most unusual position at E having to live up to Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT press conference that threw the mic down with new exclusives and new technologies for PC gamers Under ordinary circumstances this wouldnt be a problem for Sony who only a couple of years ago just had to watch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>trip itself up to win the press conference battle but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was firing on all cylinders and had the gaming world still trying to comprehend the HoloLens by the time Sony took the stage While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>had more hardware and technical offerings Sony wanted to emphasize gameplay with new titles set to be released in late or early Id be more specific with the dates but Sony left that detail off for many of the featured titles The main theme for many of the featured titles was that many were sandbox games with nonlinear stories enabling players to jump around the virtual universe without having to stick to a preset campaign Given the superior graphics engine of the PS sandbox games run very smoothly on the machine so Sony is playing to its strengths with sandbox releases such as No Mans Sky and Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA Mirrors Edge Catalyst which got a strong reception from the audience and seemed like games that could be big sellers when they go on sale later this year Aside from sandbox games Sony unveiled exclusive perks for much anticipated titles when purchased for the PS such as Activisions NASDAQ ATVI Call of Duty Black Ops III which will include a multiplayer beta for the Black Ops universe before the games November launch as well as the full map pack for multiplayer battles Sony also announced that Disney Infinitys NYSE DIS Twilight Republic and Rise Against the Empires playset will be first available on the PS and will likely launch to coincide with the release of Star Wars The Force Awakens sometime this fall With Star Wars as the big draw for Disney and Electronic Arts which remade Star Wars Battlefront and demonstrated the game as it would be played on a PS Sony is clearly looking to position itself as the main console system for Star Wars fans One surprise was that Sony barely touched upon its virtual reality headset Project Morpheus aside from a rundown on how it would function and that it can be demonstrated on the E show floor While it looks impressive and some gamers believe it will have better graphics and functionality than Oculus Rift its inclusion into the press conference seemed like an afterthought at best and a concession to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at worst With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>generating enthusiasm for Oculus Rift before the conference and building upon it during the conference by bringing out its HoloLens augmented reality headset Sony should have had a better response and instead decided to back off Keeping with the trend of the press conference Sony did show off a Morpheusbased game called Rigs which will be a multiplayer virtual esports battlefield title that gives a decent representation of the headsets capabilities but there was little in how it works or a demonstration similar to that of HoloLens which featured how one can play Minecraft with it while playing with someone on a more traditional medium All in all it seemed like a missed opportunity for Sony to show off its own technology and at least temper Microsofts edge for the day Interestingly the more impressive hardware upgrade came from PlayStation Vue Sonys internetbased cable box which announced that it will soon offer a la carte cable channels starting this holiday season rather than microbundles In an age where cordcutting is becoming easier and cable channels are offering streaming subscriptions for those without cable subscriptions Sony appears to be getting ahead of the game with its PS Vue but given that its releasing this at a conference dominated by gaming its likely not going to be a headline grabber despite being a sincere step towards making cordcutting a more practical and realistic means of watching television even if its only offered in a handful of US cities at the moment On its own Sonys conference was pretty good in terms of diversity of game offerings and PS fans have a lot to look forward to with games like Uncharted Final Fantasy VII Remake and The Last Guardian but compared to Microsofts jampacked one that morning it was a little flat by comparison From an investment perspective its a bit difficult to find a serious upside in Sony from this conference Many games that were announced didnt have either a specific release date or a viable range for the games release making it difficult to see what the competition will be for the pivotal holiday shopping season The attitude one might get from the conference is that Sony was caught offguard by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and with PC and console gaming set to merge Sonys position as the dominant gaming company could be in serious jeopardy Investors will likely have to wait for Gamescom later this summer for a more detailed and competitive plan going forward but for now it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>won the day for gamers and gaming investors in the long run Source Did Sony Get Caught Flatfooted At E Disclosure I amwe are long ATVI MoreI wrote
