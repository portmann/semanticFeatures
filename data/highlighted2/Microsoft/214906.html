<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>devices such as Surface Book and Surface Pro are increasingly competitive with Apple However September quarter results contained substantial yy declines in Surface and Windows licensing revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT continues to field very credible Windows devices including the new Surface Pro and Surface Book However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>continues to see declining revenue and market share in what has become the most important personal computing device the smartphone Competing with Apple NASDAQ AAPL has proved challenging and Microsofts September quarter results demonstrate this I cant remember the last time I agreed with anything that exCEO Steve Ballmer had to say Somewhat to my surprise I found myself in agreement with a statement he made in a Bloomberg interview Of course thats not a statement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will be competitive let alone win in any sense of the word But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has an operating system that its been able to adapt to a variety of platforms and that is competitive with Apples Mac OS X and iOS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has demonstrated increasing hardware prowess in conventional Windows devices as well as its very innovative HoloLens system Being competitive doesnt just mean fielding devices Lots of companies put out new smartphones tablets and personal computers Microsofts real challenge in competing with Apple is to achieve comparable profitability Here there is still much work to do as Microsofts September quarter results illustrate On the conference call analysts were generally complementary but the results were mixed GAAP revenue was down yy to billion and GAAP operating income was down yy to billion This was perhaps to be expected as a consequence of the free Windows upgrade but even after putting the Windows deferred revenue of billion back in to the nonGAAP results they werent great Revenue was still down by yy and operating income grew by only yy For the new fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has reorganized into Productivity and Business Processes where Office products went Intelligent Cloud where the enterprise server and cloud Azure products went and then More Personal Computing where all the Windows licensing and devices went <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has always done well in the enterprise and this continues to be the case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has put all its problem children in one playpen and the result was a yy decline in revenue for the More Personal Computing MPC group As Ive been saying for some time Windows is not stimulating growth in Window OEM devices and OEM licensing revenue was down yy for pro licensing and down yy for consumer One analyst pointed to this as a better than expected result but it really isnt OEMs generally buy a lot of licenses when a new version of Windows comes out in preparation for new hardware releases It doesnt say anything about sales except that they dont expect them to be any better than last year when Windows had already been out for a year Surface revenue was also down yy but it was phone hardware that suffered the worst decline of yy Search was the the sole bright spot in the new group posting a yy revenue gain on the strength of enhanced search demand through new Windows users CEO Nadella has made some good decisions in trying to meet the challenges faced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in devices Making the Windows upgrade free to consumers was a good decision Microsofts latest Surface devices are very competitive and can be expected to do well Probably the best decision made at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is the one most at odds with Apples approach which was to focus on a single converged OS with variants for the different device types Im sure this is the right approach despite being an Apple investor and developer As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>and its OEMs have fielded a variety of Windowsbased Intel NASDAQ INTC powered touch screen laptops and tablets this has probably hurt iPad sales more than anything else But its been a validation of Microsofts approach and continues to be an advantage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Microsofts big problem is in smartphones I doubt the new Windows phones can turn this around The hardware is commodity grade with undistinguished Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM processors Im not convinced that the Continuum feature that allows the phone to be used in desktop mode is a really compelling usage scenario for most consumers especially traditional Windows users who probably already have a Windows PC None of the usual Windows PC software will run on these phones If smartphones represent a gap in Microsofts device strategy there is another deeper gap This is Microsofts dependence on commodity processors from Intel and Qualcomm Focusing on Intel for laptops and tablets is a good strategy for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the near term Microsofts priority needed to be preserving its existing billion user base and converting them to more mobile devices as I discussed in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Mobilizes the PC Providing backward compatibility to legacy Windows software was key to this The lack of ability to develop custom SOCs for its phones more or less dooms them to second tier status This lack of a custom SOC also doomed Microsofts early ARMbased Surface tablets Relying on commodity ARM processors has never worked well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Given Apples fiveyear head start in custom SOCs this is a lead that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cannot reasonably expect to overcome without help Probably Microsofts best choice is to rely on Intel for smartphone processors once processors of sufficient performance become available So the all Intel future still looks like the best path forward in the near term Continuum running on an Intelbased phone probably opens up a wider range of software options for the user Whether this is enough to kick start Windows phone sales remains to be seen It cant hurt Lately Ive begun to wonder if the all Intel approach is really the best for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>in the very long term Ive been saying for some time that the only advantage that ARM processors have over the Intel architecture is cost While this cost advantage has proved decisive for smartphones and most lower cost tablets the extra cost of Wintel devices is acceptable for the sake of software compatibility In the longer term I wonder if there wont be a gradual erosion of the Windows user base as users are lured away by lower cost ARMbased platforms As I and many others are observing ARM processors are getting much more capable every year At the rate of current progress ARM processors from leading developers such as Apple and Samsung will probably be equivalent to all but the most powerful processors from Intel in a year or two The popularity of Windows is probably to some degree generational and younger users starting out on one of the mobile device platforms will not be motivated by considerations of compatibility with Windows software Windows may eventually lose more users due to old age than for any other reason But this is a few years off For the present
