artificial intelligence Apple has shown that it can come from behind in AI as it did in mobile processors through acquisitions and RD Apple can exploit synergies through its control of both processor and OS development to field the most compelling mobile AI service Apples NASDAQ AAPL acquisition of Turi bolsters its capabilities in machine learning and AI Apple is following the same pattern it did in acquiring expertise in processor design which thrust it into a position of leadership in mobile processors within a few years Apple will pursue leadership in AI with equal vigor because AI is the ultimate killer app I had the opportunity to participate in a podcast interview recently with fellow SA contributor Brian Bain which should be coming out this week During the interview I brought up the fact that I expected one of the most significant innovations in the upcoming iPhone to be in the processor I made the point that processor innovation is often ignored in media coverage of rumors concerning the next iPhone Brian questioned whether consumers really care about the details of processor technology and I had to concede that they most probably dont Its a fundamental problem for Apple how to translate its processor leadership into tangible benefits that consumers care about Sure the processor helps everything work a little better but its not an obvious feature the way an OLED screen is At the same time Apple has been roundly criticized for falling behind its competitors in AI and machine learning Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Google Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT all have much more robust and useful AI capability baked into their platforms as I pointed out recently SA contributor BayesianLearner has also criticized Apples AI efforts but wrote a very positive and informative take on the Turi acquisition Apple did not just buy some algorithms or a team it bought a platform that can be used as the basis for future machinelearning services Indeed perhaps the most significant aspect of Turis offerings is that it advertises that its solutions are highly scalable from individual devices to cloud platforms And if it seems implausible that AI could be hosted on a smartphone keep in mind that Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM recently announced a software development kit SDK to provide AI and machine learning on its Snapdragon processor Turi is just the latest in a string of acquisitions by Apple of companies with expertise or products related to AI These include the purchase last October of VocalIQ a UK startup specializing in natural speech recognition and Perceptio specializing in image recognition Perceptio is especially interesting in this context because Perceptios goals were to implement its algorithms on smartphones according to Bloomberg In January Apple acquired Emotient specializing in facial expression recognition Clearly Apples ongoing interest in preserving the privacy of its customers combined with its own processor expertise make localized AI a natural offering To some degree Apples AI services will have to be distributed between individual devices and its cloud services Search maps and AI based recommendations all necessarily have to be cloud based But localized AI gives Apples powerful mobile processors a raison detre that perhaps they have lacked until now Apples position in AI reminds me of where it was in mobile processors prior to Despite the growing popularity of iPhone and iPod Apple was still buying the processors for these devices from Samsung OTCSSNLF in much the same way it buys processors for the Mac from Intel NASDAQ INTC That started to change in when Apple introduced its own custom designed A system on chip SOC for the first iPad Apples claim of designing the A has to be taken with a grain of salt however Apple was in effect serving as a silicon system integrator in much the same role as it is a system integrator of components for its Macs Apples design role for the A was confined mostly to selecting and integrating other companies designs It bought graphics processor designs from Imagination Technologies and it used a CPU core designed by a small startup Intrinsity Samsung served as the foundry for the part At the same time Apple had been building its own design capabilities It had bought PA Semi in and then in it bought Intrinsity which had supplied the A CPU core design to Samsung for use in a Samsung mobile processor as well as the A From that base through rapid hiring and RD expansion Apple moved through a succession of A series SOCs until its first bit custom processor the A which debuted in late with the iPhone s The A was a watershed event Not only had Apple completely taken over the design of the CPU core it had produced the worlds first bit smartphone processor The A was faster than any competing smartphone processor and sent the industry reeling Today almost every high and midtier smartphone uses a bit processor because theyre just much faster than the older generation bit devices As revolutionary as the A was it didnt particularly help iPhone sales since it was introduced into an S model year It wasnt until the iPhone and its larger screen that Apples processor expertise was really put to good use Apple didnt just make a phablet it made a phablet that was fast and fluid that didnt hitch while scrolling that could run apps and play games with high performance and excellent battery life Now that large screens have become the norm mixed localcloud based AI provides a natural way to translate Apples processor leadership into tangible consumer benefits Apple will be able to offer powerful AI services with the best privacy protection in the business Will Apple be able to progress as rapidly in AI services as it did in processor design I think so It took Apple about years to go from the PA Semi acquisition to the A It will probably take Apple about years to go from the Turi acquisition to leadership in AI Over that interval Apples AI capabilities will continue to improve with each new OS generation all platforms One of the key discriminators for Apple is that it controls its processor design its device design and its operating systems design No other of Apples competitors has control over all three areas There are synergies to be had as a result that make Apples products superior in ease of use and reliability AI functionality is going to become another crucial area of synergy for Apple and Apple most likely will achieve a leadership position as a result I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a year investment horizon Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am
