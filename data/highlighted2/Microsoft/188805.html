synthetically create the equivalent of a master limited partnership MLP called iNewCorp with Kinder Morgans financial profile from scratch with effectively no capital at all Well address the rumor mill by showing how the oil and gas pipeline industry is not covering its dividend and distribution payments with traditional free cash flow a valuation term Well also explain how valuation techniques cannot ignore growth capital in the valuation equation of MLPs AMLP or other midstream corporates The primary goal of this piece is to reveal how warped the financial engineering has become with respect to MLPs especially in the context of the valuations placed on them For background on this topic please read Reasons Why Kinder Morgan Will Collapse and More Reasons Why Kinder Morgan Will Collapse In this article we will synthetically create the equivalent of a master limited partnership MLP called iNewCorp with Kinder Morgans financial profile from scratch with effectively no capital at all with only a strong credit rating In such an example well also explain how valuation techniques cannot ignore growth capital in the valuation equation of MLPs NYSEARCA AMLP or other midstream corporates by pricing them on a multiple of distributable cash flow or on the dividenddistribution that follows it Well do so by contemplating the value of a company that has a distributable cash flow stream requiring maintenance andor growth capex versus one with the same distributable cash flow stream not requiring any maintenance andor growth capex First however well address the rumor mill by showing how the oil and gas pipeline industry is not covering its dividend and distribution payments with traditional free cash flow a valuation term which differs from the industrys definition of distributable cash flow a contractual termnot one to be used in valuing equities or at least in the context of how some are using it The primary goal of this piece however is to reveal how warped the financial engineering has become with respect to MLPs especially in the context of the valuations placed on them When one sees how easily other corporates such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Cisco NASDAQ CSCO or Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM or any other entity with excess cash and a strong credit rating can create a shell conduit that is priced on a contractual passthrough to shareholders or the substance of the distribution passthrough to unitholders of an MLP for example either one of two things may happen every capable company will or should create cashflowbacked shell companies to artificially generate value at the parent consequences unknown or the MLP business model will be restrained or dissolved in time In the example to follow well show how an investmentgrade company with essentially no investment or ongoing commitment at all can generate billion in incremental equity value to the tune of the equivalent of the entire enterprise value of Kinder Morgan NYSE KMI at the time the example was originally developed Given the recent controversial contractual passthrough structure of Alibaba NYSE BABA for example we wouldnt be surprised that if board rooms in other sectors namely technology knew how easily value could be generated in the following way wed see cashflowbacked shell companies expand in number just the same as the MLP model has proliferated across the energy complex in the US The Shocking Truth About the Free Cash Flow Shortfall and Debt Bubble Most master limited partnerships and midstream corporates do not generate enough traditional free cash flow to cover their cash distributions and dividends Anything to the contrary is categorically false A look at traditional free cash flow generation as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending after distributionsdividends for a select but large and representative group of upstream and pipeline MLP plays shows a massive shortfall The select group of entities in the table at the top of this article both upstream and midstream had an aggregate billion free cash flow shortfall relative to cash dividends paid during the first half of as they collectively held a staggering billion in net debt at the end of the second quarter of thats nearly a quarter trillion dollars The idea that such financial profiles can possibly translate into a view that their dividendsdistributions are safe is hard to believe Whats more how some of the debt from entities in this group can be considered investmentgrade by the rating agencies when such entities have been unable to generate operating cash flow in excess of total capital spending and the dividenddistribution and in light of their junkequivalent net debt to adjusted EBITDA levels is even harder to believe It may be the nature of the MLP business model that Is causing this ominous dynamic but it may not be but it may not matter either A corporate not MLP Kinder Morgan for one has the choice to finance all of its capital expenditures with internallygenerated cash flow from operations and forgo the current level of its dividend as most corporates do but it doesnt Instead Kinder Morgan accesses the debt and equity markets not for funds related to capex because we argue it already has them the firm has already generated them in cash flow from operations but because it wants to keep paying and growing a dividend Theres nothing wrong with this per se unless of course investors are led to believe that the dividend is organicallyderived like those of other corporates which pay out their dividends as a percentage of earnings andor traditional free cash flow In Kinder Morgan will pay out twice as much in cash dividends than it will generate in earnings and possibly four times as much in dividends as it will generate in traditional free cash flow From our perspective and Kinder Morgans activity sheds light on this executive teams across the MLP space are also in substance accessing the equity and debt markets as a way to fund distributions and in our view conveniently using the MLP structure as a way to do so helping to facilitate a debtinfused dividendbased equity pricing paradigm It doesnt matter if this is how MLPs work or not this is whats happening at the core Internallygenerated capital is always the lowest cost of capital and that it is not being used as the primary source of investment for growth even for a corporate pipeline operator which has as much flexibility as any other corporate is a significant red flag at the very least Investors should continue to be concerned about debtinfused dividendsdistributions and the equity pricing structure that surrounds them Understanding the Financial Engineering of MLPs and Why Traditional MLP Valuation Techniques Should Not Omit Growth Capex The following example is purely hypothetical and for educational purposes only but lets explain for example how Applea balancesheet cashrich entitycan effectively financially engineer a completely new entity that has Kinder Morgans current financial profile or create billion in incremental equity value or more using less than of Apples current balance sheet or arguably with nothing at all Note Kinder Morgan had been trading at a higher price level when this example was first developed so its marketrelated information is not current First lets cover some financials Kinder Morgan the largest energy infrastructure company in North America is on pace to generate billion in distributable cash flow in Traditional free cash flow however will be substantially less than distributable cash flow during the year given growth capital investments that are necessary to drive future increases in net income a component of future distributable cash flow This is a very important point that will be critical later in this example Lets assume that Kinder Morgans distributable cash flow will advance at a clip over the next few years in line with managements expectation for the pace of dividend growth over the same time frame Kinder Morgans enterprise value is currently billion consisting of about billion in equity and billion in debt at the time the example had been written Apple holds over billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of June For illustration purposes lets have Apple create a corporation called iNewCorp in which it sets up a partnership agreement by which Apple contributes billion more or less in cash to iNewCorp per annum in exchange for ownership of iNewCorp The agreement stipulates no minimum distributablecashflow to dividendspaid ratio meaning that dividends can exceed Apples cash contributions at any time which equivalently happens periodically across the masterlimitedpartnership arena when distributions exceed distributable cash flow in certain periods From a baseline of billion lets also assume that iNewCorp plans to increase dividends to its future shareholders by each year through and by a morereasonable growth rate after that The initial billion startup obligation could easily be covered by Apple an entity with billion on the books and one that has generated billion in cash flow from operations during the nine months ending June Apple can cover the initial billion obligation times over with cash on the balance sheet and times over with ninemonthsworth of cash from operations Lets now assume that Apple guarantees iNewCorps growing dividend stream and any and all of iNewCorps debts thereby giving iNewCorp an investmentgrade credit rating With such an investmentgrade rating iNewCorp then borrows billion against the future cash flow stream that is implicitly backed by Apple coincidentally approximating Kinder Morgans debt outstanding If you think this is good thus far it gets better iNewCorp then uses this billion in newlyraised debt to backstop its very own future dividend payments to its very own future shareholders With the newlyraised debt alone iNewCorp would then be able to cover growing dividends to its future shareholders for years depending on the growth rate without any future Apple cash contributions iNewCorp can now raise equity on the open market such that with its newlyraised debt the corporate is now able to fund its entire growing dividend stream via external capitalraising efforts maybe on a equitydebt split if it wants to Said differently iNewCorp can fund its entire future and growing dividend stream purely from financing activities Under this scenario to sustain iNewCorps dividend Apple itself would not have to pay any more ongoing cash to iNewCorp after the initial billion outlay Since there is no minimum distributablecashflow to dividendspaid mandate within this particular partnership agreement Apple would only have to stand as a backdrop and guarantee the newlycreated entitys future dividends and debt load The external financing markets are sustaining the dividend What Apple has done in this example is financially engineer the future dividend stream and capital structure of a new Kinder Morgan which we have called iNewCorp and it has done so with effectively no capital at all Apple is just standing behind iNewCorp reinforcing its investmentgrade borrowing capacity which supports the dividend that supports the equity price which provides incremental equity capital that can also be used to support iNewCorps dividend and so on On the basis of the current enterprise value of the actual Kinder Morgan iNewCorp should theoretically fetch an enterprise value of at least billion or it was at the time which would be all equity in iNewCorps case until borrowings are distributed to iNewCorps shareholders as dividends If dividends should happen to be paid directly from newlyissued equity then theres no reason to believe iNewCorps equity wouldnt hold a billion equity price all else equal at least in this market Theres more that meets the eye however and this is where it becomes clear that growth capital cannot be ignored in the valuation of oil and gas pipeline entities Please note that given recent changes in the market price Kinder Morgans pricetodistributable cash flow ratio has fallen significantly from noted levels below Kinder Morgan has been trading at a price to distributable cash flow ratio of times a distribution yield or it had at the time and some may argue the enterprise value and equity market capitalization of iNewCorp should theoretically be higher than Kinder Morgans After all Kinder Morgan requires maintenance and growth capital to fuel future net income and dividend growth and has exposure to commodity price shifts and other operating risks while iNewCorp does not Apples newlycreated corporation is pure and growing cash In our view however iNewCorp should be the one to fetch a times pricetodistributable multiple distribution yield while Kinder Morgans pricetodistributable cash flow ratio should be substantially lower given commodity and operating risks as well as the maintenance capex and massive growth capex that is required to drive future net income expansion They both cant have the same pricetodistributable cash flow ratios just because their distributable cash flow is the sameone requires significant cash outflows to sustain the payout while the other requires none In the example of iNewCorp valuing different equities with varying growth capital outlays and commodityoperating risks on a standardized pricetodistributable cash flow ratio is fraught with inconsistencies and imbalances Furthermore in this hypothetical example with less than of its balance sheet or with perhaps nothing at all Apple has created in iNewCorp billion in incremental equity value or a boost to Apples entire market capitalization Apple would have received the proceeds from the IPO of iNewCorp or retained an ownership stake Thats certainly a needlemover for one of the largest companies in the world One may even say that Apple can easily cover an arrangement like this many times over If you believe in the financial engineering above then theoretically Apple can create trillions of equity capitalization repeating this over and over again Apples balance sheet and cash flow generation are assets much like the pipelines in the ground are assets There is a very good reason in our view why dividends should be paid out of traditional free cash flow cash from operations less all capital spending or earnings as anything else is textbook financial engineering and arguably misleading to the individual investor that believes all dividendsdistributions are created equal which they are not Were sticking with companies that have organicallyderived dividends and
