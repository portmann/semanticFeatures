NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has decided to indefinitely postpone its Project Astoria or Windows Bridge for Android program Project Astoria was supposed to help Android developers quickly port their apps to the Windows app store Sales of Windows phones are unlikely to improve if the Windows mobile app store continues to have fewer apps than the Google Play Store Sources of WindowsCentral said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT is indefinitely postponing Project Astoria or Windows Bridge for Android WindowsCentral might be on the money with this rumor because even the website for Windows Bridge for Android is no longer active at Microsofts site Project Astoria was supposed to be the magic pill from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that would encourage developers to port current Android apps to the Windows Mobile app store With the indefinite postponement of Project Astoria there is very slim chance that Android app developers will help grow the Windows Mobile app store Sales of Windows Phones have struggled largely due to the face that fewer apps available for them relative to Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Play and Apples NASDAQ AAPL App Store The indefinite suspension of the Project Astoria program is therefore another setback for Microsofts overall mobile campaign Investors should not count on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to sell more phones because its promise of Android apps compatibility for Windows phones is not going to happen anytime soon The substantially lower number of apps available for Windows handsets compared to iOSAndroid phones will again limit future sales of Windows phones Without more successful Android apps and games being ported to the Windows Mobile app store the Lumia division will likely continue to be a moneylosing venture Consequently as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>cannot build a bigger user base of Windows mobile users advertisers will continue to ignore Bing in favor of Alphabets mobile search engine Furthermore the original July Windows Bridge for Android SDK allow developers to easily replace Googles AdMob API with Microsofts Ads in Apps service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>urgently needs more mobile apps to attract more buyers for Windows devices Consequently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs more Windows Phone users to attract advertisers Microsofts freemium strategy for mobile is not going to happen if it cannot build a robust ecosystem for its own mobile advertising services Alphabets free giveaway of the Android OS and other mobile apps was a profitable decision precisely because it was able to grow its mobile search and appsbased advertising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors has every right to get discouraged over Project Astorias indefinite postponement There is a huge opportunity in the app store business The mobile games industry alone was estimated to generate sales of over billion this year After the cancellation of Project Astoria <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is unlikely to get a Windows Mobile port of among others the millionday Clash of Clans Android game Without a robust Windows app store the multibillion app store business will remain a duopoly between Alphabet and Apple Microsofts targeted attempt to win the support of Android app developers with Project Astoria was a great decision Android apps are now emerging as strong cash generators Having successful Android apps ported via Project Astoria to Windows Mobile could have substantially helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>grow its own app store business Apple and Google gets cut from that billionyear from gamesrelated app purchases Pushing through with Project Astoria could have been an easy way to benefit from the popularity of Android apps Once Alphabets special Play Store for China gets operational the global Android mobile platform could really generate more global sales than iOS devices As of now App Annies chart below only calculates the global app revenue generated by the official Google Play Store App Annies claim that Apples App Store generates more sales than Android is because Apple operates an official app store in China which is counted by App Annie As per a DigiCapital report Android apps actually generate more sales than iOS apps when sales from Chinas numerous Android app stores are included The original design of Project Astoria was to let developers use their existing APK Android Application Package for Windows Mobile devices Windows Bridge for AndroidProject Astorias Software Development Kit allows Android developers to quickly replace the Google Mobile Services Application Mobile Interfaces APIs with Microsofts own mobile services APIs Replacing the APIs was necessary to make sure these Android apps will process inapp purchases only through the Windows app store Unfortunately illegally distributed developersonly copies of the SDK allowed ordinary but techsavvy Lumia users to actually sideload Android games APKs on their Windows phones This abuse of the Project Astoria SDK also allowed direct inapp purchases from the Google Play Store using Lumia phones The indefinite postponement is therefore only logical <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>will be the laughingstock of the tech industry if it allows Windows phones to be used for direct inapp purchases from Alphabets app store <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>still needs more time to fix the exploits that allowed nondevelopers to use the Project Astoria SDK Project Astoria was very important feature toward attracting more buyers for Windows mobile phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>now has a more difficult path toward building a competent mobile app store Without Project Astoria sales of Windows mobile phones will again be burdened by fewer apps available for them I expect Microsofts Bing and Ads in Apps services to also continue to struggle against Googles dominant presence We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
