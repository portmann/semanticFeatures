opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Apple has announced record breaking iOS App Store revenue for calendar and the December holiday season Surpassing last years December records indicates that iPhone sales growth continues to be strong Even as Apple NASDAQ AAPL investors have been inundated with negative supply chain reports and downgrades from analysts Apple has released real data indicating strong iPhone sales growth in December quarter Traditionally strong iOS device sales in the December quarter have translated into strong app sales in the days following Christmas and New Years Last years app sales set new records and served as a harbinger of impressive December quarter iPhone sales This year Apple has announced that app downloads again broke last years records This bodes very well for the fiscal Q earnings report and beyond With all the various supply chain rumors being floated I try to focus investor attention on reliable factual data and continue to point to Apple as the best source of data about Apple The app sales announcement is important because the peak of app sales typically corresponds to strong iPhone sales during the December quarter When someone gets a new iPhone whether for the first time or an upgrade the first thing they want to do is load up on apps or upgrade their apps to run under the latest iOS version So the surge in app purchases represents a fairly reliable barometer of iPhone sales at least in a qualitative sense App sales have been very strong all during calendar with over billion in gross revenue being generated according to the SVP of Marketing Phil Schiller This represents a yy increase compared to the roughly billion Apple reported for the App Store this time last year In addition to the overall performance for the year Apple announced that it had broken the previous years sales records for single day sales set on New Years Day with over million in gross revenue generated in a single day Apple also had gross revenue for the two weeks ending January of billion setting new backtoback weekly records in the process This real data flies in the face of the negative narrative of declining iPhone sales momentum Apple also reported the research of Dr Michael Mandel who estimates that Apples app economy has generated million jobs in the US million jobs in Europe and million jobs in China That kind of job creation is an endorsement of the future prospects for iOS app developers The report from Japans Nikkei is just the latest supply chain rumor Why are supply chain rumors becoming so predominant as we approach Apples December quarterly report on January As I and many others have pointed out CEO Tim Cook specifically cautioned investors against drawing conclusions from such rumors I believe that the answer lies in the denouement of the September quarter report As the reader may recall prior to Apples September quarter report anxiety about Apple was driven primarily by what was supposedly happening in China The slowdown in China would supposedly hurt Apple which had become too dependent on iPhone sales in China Apples September earnings report which I reviewed made it clear that the dire predictions about China were largely fabrication Yes there had been some slowing of growth in China but it hadnt become actual economic contraction and Apple hadnt been hurt in any case Apples revenue in China grew by almost yy With China no longer a viable pretext for the negative narrative a new pretext had to be found and supply chain rumors fit the bill nicely Most of the rumors sound terrible but are more or less meaningless when analyzed rigorously The Nikkei rumor is a case in point The article reports Apple is expected to reduce output of its latest iPhone models by around in the JanuaryMarch quarter compared with its original plans according to several parts suppliers The measure will deal a blow to Japanese and South Korean parts companies What were Apples original plans We have no idea Without that critical piece of data theres simply no way to interpret the number even if it is accurate which I doubt Im not the only one who is doubtful about the rumors Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray has also expressed his skepticism about the rumors as reported by Apple Insider If the rumors are just nonsense why doesnt Apple simply make an announcement setting the record straight Ive often read complaints to that effect from investors Certainly Apple could do that However I think it would be illadvised Apple is already the most transparent of the large technology companies reporting specific unit shipments for each of its product categories which its large competitors such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Samsung OTCSSNLF do not For Apple to disclose its specific sales forecasts for the coming quarter would be unprecedented and potentially provide some strategic advantage to its competitors One possibility is that the negative supply chain rumors are an attempt to flush out just such a disclosure from Apple If thats the case so far Apple isnt falling for it Ill frankly admit that I cant disprove the supply chain rumors They could be true but as Daniel Eran Dilger has pointed out the history of such rumors doesnt lend them any credibility My opinion is that this is just China all over again When Apple issues its guidance for the March quarter investors will have a much more reliable take on expectations for the quarter than any supply chain rumors can provide I recommend investors withhold judgment until then In the meantime I continue to stand by my rating of Apple as a buy In fact at its current price its probably a bargain Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange
