<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was growing stronger after years of being left in the dust by both Apple and a new generation of Silicon Valley power players the folks at Goldman Sachs GS remained bearish on good old MSFT But now Goldman has realized the errors of its ways and in a research note entitled Righting a Wrong is telling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>hoping that Hello its Goldman and asking if after all these years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would like to meet to go over everything We downgraded <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to Sell on April on the premise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>facedcritical secular challenges given

#A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that its sorry for breaking its stock We are raising our month price target from to equal weightedDCF PE EVFCF due to higher out year estimates better visibility into thecloud businesses and the expectation of continued solid execution At MSFT trades at x our CYE EPS of consensus But before the guys at West Street ask the folks at <span style='background-color:
