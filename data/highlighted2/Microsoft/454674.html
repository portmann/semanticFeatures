class='textDiv'>Fitbit IntraQuarter Update Fitbit Inc NYSEFIT Seeking Alpha Shares of Fitbit may have bottomed if not only temporarily Competition is a perceived threat that has yet to be validated as a real threat If Ive said it once Ive said it a thousand times Fitbit NYSE FIT shares will not achieve the typical growth multiple assigned to many hiflyer stocks with like growth characteristics The reason for this forecast and proven valuation is very much aligned with Fitbit maintaining all the characteristics of a hardware vendor Nothing more and nothing less We can assign reasons for the stock not living up to its potential and in great multitudes but the underlying reason will always concern Fitbit being a hardwarecentric company And as far as being a hardware company history has taught us that the business is one of seeking out markets for distribution and then saturating those markets Upon achieving this goal growth inevitably evaporates with sales declining and gross profit margins contracting Its not a matter of whether it will happen to Fitbit but rather when it will happen to Fitbit That is of course unless youve seen the company exhibit an ability to broaden its product portfolio beyond fitness trackers and smart fitness devices No Ok then lets move forward While the stock has underperformed and sold off since reporting Q results shares have seemingly bottomed at least for the time being and as we head into another earnings season Shares of FIT hit another alltime low during the Brexit panic and I recently had the chance to lower my cost average on my long position and as offered via my Twitter feed Since starting this latest trading round with FIT equity at roughly post Q results Ive been able to lower my cost average considerably to where it resides now at just a share I dont have a reasonable amount of fear in holding shares of FIT presently as the value is quite considerable even for a hardware company If we look at the recent trading valuation for a similar hardware company like GoPro NASDAQ GPRO which will exhibit declines in all major metrics including sales and earnings FITs present valuation at roughly times expected FY earnings suggests something is amiss with the way investors are participating in the stock Having said that we have to consider the history of hardware valuations that is irrespective of growth But Ill take the risk given that I believe the company will exceed Q expectations and begin trading at a forward PE instead of a trailing PE Having said all of that lets talk about the company and the mythological threat of competition Weekly if not every other day there are the hopeless as defined by Fitbit garnering of Q wearable sales ramblings of competition I define these ramblings as little more than fearmongering without justification or validity There are literally hundreds of companies having developed developing andor deploying fitness trackers and wearables into the marketplace that fall upon deaf ears As such its not so much whether or not you can accomplish those tasks but rather whether you can get on the shelf and in front of consumers Some of wearable devices that launch will never see the light of day in a retail environment The reasons for this are many but most importantly because they have come to the market far too late and without the capital to participate alongside other vendors This declaration is presented to big and small companies alike The examples are too numerous but have been presented very identifiably with Under Armours NYSE UA HealthBox As I detailed in the publication Under Armour Fitbit And The Wearables Market Potential Under Deeper Analysis the company will never find a return on the more than million it invested into the wearables category Having spent over to participate in the fitness tracker and wearables segment to date I believe the company has spent a good deal of money in error and under presumed notions of future growth With regard to Under Armours HealthBox product line that first debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show back in January the product is only now hitting Europe Since first launching in North America the distribution for the product line has largely fallen well short of expectations especially those that forecasted the product competing with Fitbit products Its just so bad for Under Armour and its participation in the category Analysts in the category never bring up their name and relative search strength for the devices is among the lowest of vendors participating in the wearables category If one searches through the fitness tracker category ranking on Amazon NASDAQ AMZN for HealthBox products the product doesnt even rank in the top So when I said Under Armour spent millions in error the only question to build upon that declaration is what will the writedowns look like for the company when they come Do you remember how much of a threat HealthBox was supposed to be for Fitbit Do you remember seeing the advertisements for the product line Maybe you recall seeing it at Dicks Sporting Goods NYSE DKS and not much anywhere else With all this forced nostalgic thinking all I can recollect is one of my longtime favorite songs from Phil Collins titled Do You Remember from the s So much for HealthBox Im done with that threat I would ramble on about the proposed threat from Apple Watch NASDAQ AAPL but over the last several months I think my articles regarding the Apple Watch and its laundry list of failures speak to its underperformance To color the threat that was perceived to be from the Apple Watch on Fitbit Id rather offer what its next iteration will employ and deploy As I stated suggested and sampled previously the Apple Watch has failed to generate anything meaningful beyond distribution As such sales for the Apple Watch have fallen precipitously after just one year Secondly the Apple Watch has found that the greater utility for such a smart device will come from its health and wellness features and not all those duplicate features found in a smartphone Thirdly as I suggested previously the next iteration of the Apple Watch will be aligned more greatly to be used as a smart fitness device Most unfortunately however the Apple Watch OS will still not be able to compete on par with Fitbit Price points will still be too high and overall functionality will still be found wanting for greater market penetration regardless of the improvements to the device Apple has never lead itself into a product category with its worst foot forward and in the case of Apple Watch that is exactly what it did As such the already few millions of users will not likely give the product another chance on top of those that will never give it a chance due to the price point and utility of the device What I find comical about those suggesting that the Apple Watch doesnt compete directly with Fitbit is that Fitbit itself states openly it competes against Apple in its annual filing Funny how some media pundits like to align a narrative to fit a personal belief system even when the evidence is very much to the contrary and Apple moves in a more direct competitive position Maybe they believe Fitbit is lying but where is the litigation against the company for that There has been and resides a primary fault with the smartwatch subcategory since when the smartwatch devices launched The problem was that they did far less than a smartphone at an aggressive added cost to the consumer Since that problem has not been addressed and based on every single data point that is presented with new iterations the problem will persist This is identified with Apple essentially reducing its production output for the fall launch of the Apple Watch OS on a launchoverlaunch basis Even Apple is forced to recognize the company didnt see the sellthrough demand it had expected with the first Apple Watch and is forced to focus on profitability with the Apple Watch OS Most of the Apple Watch sales came in the first months of sales and an estimated million have sold into the market for all of Unfortunately the sellthrough has failed to generate new orders in which will now find with the launch of Watch OS still a likely decline in Watch sales for as forecasted by many analysts including MingChi of KGI Securities Apple is only ramping production for the Watch OS to roughly million units monthly Apple Watch shipments will decline more than percent yearoveryear in comparison to according to a new research note issued by KGI Securities analyst MingChi Kuo The wearable device sold an estimated million units in eight months last year but Kuo predicts that even with the launch of the Apple Watch and a full twelve months of sales the devices shipments will still come in at less than million units in Whether it is Samsung Apple Garmin NASDAQ GRMN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT or whomever try as they may to compete it is an effort in vain Fitbit will remain in the dominant position for the totality of the wearables category So it has been said so it has been written Tongue and cheek as it may be offered the reasoning is identifiable exampled and has been proven most relevant within the statistical findings as evidenced in the chart from Stackline below In yet another photograph below the far left examples different wearable products fighting for space in a foot section of the store The Samsung Gear Fit and Gear S smartwatch have about of selling space within that foot section and alongside the Garmin Vivo products The far right portion of the photograph examples the foot Fitbit section of the store Firstmover advantage branding and the general term used by wearable consumers is identified by how retailers are positioning wearable products in their stores and on the shelves The statistical data is irrefutable Fitbit faces competition But it likely wont falter due to competition as evidenced by the statistical and physical data The company will be just fine its investors who should consider something greater and that something greater is their investment Investors have to worry more presciently about sales growth deceleration in an increasingly saturated wearables space Anecdotally speaking years ago I told a good friend who was offered a vice presidents role at The Sports Authority that his career would be shortlived I showed him a simple graphic akin to the one that is updated below regarding the market share gains by Amazon with respect to sporting good sales and The Sports Authority Fortunately my friend understood the irreversible trend in the business and avoided The Sports Authority which eventually filed for bankruptcy In short statistics dont lie and trends are hard to overcome As such what Fitbit has garnered in the way of market share will likely not be overcome or impeded at this stage of the race Moreover and most importantly for FIT investor consideration is Fitbits continued distribution and selling practices Almost a month ago the company proliferated a Todays Special Value segment on the Home Shopping Network HSN Fitbit sold Alta units at a discounted price that likely showed little if any gross profit margins On Saturday it followed this distribution and selling practice with a QVC Network Todays Special Value for the Blaze smart fitness watch Fitbit sold units during the allday promotion As with the prior Home Shopping Network promotional sale the latest QVC promotional sale will hinder brickandmortar sellthrough results and prove to be an impediment for YOY sales come for Fitbit Again by and large analysts dont follow the home shopping sales channels and dont account for the impact on sales from these channels be they favorable or negative Due to the lack of coverage regarding the home shopping channels analyst sales data tracking becomes less viable and less effective At present I believe Fitbit is overinventorying its retail partners given the breadth of participation in the home shopping channel I had warned of this occurrence previously on June rd and identified it with retail channel checks that included Target NYSE TGT and Best Buy NYSE BBY With the company launching new versions of the Charge HR and Flex fitness trackers during Q I believe it will focus more on sellthrough for much of the back half of Production cuts will be needed to alleviate retail inventory levels and sellthrough will have to increase in order for the company to come out of the Q holiday selling period with clean inventories While the tone is understandably cautious it is in fitting with the share price valuation and as such justified Furthermore I believe sales have accelerated in Q for international markets that will serve to offset further YOY sales growth deceleration in the Americas With this data point it is reasonable to expect Q sales to have performed well for Fitbit during the period and on a YOY basis Gross profit margins are likely stable for the period and the average selling price has moved little month to month But even with all that being said guidance investors will key off of guidance and as usual If you have followed my CPG and retail coverage over the years on Seeking Alpha you likely have born witness to profits issued with my investments and trades In I have offered additional trading and investment opportunities for which I have recently closed out profitable trades in TWTR JCP UVXY and as of last week SBUX at for a lesser return Additionally last week our longstanding price target of a share on PepsiCo NYSE PEP has been achieved I have traded FIT positively times already this year with the most recent still in play My returns on invested capital to date are roughly and coming off of a plus return in For those who consistently follow my UVXY short narratives and analysis it is well understood that my largest portfolio position has remained with the ETF since Shares of UVXY are down roughly YTD and continue to generate great wealth for longterm short participants and since the ETF came to the market in late In the coming days I will deliver more updated trading and investment opportunities as I also participate in at least onepenny stock annually that exhibits strong fundamentals with a deep value If you have enjoyed my publications and are looking for additional analysis and insights please feel free to follow me on Seeking Alpha in real time and on Twitter I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Additional disclosure I maintain a significant short position in shares of UVXY at all times with a small long position to garner tax losses For this reason I have also reduced my short position in shares of UVXY earlier this year Tagged Investing
