dont doubt that Apples growth will slow from here on out Apple NASDAQ AAPL is too cheap is something youll hear repeated pretty often on Seeking Alpha and probably any other investment research forum In tandem with this oftrepeated statement are calls for price targets from share on up calls by which need Apple to undergo significant multiple expansion create earnings growth well above expectations or a combination of the two Before the Apple bulls start furiously typing their rebuttals before Ive even started Ill clarify that Im likely more long as a percentage of portfolio weight than nearly any other Contributor here of my managed portfolio now sits in Apple which is a function of years of marketbeating performance continued faith in managements leadership the companys strong free cash flows and a potential tax bill that pains me to even think about it That doesnt mean that I think Apple is a perfect company far from it I have my own ideas on why Apple trades at the multiples it does and what it could do to improve Apple Forward PE ratio to present Im an Apple bull but Im also a realist Longterm shareholders know that Apple trading cheaply isnt a new event The market has always discounted Apple when it comes to valuing future earnings and historically if you take earnings estimates at face value the company is at best marginally undervalued today based on one year expectations The reason for this discount is simple Apple is a highend consumer products company and the company deservingly gets a discount to the market as a result This is driven by the risk that underlies businesses currently earning high margins in expensive consumer goods Other luxury peers have long been plagued by similar issues Michael Kors NYSE KORS Restoration Hardware NYSE RH and many other highend retailers all bear the same cross I dont find that discount inherently unfair as consumers are a fickle bunch While Apple has stayed at the forefront of various product categories for years we shareholders cant assume that Apple tomorrow will be stronger than Apple today Apple is top dog when it comes to consumer electronics and wearing that crown isnt easy When youre churning out operating margins as peers drastically undercut you you have to develop and deliver superior products to incentivize the customer to buy your products instead As a result even minimal margin accretion gains will be hardfought but it only takes a few missteps to undue years of brandbuilding and ecosystem development Luckily for Apples equity returns the company has managed extremely outsized earnings growth year over year which has led to the company to outperforming the market despite continued market pessimism That is where Apple bulls face a problem in my opinion Even the staunchest of Apple bulls should have a hard time imagining a repeat of the earnings growth the company enjoyed from fiscal years in fiscal years Without earnings growth the only way to alpha on the equity is by margin expansion As far as company history goes weve come to an important crossroads in Apples future in my opinion Apple isnt going to grow its way out of its problem without pulling a big rabbit out of its hat and its current core products are not going to grow at the rate they were in the past The market is going to grant the company earnings multiple expansion just because In order to see the trading multiple expand Apple has to deliver a new story a story that dangles the possibility of more consistent protected profits for investors than what the consumer products divisions can provide The path forward for that in my opinion is within software as a service directed towards enterprise customers and businesses Business customers are simply more steady customers on the whole Think forward to what product is more likely to have maintained current margins Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Office suite or Apples iPhone Most professional investors will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>that win Investors especially institutional ones will gladly pay the price higher earnings for that safety That doesnt mean that Apple needs to go out and try and compete in the cloud space with Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Google NASDAQ GOOG or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>The cloud computing ship has sailed and it doesnt pay to start a race in last place and play catch up Honestly a strong move by Apple doesnt even have to be directed toward businesses although thats my idea But overall Tim Cook and team need to have the foresight to spot or just flat out create what could be the next big thing without hesitation Tim Cook has to be willing to whip out the checkbook spending money early on in nascent industry on either acquiring businesses directly or poaching talent Lately Apple has been playing catchup rolling with the industry instead of driving serious innovation More deeply Apples acquisition and cash management strategy has been incredibly passive Thats not a recipe for success and it cant stay that way forever This will require a change of thought process at the top When it comes to acquisitions Steve Jobs and Tim Cook arent all that different from one another While I dont want Tim Cook to go Ballmer on me and start throwing money at the wall to see what sticks I do want the company to be willing to put more of its cash to work and be more reactive I do understand the JobsCook strategy buy small buy cheap buy complementary I get that I really do But Apple management cant be afraid of making a mistake otherwise you dont take home the top prize Apples strength is in its people As a group you wont find a more motivated workforce that wants to impact change and develop innovative products But Apple can do more to foster that environment internally If not it risks losing its most talented people to companies that do see Googles Other Bets segment Im hoping Apple does not lose that luster Its something that IBM NYSE IBM has long suffered with and Id hate to see the company go down that path I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Personal
