believe that Microsofts proposed acquisition of LinkedIn for share or billion represents vast overpayment and a transfer of wealth from MSFT to LNKD shareholders The capital outlay of billion to acquire million in NOPAT earns a return on invested capital of which is much lower than Microsofts topquintile ROIC The bottom line is that Microsofts management should have some explaining to do to justify this acquisition at share We believe that Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT proposed acquisition of LinkedIn NYSE LNKD for share or billion represents vast overpayment and a transfer of wealth from MSFT to LNKD shareholders Weve previously touched on the issues at LinkedIn dating back to our original Danger Zone report in August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>was previously featured as a Long Idea in June largely because of the companys good capital stewardship over the years Todays bid for LNKD is not good stewardship of capital Our models show that even with the most optimistic forecasts over billion or per MSFT share of the billion purchase is an overpayment and a direct destruction of value for MSFT shareholders LinkedIns revenue growth masks growing losses Per Figure LNKDs net operating profit aftertax NOPAT margin has declined from in to over the last twelve months LinkedIns NOPAT has declined from million to million over the same time Microsofts acquisition history has been checkered at best Now the company is paying billion to acquire an unprofitable company The capital outlay of billion to acquire million in NOPAT earns a return on invested capital ROIC of which is much lower than Microsofts topquintile ROIC and below the companys weighted average cost of capital WACC To justify paying share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would need at a minimum LinkedIns NOPAT assuming no capex to be billion or of the billion purchase price At that level the deal would earn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>an ROIC equal to its WACC which is still a low hurdle but at least the deal would not destroy value For reference the highest NOPAT earned by LinkedIn was million in To get a sense of how much shareholder value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is destroying lets look at some reasonable scenarios for how much the company can improve LinkedIns business so that it generates some cash flow First we account for liabilities that investors may not be aware of that make LNKD more expensive than the accounting numbers would suggest billion in offbalancesheet operating leases of market cap prior to acquisition announcement million in outstanding employee stock options of market cap prior to acquisition announcement million in minority interests of market cap prior to acquisition announcement Next Figures and show the implied stock prices that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should pay for LinkedIn to achieve separate goal ROICs assuming different scenarios for revenue growth In each of these scenarios we conservatively assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can grow LinkedIns revenue and NOPAT without any capital spending beyond the billion they are already paying Each scenario also assumes LinkedIn immediately achieves NOPAT margins which are above LNKDs best ever margin of achieved in LNKDs current NOPAT margin is Sources New Constructs LLC and company filings values in millions except per share amounts The first goal ROIC is which is equal to Microsofts WACC The big takeaway from Figure is that even if LinkedIn grows revenue by compounded annually for the next five years the most <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should pay to ensure an ROIC equal to WACC is share or billion less than the proposed purchase price For reference LinkedIn grew revenue by in and consensus estimates peg revenue growth at in and in Note that any acquisition that earned an ROIC would be value neutral and not create value Sources New Constructs LLC and company filings values in millions except per share amounts The next goal ROIC is which is Microsofts current ROIC In Figure we see that even in the most optimistic scenario the most <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should pay for LNKD is share or below the acquisition price Any price above share would destroy shareholder value and decrease Microsofts ROIC The bottom line is that Microsofts management should have some explaining to do to justify this acquisition at share Why should they pay so much for an unprofitable company What sorts of synergies are expected and how do they justify such a big price tag The only reason for a firm to pay a premium over the market value for another firm is if the acquiring firm believes there are significant synergies attainable via acquisition As the deal is constructed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is paying a premium of share from close price or slightly over billion above market price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has yet to make any mention of the dollar value of synergies between the two companies Until investors hold management accountable for intelligent capital allocation they can expect companies to continue to destroy shareholder value without feeling any accountability to their investors Given our analysis above we think it fair to ask both management teams how this deal is fair to their investors The answer for LNKD investors appears easy The answer for MSFT investors is not so easy This article originally published here on June Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
