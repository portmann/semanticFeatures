receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Apple is expecting both iPhone sales and overall revenues to drop next quarter Apple NASDAQ AAPL has seen a serious slowdown in sales of the iPhone Since the smartphone brings in well over of company revenue investors want to know if there are other potential areas of growth Share prices were slammed by the companys fiscal Q earnings release on Tuesday January falling on Wednesday in reaction to the news and this is after rumors of shortfalls had already driven the price down from a high of last February The question for investors is whether this downward trend will continue or if the price will remain range bound as it has for almost a year At this stage of the game any nearterm appreciation appears unlikely Obviously the whole question revolves around growth Can Apple continue to grow Or will it stagnate or even see a decline in its revenue base If iPhone revenues level or decline can anything else replace that growth This article looks at one promising area the category Apple titles in its financial reports as Services Note Most of this analysis will be qualitative I am not trying to propose any specific numbers What numbers I do use are meant to be general examples representative of a range not predictions Barefigures Quarters shown are calendar quarters Note The high year over year growth of fiscal reflects the fact that Q was when the iPod was added to the group raising subsequent comparisons for the year The Services category generated roughly billion in fiscal For this quarter the figure was billion but that included a onetime fee million received from a patent infringement lawsuit Without that the revenue is roughly billion which is the figure used in all subsequent discussions here With this there is a real chance for significant growth and this on several fronts Note It is impossible to figure out exact revenues from the individual services as Apple does not give any further detail in the quarterly reports As I predicted in my post elsewhere the Services category is gaining in importance Apple has done the unique this quarter with the release of some supplemental data One of the pages lists more detail on the Services category and both CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri spent quite some time discussing the category One important part of the Services opportunity is the concept of install base As a major milestone this quarter Apple reached an install base of billion connected devices defined as iPhone iPad Mac iPod touch Apple TV and Apple Watch devices that have been engaged with our services within the past days Clearly this is not the same as billion users as many users own more than one device In some cases devices will share a service particularly music purchases and many apps once purchased can be downloaded to multiple devices without extra charge Services such as HBO Go may be accessed across all but the Watch Still however each one of the devices has the potential to interact uniquely with services For example some apps may be particular to one type of device and not make sense on another One of the reasons the install base is important to Services is that it divides the category in two Most Service products have volume that varies to the install base and continues over time That is the sales as the number of users goes up so does the number of apps sold Recurring fees in particular such as the monthly fees on iCloud or Apple Music definitely grow with the size of the install base although not linearly since these services may be accessed by an individual user from any owned device There are a few services that do not vary with install base but are onetime services available at the time of purchase Apple Care is the most prominent In an unprecedented move Apple provided supplemental data in the earnings release One page focused on the currency issue and others on the Services sector While some of this was likely hand waving to cover up the fact that Apple Watch revenue was less than hoped for it does provide some insight into the Services subcategories As noted above the category can be divided into two parts by whether it is dependent on install base or not The install base partition can also be divided into those services for which revenue is recorded as a whole or only the net income is recorded Sales of music movies and apps have a percentage that go to the rights owners or developers in the case of apps and the remainder to Apple Apple chooses to record only their net on these sales One can view the app store as a service to developers for which Apple charges a fee and the fee is Apples sale to the developer with the rest being passed through This makes perfect sense as otherwise Apple income would be distorted by billions of dollars of music and app sales revenue that would grossly distort margins This way Apple statements focus on the core business In the supplemental data Apple gives a breakdown of this category allowing us to see what portion is from these sales Note that in the FQ data amounts exclude the million received from a patent infringement lawsuit yielding the billion figure The image below is a compressed view of Apples page What we see here is a computation of Apples Installed Base Purchases for fiscal years and and the current quarter This is the total of all the sales for the installed base subsection of the Services category ie with the added back in It is valuable as it gives a view into the total size of this business It does this by breaking out the Install Base Related Revenue IBRR and adding back in the missing For thirdparty applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store Apple accounts for such purchases on a net basis by recognizing in Services revenue only the commission it retains from each purchase This nonGAAP adjustment reflects the portion of the gross amounts billed to customers that Apple remits to thirdparty app developers and certain digital content owners Apple considers nonGAAP installed base related purchases to be a useful metric for investors and management as it provides a more complete picture of the transactions generated by the installed base It also implies three other important figures The sales of the nonIBRR services Apple Care etc The value of the total revenue realized from these digital sales and The IBRR that comes from nondigital sales items in the list above To do No we simply subtract the IBRR line from the total Services revenue Calculations for numbers two and three are actually estimated They assume a split and while this is true for app store and some iTunesiBooks content it is not necessarily the case with other content Still it should give a pretty reasonable estimate So for No the Adjustment to reflect line represents of total commission split sales From the total commission split sales we can take to calculate the how much has been a contribution to the total IBRR Subtracting this out leaves the figure for other services a large part of which should be Apple Music Apples iCloud is an internet service providing email data storage and syncing security features and productivity apps Data including photos are stored in the cloud servers and synced with all of a users devices The security feature Find iPhone allows a user to put an owned device into lost mode so that it cannot be used as well as locate it if it should connect to a WiFi network The system works with iOS devices and Macs as well Apples productivity apps are Pages Numbers and Keynote While the first two are no substitutes for power users of Word or Excel by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT they are very functional for most moderate needs They come free with new OSX systems and on the web An iCloud account manages syncing Newer systems allow Handoff whereby in progress work in one of these apps on an iOS device can automatically be picked up on a Mac and vice versa via simple proximity of the devices The iCloud service is now a revenue generator Originally Apple would store your iPhone photos in the cloud and sync them with your home computer all for free This is still the case but the GB free plan limitation is ridiculously small GB if one wants to store photos in the cloud Now one needs to pay for additional space to do this Plans sell for per month for GBGBTB of storage capacity The service is probably growing at a modest rate Growth here will be somewhat assured since the minimum free plan is inadequate for anyone who takes many pictures or videos Thus the subscription rate will be mostly driven by iPhones in service A number will be driven by Mac users needing to synchronize or collaborate productivity apps but this will be small in comparison With a roughly estimated million iPhones in use worldwide even a fractional usage could give an income of million per month or billion annually The Internet radio service launched last June and reports are that it already has million subscribers The subscription rate is month with a month family plan It may seem like a lot to pay monthly but many people spend much more than that on music purchases If that should double then this would bring an income of approximately billion annually Spotify has million paid subscribers so this is definitely a reasonable goal In fact if the internet radio listening model becomes the norm there is a possibility for even greater revenue The real dark horse here however is Apple Pay I covered Apple Pay in detail in an earlier post and technical details here It should be noted here that one main objective if not the main objective for Apple Pay is to provide the very best digital wallet experience for its customers from both ease of use and security points of view That said there is a real money issue here as well Apple receives just basis points on each credit card transaction it completes Thats per purchase dollar or cents per This comes out of the current service fee to charged by the credit card company on behalf of the bank that backs the card The banks see Apple Pay as a service that provides them with extremely secure transactions and to them this is worth the fee they pay Now this is a minuscule amount that likely currently does not cover the cost of building programming and maintaining the system But the possibilities for the future are more lucrative BI Intelligence reports that they expect mobile payments to reach over billion in just three years and this in the US alone Apple could eventually take up to of this value Not only does Apple have the best system but they have a higher income customer base that makes the most use of mobile payments Adobe reported that on Cyber Monday over million in sales were attributed to mobile and more than came from iOS phones and tablets This in spite of having a smaller overall number of devices Thus it is quite reasonable to suggest Apple Pay may get as much as of transaction value possibly even higher This would lead to only about half a billion dollars in revenue but that would be the US only Additionally it is likely that Apple will expand Apple Pay to mobile transactions This would allow all those Cyber Monday sales to be handled by Apple Pay a simple touch of the finger would be all that is required by the user Finally not only would mobile transactions continue to grow but Apple could conceivably require a higher service fee Altogether it is conceivable that Apple could receive an income of up to billion or more from the service annually This category likely includes fees collected for posting your app on the Apple TV For example it is rumored that Apple gets a percentage of HBO Go revenue generated by Apple TV users Which brings us to the theoretical Apple TV OTT Service in which Apple would provide a customizable cablelike service for a fee Currently the system appears to be on hold as content providers haggle with Apple over terms I assume that subscriber fees would go to the content providers who would then give a service fee to Apple ie Apple would realize as revenue only that portion that it collected for itself not gross fees In this case there would still be a possibility of over billion net annually Lets say that iCloud revenue is already a part the system and that the other services mentioned represent mostly new growth Also lets remember that these figures are not suggested for the current quarter or even for Rather as possible figures for growth in the next few years Then we potentially have new revenues as follows in billions So in several years this category could very conceivably grow adding another billion to revenues It should be noted that some of these categories are likely to have very high profit margins Most of them have high initiation costs that do not go up substantially per number of users Obviously subscription services that pay royalties such as Apple Music will have certain costs that grow with usage but even here development and delivery costs will be relatively fixed I noted that I expected a significant bump from the roughly yy increases of the last four quarters anything over B as promising and anything over as validating my premise here The figure of billion aside from onetime revenue validates the position The growth of yy a increase over the last four quarters validates the premise that services revenues are accelerating A couple of good things about such services is that they provide a level repeated source of income that does not vary substantially over the year and once initiated by a customer they generally continue with modest attrition rates The point here is that Apple detractors have ignored likely growth areas when focusing in on slowing iPhone sales Clearly such sales cannot continue to increase at or even forever However with another potential for billion we see that even if iPhone sales do stagnate we still have room for modest growth over the next few years and this still does not count Apple Watch sales Now the news is out and Apple indeed is looking forward to a significant reduction in iPhone sales for the upcoming quarter This news was expected and while the forward guidance was a bit lower than expected it was not disastrous The market reacted with a drop again with some recovery I expect the price to form a new trading range between more or less and stay there barring any major disruptions until the March quarter earnings release At that time we will be able to assess Apples next future guidance and see if growth in Services takes off Tagged
