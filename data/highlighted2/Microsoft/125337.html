newMicrosoft vision being realized <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has announced new chatcollaboration app Send see below for screenshots The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Garage creation is available today for US and Canadian iPhone users who also use Office Business andor have schooltethered email accounts Theres no telling yet if the app works in an unoptimized state on other iOS powered devices or if it truly is limited to an iPhone launch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has said that Send will soon be available for both Windows and Android phones I think the launch of Send is both symbolic as well as meaningful to the overall company From what Ive read so far across the tech blog scene apparently I think this is much much more meaningful than general consensus Heres why First isnt it ironic that Send would be available on Apple NASDAQ AAPL handsets prior to being available on Windowsoperated handsets Is this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>openly addressing its competitive position in the handset market Or is this like the recent Power BI Summer Update <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>again evidencing itself as being willing to embrace change innovation and best of breed even if it means that isnt inclusive of only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>products I happen to think its the latter and I happen to continue to think thats productive to the longterm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>bull case Moving past that how big is it that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has developed a blendmessaging and collaboration product thats optimized for speed and optimized for mobile Without getting too excited I think the answer is maybe Slack big Thats right maybe Slack big considering Microsofts existing scale and infrastructure Currently Slack is the best blended workplay messaging app available across platforms and operating systems This is generally the consensus opinion and has led to Slacks reported billion private valuation What makes Slack great Slack essentially acts like a Text MessageEmailOTT Messenger Facebook Messenger WhatsApp Twitter NYSE TWTR etc blend that has collaboration deeply integrated into its use cases In Slack I can run multiple chat rooms or Channels as Slack calls them that service both consumer and nonconsumer needs while also running multiple private messaging conversations and private Channels Not only that but I have full upload and sharing capacity across file and workbook types Slack is a great app thats an immediate and highly visible value add If youre not familiar you should definitely get familiar Slack is what I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>intends for Send to compete with when its all said and done meaning when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has optimized Send several iterations from now I think this is ambitious and I think this is exactly what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should be doing throwing down with the best Especially if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>intends to drop Send into its Power BI and Desktop apps which I think is the real reason for going live with Send at such an early stage of development If it isnt the primary reason its one heck of a secondary reason I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is taking a page from the Facebook NASDAQ FB product development and launch playbook in deploying a just past Betadevelopment app for public use in an effort to livetest and refine the product Facebook has done this a number of times in the past with Paper Poke etc and has evidenced how lucrative and effective this can be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>most recently has done with its BI platform combo Power BI and the formerly named Designer now called Desktop Why do I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has any intention of dropping Send into Power BI and Desktop formerly Designer Because in its most recent Summer Update for Power BI which goes live in two days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>updated Power BI and Desktop to have much improved collaboration including support for groups enabling team collaboration and sharing of Power BI content across work groups and what Ive called a quasichat function in which groups can view and share data presumably comment as well As I stated in my Power BI update quite a bit about the collaboration update is still unknown but my guess is whatever is enabled at this point is just the beginning of something great Ive often opined in articles covering Tableau NYSE DATA IBM NYSE IBM Qlik NASDAQ QLIK and Dell that chatting and collaboration are the single largest missing pieces to BI I believe the larger plan for Send is to develop it into a Power BI chatcollaboration function that is meaningful Or maybe well find out in two days that Send or a version of it is already integrated with Power BI as a part of the chatcollaboration update Maybe Send as a standalone app is simply front running the Power BI Summer Update release as a seeding and awareness initiative It will be interesting to unwrap the new Power BI in two days and find out In any case Send and especially where it came from Microsofts internal innovation incubator the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Garage shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is back to being innovative and more importantly innovative in a realtime relevant way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is looking at ways that it can either create products as it has done with Power BI and Desktop or improve on products as its doing with Send that can aggregate broad bases of users Google has more than a handful of products all with over a billion users Chrome Search Gmail Maps etc and has turned this widenet user aggregation into what is seemingly a perpetually expanding market cap and defensibility <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>would do well to follow this strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>can also greatly further its single most focused on and strategic current initiative of unifying its total platform as a whole if it can get Send to show traction over time I explained why this is important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>prior in stating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has one goal right now and thats to unify its platforms into one synergistic closedloop ecosystem Send if it can show traction would be an easy to use and device agnostic app that could be a huge new user base introduction funnel into the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>product ecosystem Again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>clearly understands that this is a mustdo in order to survive going forward and has deployed Power BI and its other SMBenterprise freemium products in an effort to cover lost ground So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has done this quite effectively I might add Most people especially recently view productivity as productivity Instead of reaching for a brand what polling and usage rates are showing is that more and more users are simply picking the best product If Send can evidence itself to be the Slackmobile that even Slack to this point hasnt proven it can be or if Send can show to the markets that it being integrated with Power BI is the difference maker in the BI arena thats going to matter in a big way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>as a whole Again at the very least it shows a strategy and a culture shift from our grandfathers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to one that can be much much more relevant in the new tech normal I have great expectations for what Send and think that its progress is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>investors and enthusiasts should watch Ill update readers as developments come along Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Send Slack And Power BI Disclosure I amwe are long MSFT AAPL FB
