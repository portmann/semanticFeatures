right now is Windows rolling out in new PCs Intel needs to focus on advertising citing the advantages of Windows and existing Intel processors Inventory channel is being cleared for the release of Skylake Earnings from PC sales provide a foundation for expanded Price to Earning ratios from announcements about D NAND D XPoint FPGAs mobile SOCs IoT hubs etc Seeking Alpha has been flooded with articles about Intels NASDAQ INTC new technology with D XPoint being the latest announcement However over the next few quarters this new technology will do nothing for Intel stock price unless earnings associated with PC processor sales increase Net Revenues for the Client Computing Group at Intel from quarter in to fell Almost all of this revenue is sales of processors for PCs In Q of CCG was of Intel Net Revenues falling to in Increases in PC sales will have the greatest impact on Intel earnings and stock price by far when compared to any new technology announced by Intel In addition without an increase in earnings from PC sales the market will generally regard the new technology announcements as just a bunch of words Lets explore what Intel can do to increase PC sales In one word Marketing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT has released Window in new PCs and the joint Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>advertising campaign has begun So far the best add I have seen is from Costco NASDAQ COST The message is that now is the time to buy a new PC with Intel Inside because of better performance and because of the now available Windows Intel Clearing the Inventory Channel My thinking is that the release of Windows without Skylake will help clear the inventory channel of older processor technology Maybe the wait is also due to Skylake software not being ready but the channel does need to be cleared of Broadwell processors before bringing Skylake to shelves The next step after clearing some of the Broadwell processor inventory will be to quickly release Skylake into a variety of PCs I am expecting to see a lot of Skylake products at the Intel Developer Forum August I am expecting to see in person Skylake with no wires no passwords and gesture interface The first part of the back to school period will be focused on Windows with Broadwell processors By the end of the back to school period Skylake products will be on shelves Skylake will then be out in force for Christmas shopping This fits with the focus of each Back to school is more about new and lower cost Christmas is more about new and exciting not so much cost PC Sales form Foundation for Intel Stock Price Increases Lately there have been many amazing Intel announcements that have not done much for the stock price Many have asked why not The main reason I see for the lack of stock price increase following these announcements is that the market is looking for an uptick in earnings Announcements do nothing for earnings In Intel stock only took off when earnings due to increased PC sales hit the bottom line Then the Price to Earnings ratio increased from a low of around to towards the end of This increase in PE Ratio was not possible without PC earnings increases Then the rest of Intels announcements engaged and Intel stock dramatically increased Both the base earnings increase and the announcements provided a synergistic effect that drove Intel stock higher Then came the disastrous downturn in PC sales early in dropping Intel earnings down to a more normal level This downturn in PC sales has continued in anticipation of the release of Windows and Skylake Now it is time to rocknroll In an April article I laid out the case for the Intel train leaving the station The Intel train did leave the station from April to June but it returned in June and July and actually went backwards to the previous station continued decay of PC sales News of rebounding PC sales due to Windows and Skylake combined with Intels Data Center Group growing earnings and announcements across all platforms is likely to drive Intel stock above last years highs during the next four months concluding with another Santa Claus Rally PC sales increases due to Windows and Skylake Data Center Group continued growth in sales and margins Lower power faster and smaller D XPoint memory New mobile SOCs with full mobile IP and sales targets IoT devices including hubs that create a private cloud in your house or small business pure speculation by me New Data Center products including processors SSDs FPGAs communications These announcements will come at two main Intel presentations Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco August technology focus Intel Investor Day in early November financial focus The Intel train is leaving the station again Intel is clearing the inventory channel and getting ready for the next exciting destination Skylake station Source Intel Real Drivers Advertising For Windows Next Stop Skylake
