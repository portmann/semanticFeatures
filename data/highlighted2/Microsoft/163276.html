<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Studios is overseeing Microsofts gaming division and is accounting for roughly of revenue of the whole business Gaming is a part of a broader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>strategy that was revealed by Satya Nadella and plays a crucial role in building corporation ecosystem This years lineup of exclusive games would be the greatest in Xboxs history and will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a space to maneuver in the coming holiday season While its main competitor Sony pushed its major titles to the season now would be the right time to establish a stronger presence in the growing industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Studios is a division of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Corporation NASDAQ MSFT that oversees gaming industry Its primary objectives are to cooperate with first and second party developers and publish their games on different platforms At the end of July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>announced that revenues for the quarter ended June were billion where Computing and Gaming Hardware including Xbox and Surface deliver nearly billion in revenue Gaming is a big deal for the corporation At the end of June Microsofts CEO Satya Nadella revealed companys new mission statement where he included the importance of uniting all its gamingoriented initiatives He said We will pursue our gaming ambition as part of this broader vision for Windows and increase its appeal to consumers We will bring together Xbox Live and our firstparty gaming efforts across PC console mobile and new categories like HoloLens into one integrated play A month after Satya Nadella was appointed CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>he made some changes in the leadership team and chose Phil Spencer to take over all Xbox and Xbox Live operations The first thing that Phil Spencer did was an unbundling of unpopular Kinect from Xbox and Xbox One A few months later it bought the maker of highly popular game Minecraft a studio called Mojang for billion and increased focus on gamers As we see from Nadellas statement Microsofts goal is to connect all of its users with different devices under one ecosystem Gaming division that accounts for roughly revenue of the whole business is a part of that strategy To do this the company did next With the release of Windows a new Xbox App was created by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>which will finally aim to knit Xbox Live users more deeply into Microsofts newest OS Fable Legends would be the first crossplatform game What that means is that you can play it on your PC and your friend could be in the same session with you on Xbox One Phil Spencer said that its the first game of many that will have such an ability Now you can live stream games that you are playing on Xbox One to PCs The viceversa option would be available soon It seems that Xbox will soon be not just a game console but a TVconnected Windows PC too And it sounds like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is hoping that its PC tablet and console hardware will work together to spark more interest and more sales Now if you think that thats not enough and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is losing gaming business to its competitors then look at these numbers For the fourth quarter total Xbox revenue grew based on strong growth in consoles Xbox Live transactions and first party games Xbox Platform revenue increased million or driven by higher volumes of consoles sold offset in part by lower prices of Xbox Ones sold The company sold million consoles in the fourth quarter compared to million consoles during the prior year Xbox Live transactions revenue increased million or reflecting increased users and revenue per user So as we can see the last quarter was great for the gaming division of the corporation and the rise of consoles that were sold will only increase Microsofts influence in the industry And at the same time its ecosystem will only benefit with the presence of new customers that might be interested in other companys products New gamers will only increase the demand for the new gaming titles and as the holiday season approaches a new portion of customers will decide whether to buy a console from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>or from its competitors And thats where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Studios is coming in As we already know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Studios is overseeing and cooperating with its first and second party developers and is in charge of the publishing part of the business Thanks to the job that those guys did this years lineup of exclusive games would be the greatest in Xboxs history First we have a launch of Gears of War Ultimate Edition for Xbox One that was released on August This is a remake for the console that will feature five unreleased chapters of the campaign of the original game that was released on Xbox in and players who purchased the Ultimate Edition can participate in the multiplayer beta of Gears of War which is set to be released in The development of the remake took months and only selected elements like voice performance from the original game were retained Then we have an upcoming racing video game Forza Motorsport The game will include more than cars more than twice the number of cars available at launch for Forza Motorsport and there will be tracks including that are new to the franchise The title already received positive feedback from a lot of people at this years Gamescom and is expected to be released for Xbox One on September Next in line is a new Halo title called Halo Guardians This is the second game in the Reclaimer Saga and continues the story of the Master Chief The set will feature the largest ensemble cast of characters in any Halo game yet with both new and returning characters The game is expected to be released for Xbox One on October and it already received a warm welcome from the public Rise of the Tomb Raider is an upcoming actionadventure video game that will be released exclusively on Xbox and Xbox One on November The version for PlayStation will be available for sale only in fourth quarter of so this would be an advantage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>console In the game players control Lara Croft through various environments battling enemies and completing puzzle platforming sections while using improvised weapons and gadgets in order to progress through the story Other two titles on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Studios lineup are Fable Legends and Below Both are expected to be released exclusively on Windows platform and Xbox Live service for Xbox One at the fourth quarter of The first game is based around four heroes and a villain During each quest the four hero characters must use teamwork to succeed in their objectives while the villain player opposes them with an army of creatures The second is an adventure game viewed from a topdown perspective Its about exploration though that goal is contingent upon the characters survival and is expected to include a multiplayer mode Video gaming market is a billion industry which will reach billion in Main <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>competitors in this field are Sony NYSE SNY and Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY OTCPKNTDOF And the picture currently looks like this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>is still lagging behind Sony to control even of the worldwide video gaming market But it slowly narrows the gap This holiday season would be important for the corporation because there would be the real possibility to take some chunk of market share from its competitors especially from Sony Besides the fact that this years lineup of games would be the greatest in Xbox history <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should use Sonys weakness to acquire new customers And the reason for that is that Sony pushed its major titles to which gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>a space to maneuver by bundling different kind of games to console all type of consumers and have a more flexible discount programs As we can see Microsofts gaming division accounts for roughly of revenue of the whole business Right now there are more than million active Xbox Live users And its important for the corporation in a way that it connects its Xbox gamers with all the other users that are using different kind of companys products and at the same time reaches a broader audience and increases its influence there With the great lineup of exclusive games for Xbox platforms and a weakness of Sonys portfolio of IPs this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>should win the coming holiday season and establish a stronger presence in the growing industry that will increase the shareholder value Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange
