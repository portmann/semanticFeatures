</span>Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Having dipped back to a price of since November it could be a while before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>regains growth from here While dividends have continued to increase earnings growth has so far been lackluster In November of last year I wrote an article arguing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>NASDAQ MSFT may be trading at a significant premium with a price of at the time The reason for my argument was that with a PE ratio of x and an absence of an increase in dividends and earnings investors were potentially placing a premium on future growth which was bidding the stock upwards Subsequent price action has supported my assumptions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has since fallen back to a price of at the time of writing When I first used the dividend discount model to forecast an eventual price target of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>the below is the model that I used to do so forecasting a hypothetical percent yearonyear growth in both dividends and earnings per share Source Authors Calculations November Article It is appropriate at this point to compare actual performance in to what I had initially predicted We can see that while predicted EPS for was actual EPS for has come in at Additionally projected dividends per share were calculated at with the actual figure of meeting expectations Therefore we can see that while dividends have continued to increase earnings have lagged behind expectations In this regard it is futile to assume price will rebound to a level of given current earnings performance and indeed it could be a year or more before we see such appreciation I had put a caveat on my last article in that investors are expecting significant earnings performance from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>to continue growing I had previously expressed positive sentiment regarding Microsofts new product line including the Surface Pro tablets However in spite of general excitement ahead of the release of the Surface Pro tablet next October investors are clearly not sharing such a sentiment With a current PE ratio of x this has dropped slightly from that of last year which means investors may not be as keen to bet on future earnings While the Surface Pro is a step forward for the company the idea of a tabletcomputer hybrid in itself is not unique to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>Companies such as Asus Lenovo Apple etc are already getting in on the game and there is little inherently unique about Microsofts Surface compared to these products Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has not succeeded in building the brand loyalty enjoyed by Apple NASDAQ AAPL and the iPad Pro could well have more success in this regard Ultimately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>needs to continue to be more innovative in further building its cloud initiatives as the opportunity for differentiation in the hardware space becomes increasingly narrower While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>has been making inroads in this regard through its recent acquisition of Adallom competition is still becoming increasingly crowded in this space and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>risks losing its once coveted monopoly in the computing industry on a holistic basis Ultimately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>could well continue to deliver solid dividends and could serve as a good income stock over the coming years However earnings at this point in time are neither here nor there and on this basis I would not be overly optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Microsoft </span>at this point in time Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
