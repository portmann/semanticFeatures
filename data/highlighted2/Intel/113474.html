that only contributes cents of net come for every in revenue The lone bright spot within Intels portfolio is Data Centers which contribute cents of net income for every in revenue and are growing at a annual clip The charts below represent the last nine quarters of Intels quarterly results as well as four of Intels five business cylinders with revenue represented in billions of dollars Mobile was

lines separately because they are so closely coupled in terms of revenue contributions and lack of growth Images Sourced From Wall Street Forensics PC shipments topped m in and there is zero likelihood that we will ever see shipments this high again Over the past years annual PC shipments have declined from m units to under m IDC estimates that PC shipments will remain relatively flat over the next four years which I believe is opportunistic at best With less PC units shipped to spread manufacturing costs over this will pressure Intels ability maintain PC gross margins <span

smartphones with screens greater than five inches also have put a dent in PC demand Over the next few years the introduction of smartglasses will provide additional headwind and challenges for PC

telling sign of the future then the companys aspirations for growth are over Over the past Intels IoT business segment has only gone from of total sales to of sales within a revenue growth environment Intels acquisition of Recon Instruments will help jump start IoT revenue but its not enough to impact the bottom line until The mass adoption smartglasses will take a year or two to develop with the

line over the next months which would have a negative impact on gross margins Intels mobile business segment is essentially nonexistent and there are no hopes for investors that it can contribute any
