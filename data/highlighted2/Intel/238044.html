Hill will come in This new Xeon Phi adopts MCDRAM on package and enhanced Silvermont cores which are completely Haswell binary compatible It is able to work in standalone mode Knights Landing is offered in both socketed version and PCIE version a very welcome solution for HPC Nvidia has various good technology to implement on its next offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQ INTC will have its first Knights Landing commercial systems ready by the end of It is known that the Xeon Phi solutions have been quite successful Indeed they power various supercomputers around the world and they can drive high synergies with traditional Xeon CPUs moreover with Haswell EP Knights Corner surely was a satisfactory accelerator card but Intels new generation will set new standards for what concerns the programming easiness in conjunction with the synergy between CPUs and accelerator cards Nvidia Corporation NASDAQ NVDA will obviously provide new Tesla solutions exploiting the new Pascal architecture in and Volta in Pascal will be a great boost compared to the previous generation Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is providing features that make Knights Landing a very viable solution for HPC and servers In any case both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia will get new revenues and profits from the HPC and server markets since every platform has different advantages and the need of accelerator cards or similar products is constantly rising This series of features in conjunction with the familiarity with x code made Xeon Phi programming much easier in comparison to competitors Xeon Phi have been adopted indeed in of the last years TOP supercomputers entries or updates June while Nvidia Tesla cards have been adopted in supercomputers during the last years Given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a newbie in HPC accelerator cards this achievement is relevant and successful Knights Corner is powered by cores set around GHz with x instructions In addition it has a TDP around W per PCIE card It is noteworthy that Knights Corner Xeon Phi powers the Thiane the most powerful supercomputer nowadays a quite remarkable achievement for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>It must be noted that the x code familiarity permitted to provide a lot of virtualization programs to run Knights Corner through MMXSSE and unlimited access memory without any deep code change Xeon Phi is generally highperforming in those not extremely parallelized applications which are still the vast majority of present programs nowadays in the HPC field Besides the Haswell EP CPUs coaccelerated by Xeon Phi provide a very consistent boost to the entire platform Talking about Knights Landing things get more interesting First it is powered by FP and vectorenhanced Silvermont cores which incorporate additional AVX units that are able to perform AVXF operations There are two AVX units per core and each core is threads capable The maximum TDP will be set at W W with integrated fabric more than rd reduction This new solution provides TFLOPS in doubleprecision and TFLOPS in singleprecision I know that these mere numbers look just comparable to actual Nvidia Tesla solutions bit bit compared to K single GPU and bit bit compared to K dual GPU but this is not the only specific where we must focus since they are useless numbers if taken alone Additionally we must remember that Knights Landing elaborates times FLOPS of what Knights Corner was able to do and therefore the lower theoretical power has not been of any hindrance to Xeon Phis success For what concerns the memory specifics Knights Landing will exploit a technology similar to HBM it is called MCDRAM and it is a variant of the Hybrid Memory Cube researched in partnership with Micron This memory will be stacked up onto the CPU package it will provide GB of memory with a bandwidth around GBsec which is a consistent bandwidth boost and it will directly substitute the L Cache leaving the L cache around MB Anyway the first thing that could be a real game changer is the enhanced Silvermont adoption This move makes any Haswellcompatible binary suitable to be run under a Xeon Phi unit every Haswell instruction set but TSX providing even better code compatibility and programming easiness compared to the past Given that the easy software approach has been a major aspect for Knights Corners success this move is quite understandable and suitable Moreover these chips will be built using the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm technology node which has obviously reached a very good yield factor given that Knights Landing will provide all the projected cores while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could achieve only cores exploiting the nm node with Knights Corner Since Xeon Phi will be essentially Silvermontbased it means that any program could still run using traditional instruction sets even if it does not exploit the AVX units This architecture structure enables another feature these Xeon Phi can run on their own without any other CPU commanding them and doing it with Haswellcompatible binaries is an added value highly welcomed by programmers Considering the high computational potential inside these chips <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>decided to improve even the network fabric partially integrating them onto the Xeon Phi chips This move permits to achieve a great reduction in power consumption adding lower latencies and massive improvements in bandwidth between Phi cards and nodes However this migration is only partial with Knights Landing because the whole network fabric OmniPath will be fully integrated in the successive generation In any case boosts like in peak rate in HFI message rate in switch latency and a bandwidth of GBs in conjunction with a very fine cost control will be something noteworthy of attention in the server and HPC segments As already stated Knights Landing will be powered by beefedup Silvermont cores which are binarycompatible to the Haswell architecture this aspect implies a very high compatibility grade in conjunction with very low code adjustments for already existing programs In addition the various Open MP Open CL Open AAC and various GCC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>compilers are going to be quite more efficient and effective given the Haswell architecture synergies Furthermore Knights Landing is able to run without an external CPU commanding it This implies the most important choice that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made with this product that is a three formfactor offer Xeon Phi will be offered as a PCIE card as a standalone socketed CPU and as a standalone socketed CPU with integrated fabric This means that the socketed route virtually cuts off any intrinsic PCIE latency and bottleneck issue while it is possible to run any kind of programcode with little code effort The synergy between the Haswellcompatible architecture the capacity to run in standalone mode freeing a lot of bandwidth and the addition of MCDRAM modules on the central CPU package will permit programmers to exploit this architecture in a very peculiar and effective way But most of all the chance to run the PCIE card in standalone mode without any heavy code effort is something extremely important and unique We must remember that since the Xeon Phi removes the PCIE bottlenecks using QuickPath it means that it will exploit NUMA capabilities that is sharing memory with all other Xeon processors and making possible a fully comprehensive workload The old Knights Corner has been welcomed due to the programming easiness Now things will get greatly simpler and quite more powerful because the effective power which programmers will be able to extract from these solutions is essentially higher than the mere FLOPS upgrade If programming easiness has been the major factor of Knights Corners success Knights Landing is destined to do even better Nvidia will not remain idle for sure It is going to introduce Tesla Pascal in and Tesla Volta in Tesla Pascal will introduce a new architecture with nm node and it will adopt HBM to reach roughly TBsec of bandwidth which doubles the new Xeon Phi but the socketed version is able to access even the system memory and there is the chance to see MCDRAM with a double bus For what concerns the TFLOPS power Nvidia starts from very good bit FLOPS but bit FLOPS are quite disappointing for what concerns the Maxwell architecture which means that the most part of the node reduction will be eaten up by the augmented FP units aiming to reach half of the FP FLOPS So what could we expect Personally I expect something around TFLOPS in singleprecision and TFLOPS in doubleprecision per GPU a result which would set a single Pascal chip faster than Knights Landing Given Knights Corners success with its programming capacity this kind of theoretical TFLOPS advantage will hardly translate into effective advantages since the majority of apps is not painfully parallelized but things will be quite different once Nvidia releases the Volta architecture in providing additional boosts and architectural refinements But this is not all from Nvidia Pascal will introduce NVLink which will act like Intels QuickPath It is practically an enhanced proprietary PCIE that will be faster than PCIE and it will provide high bandwidth between Tesla cards GPUs and the CPU The issue here is that motherboards will have to be built in an appropriate way and at the moment this is officially supported only by IBM Corp NYSE IBM which implies potential production scalability problems In any case it is an interesting and needed technology for Nvidia It is clear that the new Tesla Pascal will be a very good PCIE card but we will have to see how the deeply enhanced Xeon Phi Haswell compatibility will be important in programming and adoption in conjunction with the threeform factor and the much higher flexibility For what concerns Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ AMD things are more fascinating AMD may provide new serverHPC PCIE cards in future but it seems that it is concentrating over CPUs and APUs in the short term It will implement internal data fabric to avoid latency between CPU and GPU and it will add HBM modules onto the package which will interface to GPU and then CPU through data fabric We can say that AMD is going through a route more similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since it is both a CPU and GPU designer on a serverdesktoplaptop level However now there is only a rumor about an APU with TFLOPS more likely singleprecision in my opinion with a potential TDP of W For what concerns the HPC segment things are still unknown at the moment and it is too hard to delineate the future offer The only known rumors state that server ZEN CPU will come in late while ZEN APUs will come in The only guess that is possible to make is about PCIE cards which will generally be comparable to future Tesla solutions if the Fire cards provide doubleprecision FLOPS as half of singleprecision FLOPS we could expect something roughly around TFLOPS bits and TFLOPS bits while desktop cards will likely push more the bit units There are also EHP rumors but those are set for what we are going to see around and they are very imprecise rumors Another issue that I see here is that AMD uses an LPP node which is suitable for mobile and smartphones frequenciesTDPs but it is not the best choice for desktop SoCsCPUs and is even worse for enterprise products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is pushing hard in the HPC and serverworkstation field where Knights Landing is a consistent and relevant upgrade from various points of view FLOPS power has doubled the fabric has been integrated the architecture is now binarycompatible to Haswell the TDP has been reduced roughly by every unit can act on its own without any CPU commanding it and it is offered both in socketed version and PCIE version Nvidia will likely release a good offer too since its actual Tesla architecture is dated to The green Santa Clara company will probably continue to suffer a programmability and compatibility problem compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>solutions but it has some new features that could be compelling and highly welcomed In addition Nvidia has already a contract to implement its NVlink technology in various motherboards IBM For what concerns supercomputer deals it is already known that Nvidia has a deal to power two IBM Power supercomputers in called Summit and Sierra Sierra will be a PFLOPS while Summit will be between and PFLOPS These supercomputers will probably be powered by the future Tesla Volta cards Talking about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Knights Landing will power the Cori phase II PFLOPS in the Theta PFLOPS in and it is being implemented in the Trinity supercomputer PFLOPS Trinity is peculiar since it will exploit Knights Landing in both the socketed and PCIE card formfactor The thirdgeneration Xeon Phi Knights Hill will power the Aurora supercomputer PFLOPS in instead The takeaway is that both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia will probably be winners since the HPC field it is growing fast and the exascale computing run is pacing steady Given the architectural difference where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is xcompatible and keen to not extremely parallelized programs while Nvidia is keen to extremely parallelized programs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may strike more deals since the majority of HPC programs are not painfully parallelized More than system providers will provide server offers with Knights Landing in both socketed and PCIE card formfactor including all the major OEMs Anyway these kind of supercomputer deals are set to amounts of hundreds of million dollars per deal a very good revenue source for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia Given the actual scenario and stock price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still a very solid investment for the long term and it will be interesting to see if it will be able to catch up in the ultramobile sector too <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is worthy of a Buy even at these levels while Nvidia is a Hold It is better to wait for Nvidia to go down below before making any additional entry
