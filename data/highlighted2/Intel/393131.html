revenue fell sequentially Its profit margins fell to from in the December quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes it can transform the company to power the cloud and billions of connected computer devices Management did not deliver on its mobile promise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC reported quarterly earnings last week and the results were worst than expected I knew PC headwinds would weigh yet did not expect weak to declining revenue growth in its three main segments Revenue from the Client Computing Group CCG was off QQ which followed a uptick last quarter This group includes sales of chips for PCs and mobile devices According to Gartner PC shipments fell for the first quarter of However I believe the culprit this quarter was Intels moneylosing mobile segment It was already a loss leader After Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone sales fell YY it appears that Intels big idea to take share from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM in mobile devices fell hard in Q Other than disappointing performances from the Data Center Group DCG and IoT group the biggest disappointment was Intels profit margins Margins fell from last quarter to this quarter This is unacceptable Declining revenue and falling margins are not what we have come to expect from the former bellwether Miraculously the companys bombastic decision to revamp its strategy and lay off tens of thousands of people overshadowed the margin erosion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced a transformation from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected computer devices It also announced layoffs voluntary and involuntary The plan is to invest in the growth businesses of the future the cloud data center Internet of Things memory and Alteras programmable semiconductors I wasnt convinced Heres why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has broken some its promises in the past so why should we believe the company now Early last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was the largest supplier of tablet systemonchips with market share Its mobile division had also experienced an operating loss of billion I surmised the company was buying market share Management vowed to wring million in costs out of the business However the company consolidated its mobile division into its PC group to create CCG It also masked the performance of the mobile operations making it difficult to track whether management had met or exceeded its target Last quarter management made little mention of mobile from now on when it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Im a show me individual I will believe it when I see it Micron NASDAQ MU has been deemphasizing PCs in order to invest more in a mobile strategy However a declining global economy has punished consumers who are spending less on mobile devices This Micron problem has also beset <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is deemphasizing the PC market to focus on the cloud and connected computer devices This is no cake walk in my opinion First of all Alteras programmable logic semiconductors are expected to help expand the DCG and IoT segments However I never bought this narrative to begin with I always believed that in Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was buying itself a lifeline and a chance to force the market to dismiss its slowing top line growth Sans Altera revenue would have been off by instead of this quarter Secondly Intels prospects in the data center are no picnic As more organizations pursue digital business they should drive a structural shift from legacy IT services to the cloud However when cloud providers like IBM NYSE IBM Alphabet GOOG GOOGL or Amazon NASDAQ AMZN find it difficult to differentiate their services they may have to compete on price To maintain margins that means potentially squeezing vendors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The company currently enjoys market share of over in chips for data centers Market chatter suggests Alphabet could endorse data center chips from Qualcomm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generated nearly billion in revenue last quarter from DCG What happens to that revenue if or when its market share gets chiseled away by Qualcomm Qualcomm has both the capital and the ambition of hitting back at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the data center now all it needs is a proven product I predict that scenario will not end well for DCG or Intels new transformation Avoid the stock Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned
