Gets Of The Miracles It Needs Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD has long been suffering losses both on the CPU and GPU fronts AMD lost so much that it seemingly now needs two miracles One to save it in the CPU market and another one in the GPU market While we dont know if one of those miracles will materialize we recently got information which seems to point to the other one indeed materializing Over the last few years Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD got into a state of disrepair It lost share in its two main segments Source BeyondDcom nbz post The problem was made even larger because its two adversaries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and nVidia NASDAQ NVDA being more successful had more money to plow into RD This in turn allowed them to have better architectures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nVidia and even production processes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Another factor punishing AMD was Intels entry into the GPU battleground by starting to integrate evermorepowerful GPU functionality into the CPU die Indeed this is an ongoing problem At this point AMDs slide has been so long that hopes grew thin it could ever recover AMD needed two miracles to again become competitive in CPUs and to again become competitive in GPUs Against two different larger more profitable and perhaps more capable companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and nVidia I have already written on how on the CPU side AMDs hopes rest with its new Zen architecture to become available in late Whether this new architecture is competitive with the latest from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or not is still open to doubt The first AMD Excavatorbased APUs Accelerated Processing Units combining CPU and GPU in the same die still have a hard time competing with existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>units However AMD promises Zenbased CPUsAPUs will have a increase in IPC Instructions Per Cycle versus Excavator so conceivably AMD could be competitive once Zen is out GPU Side The Miracle Might Have Arrived The true gist of this article is that at least when it comes to GPUs the miracle AMD needed might have arrived AMD had long sustained that with DirectX which is the version that ships with Windows its cards would be more competitive Customers however had no way of knowing this Indeed if anything AMD seemed to be overplaying its cards yet again for as it unveiled its Fury X cards they turned out to apparently once again be slower than already existing nVidia cards GTX Ti For instance AMD provided encouraging benchmarks This alas then seemingly didnt materialize fully This once again disappointed the market and put into doubt AMDs ability to recover the lost GPU share So what hope remained The thing here is that the comparisons showing AMDs latest struggling to match the older nVidia competitor were even if run on Windows still designed for prior DirectX implementations They thus didnt fully utilize DirectX s ability to execute several GPU commands asynchronously which would take much greater advantage of a GPUs true capacity Even now no game on the market has yet implemented such ability But as it turns out the first benchmarks using such feature have become available in the last few days using a game thats being readied to take advantage of it Ashes of the Singularity And therein the miracle saw the light It turns out that AMDs cards and not just its latest do outperform nVidias once this feature is used And whats more they outperform nVidia on account of a structural hardwaredetermined advantage That is nVidia cant recoup the difference through driver changes though it can minimize the disadvantage Thus it will take an whole new nVidia generation to bridge this gap and its not certain that nVidia will deliver it whereas its a nearcertainty that AMD will keep this advantage in its nextgeneration architecture While existing games dont utilize this feature new ones quickly will Moreover the gaming community will quickly take notice of this difference As such its likely that until nVidia bridges the gap AMD will start closing the GPU market share gulf This fact thus becomes a possible catalyst favoring AMD going forward The impact should start right away as the gaming community becomes aware of AMDs intrinsic advantage when it comes to games fully utilizing DirectX In my articles titled The Best Way To Bet On Virtual Reality and Virtual Reality Winners Part Spectra I had talked about how the Oculus Rift launch could constitute a positive catalyst for highend GPU sales as well as cable chips This was so because Virtual Reality as implemented in the Oculus Rift needed a lot of GPU grunt At the time the logic was based on Facebook NASDAQ FB pricing the Oculus Rift around the price of the Development Kit Instead Facebook decided to go with premium pricing to milk the early adopters It thus priced the consumer version at much higher than expected This will slow initial adoption of the device Thus it will become less of a positive catalyst than otherwise expected AMD needs two miracles to turn the tide on CPUs and discrete GPUs It has a shot at doing so in CPUs when it launches its Zen corebased CPUs in late and early but thats still an unknown quantity However very recent benchmarks do seem to indicate AMD has managed to leapfrog nVidia when it comes to GPUs owning to DirectX better using its hardwares capabilities I expect that the spreading of this knowledge will lead to AMD regaining some of its lost GPU share and such can have a positive and unexpected impact on its fundamentals Given AMDs financial situation I dont know if this is positive enough to warrant buying the stock Still I couldnt avoid reporting on this significantly positive development for AMDs prospects Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
