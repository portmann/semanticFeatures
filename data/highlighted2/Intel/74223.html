Alpha ASUSTeK has again opted to use the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom Z for its latest inch Android tablet The Asus ZenPad S touts GB of RAM K IPS display and USB TypeC port ASUSTeK OTCASUUY unveiled four new Android tablets Monday during the Computex event The most impressive of the bunch is the inch Asus ZenPad S ZCA which is equipped with a bit GHz <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Atom Z quadcore processor Asus was the first manufacturer to debut a GB RAMequipped smartphone with the ZenFone and it is again the pioneer in releasing the worlds first inch tablet with GB of RAM The huge amount of RAM makes this tablet a multitasking powerhouse While no official price tags were revealed yet the other highend hardware specs of the ZenPad S hints that is a premium tablet that could compete with the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPad Mini and Dell Venue premium tablets The image above from Lowyatnet also reveals that the ZenPad S has the latest USB TypeC port used in the new MacBook Air K display x resolution and Z Stylus compatibility The Z Stylus is similar in purpose to Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT tablet stylus for the Surface and Surface Pro The Zenpad S is therefore ideal for enterprise users who are accustomed to the pen input style of the Surface tablet and Samsung OTCSSNLF Galaxy Note If Asus could get carrier support for this product like what Xiaomi did with the Mi Pad tablet the ZenPad S might get bulk orders from Corporate IT managers looking for a cheaper alternative to the Galaxy Note Surface The Z Stylus also makes the ZenPad S attractive to creative professionals There is also the obvious potential of this Intelpowered inch tablet to catch the attention of mobile gamers The huge population of tablet gamers around the world is one reason why it might be good for Asus to market the GB RAMequipped ZenPad S as a gamescentric tablet As per Asus track record of pricing its products the ZenPad will be cheaper than the iPad Mini Asus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have a great track record of creating nonoverheating smartphones and tablets that ingeniously combine x Atom processors with ARMbased GPUs from Imagination Technology The ZenPad S has the same PowerVR G GPU used by Apple in the iPhone S iPad Mini and iPad Air However I am highly confident that the Asus tablet will prove to be the better gaming tablet The Asus MemoPad and Nokia NYSE NOK N Android tablets both have GB of RAM also use the same Atom Z SoC and PowerVR G GPU and they both outperformed the iPad Mini and iPad Air The upcoming GB RAMequipped ZenPad S is also highly likely to beat the GFXBench test scores of the iPad Mini iPad Air I think the ZenPad S is the updated version of the excellent MemoPad AST tablet that was released last year The ZenPad S is a product that might not be as painful as other Atompowered Android tablets that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been subsidizing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has an urgent need to reduce its contra revenue on mobile devices to prepare itself for the allcash transaction billion buyout of Altera NASDAQ ALTR Unlike Microsoft which generates billions in dollars from licensing its patents to Android device makers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cannot afford a protracted contra revenue approach to mobile I also doubt that the Altera acquisition will generate enough new revenue to make up for selling Atom processors at below cost to OEMs Alteras FY revenue was less than billion I understand that Intels generous subsidies is an effective tactic to win and retain the loyalty of hardware manufacturers However I am now advocating that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>focus more on selling profitable x mobile processors to OEMs Microsoft can afford to subsidize tabletssmartphones because it has strong revenue streams from WindowsOffice licensing and subscriptions Microsoft also has a decent advertising business which is something that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also lacks I was wrong in my previous assumption that Asus will not release a ZenFone with Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon processor this year The ZenFone Selfie Android handset which was also revealed yesterday at Computex has the same overheatingprone octacore Snapdragon processor found inside the HTC OTCHTCXF Galaxy Alpha A Xiaomi Mii and Yu Yureka Android phones The Qualcommpowered ZenFone Selfie is just another clone of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom Zequipped ZenFone However the ZenFone which has been proven to not overheat even under intense D gaming sessions again outperformed those overheating Snapdragon equipped Android phones on GFXBench tests I see no compelling reason for Asus to use the Snapdragon in the ZenFone Selfie Asus experiment with the Snapdragon could even harm the ZenFone brand In this age of viral online reviews an overheating ZenFone Selfie YouTube review could also affect the sterling reputation of the Intelpowered ZenFone The overheating issue of Qualcomms octacore Snapdragon processors is probably why even Xiaomi is planning to use MediaTeks new Helio X chips for its next flagship Android phones However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should redouble its effort to win the support of Xiaomi Xiaomi is more successful than Asus when it comes to smartphones and tablets The old Bay Trail Atom Z inside the upcoming Asus ZenPad S and ZenFone is not as gamesperfect as the Tegra K SoC used in the Xiaomi Mi Pad But there were leaks before that Xiaomis upcoming Mi Pad tablet has an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processor Only x processors can dualboot Windows and Android OS right now Xiaomi will have to buy processors from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>if it wants to compete with other Chinese manufacturers who are already shipping out Intelpowered dualboot phones and tablets Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a
