Plan Sponsors need Professional Independent Advice The Big Picture June am by Barry Ritholtz Dan McConlogue is the Director of Corporate Retirement Plans at Ritholtz Wealth Management Dan is the principal and founder of Eleven OClock Associates a retirement plan consulting firm based in FloridaDan joined RWM at the start of as ourDirector of Corporate Retirement Plans His most recent post was The Evolution of CorporateSponsored Retirement Plans When I hand someone my business card Director of Corporate Retirement PlansI often get asked questions about what Im working on or what I think of recent regulatory changes Recently a plan sponsor asked me both of those questions A lot I said and when pushed I cited several themes that were on my mind after our most recent Investment Committee meeting One in particular is under reported and very interesting I think the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>lawsuit is one that every Investment Committee for every large scale k plan in the United States ought to be familiar with Its a bit like the WalMart lawsuit where in the plan sponsor was found negligent for failure to provide the participants with lower cost mutual fund shares which their assets qualified them for only a lot worse I went on to share the recent story from Bloomberg BNA News October on class action lawsuit directed at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>k Investment Committee specifically addressing changes made by that IC which were so poorly conceived expensive and probably inappropriate per regulatory standards as to give the members of that Investment Committee a lot of sleepless nights And it shouldthe story is a cautionary tale In a span of less than years the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investment Committee took the plans investment options and changed them by a magnitude of fold taking million of Alternative Investments and raising that amount almost million in just a few years Worse they the investment committee directed that these expensive and not exactly appropriate securities be added to the seemingly vanilla Target Date Funds that they themselves designed DidIntel plan participants truly rank file workers understood what was under the hood of those Target Date Funds As the complaint states the Investment Committee invested a significant portion of the plans assets in risky and highcost hedge funds and privateequity investments I askedthe plan sponsor Whats the difference between doing what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has allegedly done versuswhat other Investment Committees do by the score Only instead of hedge funds or private equity they leftunnecessarily high cost high turnover and often poorly performing mutual funds on their plan platforms In terms of performance and fees mutual funds can be as every bit as bad as alternative investments What is worse is the lack of processthese Investment Committees are using for their due diligence and ongoing monitoring of the investment selections This is a process that shouldcould keep them in compliance with all regulations and dramatically reduce their individual fiduciary liability Here we have really smart people and lets take this as a given people who in all likelihood wanted to do the right thing for their fellow employee participants and they totally missed what they were meant to be doing and how they were meant to be acting in the best interest of the plan participants as mandated by law Here again from the Bloomberg article emphasis mine The complaint filed Oct in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that the plans fiduciaries deviated significantly from professional investment norms when they dramatically altered the plans asset allocation models to invest in the hedge funds and privateequity investments As many as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>employees who participated in the k plans could be included in the lawsuit if the case is certified as a class action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act The main defendant in the lawsuit is Intels investment policy committee that was charged with oversight of the investments in Intels two defined contribution retirement plans It isnt all hubris although there seems to have been plenty of that but it is astounding that a firm with a plan that size a company with resources that vast could screw up the plans and perhaps themselves so royally Inappropriate decisions on plan assets happens much more often than one would think but in most cases it isnt because the investment committee was choosing expensive and illsuited hedge andor equally expensive illsuited and highly ill liquid private equity funds Most of the time its the WalMart errors that plan fiduciaries make but on the whole plan fiduciaries have no idea what their individual liability is what is truly expected of them as stewards of the plans they serve and no one on board with sufficient experience and independence to guide them through the prudent process of being a plan fiduciary Heres a sobering thought to leave you with from the actual complaint itself The Investment Committees allocation decisions not only deviated greatly from prevailing asset allocation models adopted by investment professionals and plan fiduciaries but also exposed the Plans and their participants to unreasonably costly and risky investments in hedge and private equity funds the lawsuit alleges The complaint goes on to allege that Intels TDFs Target Date Funds underperformed peer TDFs by approximately basis points annually a year Because there were billions of dollars allocated to the TDFs the complaint alleges that the plans have lost hundreds of millions of dollars they would have earned if the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>TDFs had been prudently allocated Truly I suspect that there arent that many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stories out there in k land but there are hundreds probably thousands like the WalMart storyThe days of having your former college roommate or brother in law sell you a k plan loaded with financial incentives for that brother in law are over Plan Sponsors and those who serve on Defined Contribution Investment Committees are on notice they have real quantifiable fiduciary responsibilities on which they will be judged It isnt hard to meet these responsibilities it just requires guidance without conflict of interest and a firm grasp on the concept of acting always in the participants best interest Barry L Ritholtz is the founder and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management Launched in RWM is a financial To beat the
