Intels Server Segment Will Accelerate In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha The server segment is well positioned but various growth catalyst will drive earnings and revenue growth in FY Some of this growth comes from unanticipated product categories paired with the opportunity to scale serverCPUs into applications that run better on standardized CPUs I anticipate that net income from the segment will nearly double by as the growth projection seems well supported I anticipate that the addition of new products continued ASP improvements and ongoing unit growth for Xeonbranded CPUs will sustain the revenue CAGR with some bias to the upside While I acknowledge all of these growth catalysts I dont anticipate the stock to move considerably higher until FY Therefore I continue to reiterate my hold recommendation Intels NASDAQ INTC Data Center Group is the lone bright spot of the organization as the company is heavily dependent on both the profitability and growth potential of the segment For the most part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continued to emphasize the longterm growth rate of for the data center group throughout last weeks Data Center Day but also mentioned that there could be upside to those estimates assuming cell network transformation is inclusive of more adoption of serverclass CPUs and the attach rate for D XPoint drivesmemory is better than expected Of course D XPoint adoption will come from HPC high performance compute clusters first as advanced scientific institutions are starting to reach the glass ceiling of performance for more advanced computer models There was a lot of information presented at Intels Data Center Day Conference at its Santa Clara headquarters It was the first time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ever hosted an Data Center Day and was primarily attended by industry and sellside analysts Its not clear if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will host this event annually but given the rapid developments in the server space it wouldnt be surprising to see another one next year The company mentioned that the memory and storage business is going to be priced for profitability and while the company did acknowledge competitive threats to the highervalue memory product that they had recently developed the priority will be to recoup investment rather than broadening adoption through aggressive pricing In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will go back to its advanced calculus models to determine the best way to optimize profitability and volumes The company also has a lot of spare capacity in its fabs to handle unanticipated demand so investors wont have to encounter supplyrelated difficulties when factoring in revenue ramp from storage and assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does have the bestperforming storage solution in the timeframe revenue from this segment will grow at a relatively explosive rate when compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs and FPGAs Demand is starting to shift to highend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon E SKUs There isnt a lot of demand for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon E SKU but there is some upside to ASPs Cloud providers have consistently transitioned their data centers to highertier SKUs over the past five years Needless to say the performance per watt improves further up the product stack but the adoption rate has been slow due to the broadness of price tiers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mentioned that various largescale cloud service providers have been slowly moving up the SKUs which add some additional upside to longterm growth models Growth in new product categories like Xeon branded coprocessor units graphic accelerators storage D NAND and D XPoint FPGAs and network connectivity solutions Silicon Photonics Ethernet and Infiniband Switch also supports longterm growth assumptions Furthermore ARMbased CPUs were mentioned at Data Center Day but for the most part largescale deployment of ARMbased components seem highly unlikely based on the comments that were mentioned Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mentioned that it had higher performing SKUs at the mobile component level so even if ARMbased vendors compete in Data Centers its likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will generate the vast majority of the volume Today Atom CPUunits represent a small rounding error when it pertains to server revenues So competing platforms using mobile components or different instruction sets dont seem very competitive With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at plus market share growth assumptions are primarily tied to the growth of the entire market and new product offerings The growth mix is less than from IT cloud is greater than comms service providers greater than and HPC greater than These growth rates are annualized and are expected to sustain over the foreseeable five years Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to sustain a CAGR in DCG revenue I anticipate that the DCG will generate billion in revenue in FY which will contribute billion in net income to Intels bottom line assuming a tax rate and operating margins In Intels data center group generated billion in profits so the incremental net income from the segment will almost double To compare those figures to FY I project the DCG group to generate billion in revenue on similar profit rate assumptions The profit from the segment will grow to billion assuming stabilization in enterprise demand in Q and Q Of course there are some factors that can negatively impact the longterm growth assumption of DCG such as foreign exchange and anemic demand from enterprise IT providers The growth from traditional IT is projected to be much less than that of other categories and is of the current revenue mix for DCG But barring those uncertainties the upside to DCG will be pretty substantial When looking historically Intels revenue hasnt grown by much between and Much of this was driven by stagnating demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs in clientside computing and the rapid adoption of mobile devices which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>didnt really participate in The product mix was heavily concentrated in CPUs which was a cyclical business Going forward I anticipate that with the exception of which will be a flat year for consolidated revenue revenue will begin to accelerate on the back of PC refresh and rapid cloud deployment When looking at Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Amazons NASDAQ AMZN and Alibabas NYSE BABA conference calls theres a lot of optimism about the cloud Furthermore capex spend is expected to tick higher Of course investors are a little antsy about the scale of investment from various cloud providers The demand consistently outstrips projections which forces cloud providers to invest even more aggressively into their data center buildout to accommodate for future demand The compression on FCF shouldnt be too surprising The market has reasonable expectations for the variability of spending so as long as growth from these investments can be sustained In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is well positioned in the data center space And while Im continuing to reiterate my price target and hold recommendation I do anticipate that the stock will begin to recover and momentum will be particularly strong in so as long as broader market sentiment continues to improve Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
