Alpha Some industry watchers believe Intels server chip business could take a hit with the launch of IBMs Linux servers IBM claims its new servers are capable of completing average workloads at less than half the cost and more than twice the speed of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeonbased server Intels upcoming Broadwellbased Xeon processors which will be released in the first quarter of will present tough challenge to IBMs new servers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is the market leader in the server chip business with its Xeon line of servers In an effort to take the server chip business away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IBM NYSE IBM has launched its new Power processorbased Linux servers which are faster and cheaper than a similarly configured xbased server powered by Intels Xeon E processor IBM claims IBMs internal testing showed that its new Power Systems LC line of servers are capable of completing an average Apache Spark workload at less than half the cost of an xbased <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon E powered server IBM claims the LC line of servers can provide customers times better performance per dollar spent compared to the xbased Xeon powered servers Embracing an open model of innovation has enabled us to build systems that help translate mountains of data into actionable business insight By collaborating with partners from the OpenPower Foundation our new line of servers provides clients with the performance they need to analyze and act on their data in real time With IBMs server business declining continuously the launch of its new line of servers is a desperate move to retain market share IBM is targeting the enterprises and the HPC high performance computing segment with its new line of servers In the first quarter of worldwide server market grew yearoveryear in terms of revenues while IBMs server revenues plunged according to IDC It said IBM retained its number position following its x divestiture with billion in revenue and market share IBMs revenues are now associated with its Power and mainframe product lines IBMs market share fell to from in the yearago quarter IDC further said that in the first quarter worldwide volume server revenue increased to billion driven by continued expansion of xbased hyperscale server infrastructures As long as this trend continues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has nothing to worry about In case of volume servers each server is assigned one role In case of lower volume or midrange servers each server is assigned multiple roles In the midrange segment revenue increased to billion The midrange segment is dominated by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x processors IBM has no role here However the situation is changing in the volume server segment where IBM Power processors used to dominate the market earlier While IBM still enjoys leadership position in the nonx segments with its mainframe and Power processors the situation is worsening with intensifying competition from xbased servers in the Power segment The mainframe segment saw a yearoveryear revenue increase of to billion in the first quarter driven by IBMs z refresh However the Power segment is lagging far behind I dont believe IBMs new Power Systems LC line could be a potential threat to Intels server chip business While choosing between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x and Power virtualization makes the real difference The demand for xbased virtual servers is rising rapidly due to their increased efficiency with various Linuxbased hypervisors such as VMwares NYSE VMW ESXi or Red Hats NYSE RHT KVM With the increasing popularity of hyperscale OpenStack clouds in softwaredefined data center SDDC I strongly believe the demand for Intels Xeon line of processors will continue to rise I have discussed the future potential of virtualization on x hardware in greater detail in a previous article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will release two Broadwellbased Xeon E processors Xeon E v and E v in the first quarter of IBMs newly launched Linux servers will face tremendous competition from Intels upcoming Xeon processors In a previous article I shared how Intels product differentiation strategy will help the company retain market share amid a challenging and competitive business environment I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a
