as usual or they will they change their game <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is buying Altera NASDAQ ALTR How does this affect Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX and what should they do about it I have to admit that until years ago I would have said Xilinx would get bought by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>After all Xilinx invented the modern FPGA Xilinx is the market leader Xilinx owns the university market along with the minds of future FPGA designers and programmers Xilinx will now face <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>not Altera in the market place Both Altera and Xilinx each have around people worldwide Altera and Xilinx have similar business vital statistics with Xilinx having market share to Alteras It was a duopoly It wont be any more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has over employees Intels net income is times more than Xilinxs total revenue and Intels net income is over times that of Xilinx Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has job openings s of the number of employees that Xilinx has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the sales force to beat Xilinx everywhere <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can drop the margins on Altera FPGAs without even rattling Wall Street This allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to undercut Xilinx on deals that they are currently competing with Altera for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the gorilla in the room and will eventually find Xilinxs lunch and take it Big companies are slower Applied innovation is going to be the key if Xilinx is to beat the IntelAltera machine While larger companies can innovate it often takes time to implement that innovation If Xilinx can do the things that Altera wont do until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes them then Xilinx can jump out ahead in the billion dollar data server market Altera will now be forced to directly face the many facets of reconfigurable computing not just making an ASIC replacement Xilinx has a better configuration fabric than Altera Xilinx has been doing run time reconfiguration RTR for years and has the knowledge and expertise Without the proper management of the RTR fabric FPGAs are limited to one configuration per program You need to quickly swap configurations to be competitive in the data center computing world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has other competing products in the data center space If FPGAs are to replace processors the fight will be internal to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and big company politics will be in play The internal fight will be to keep the status quo culture of the bigger company Altera will lose this fight and become slower at adopting change than they have in the past This will allow Xilinx to move quickly into the greener pastures of big data server market To be part of the mainstream big data server market is an x strategy While ARMs are becoming popular x had of the server market in To be a player in the server market will require a mature respected x strategy Xilinx should buy Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD AMDs market cap is only billion and Xilinx probably has that much cash in hand This would let Xilinx get in on the x FPGA fabric tsunami thats about to come AMD had just released their th generation CPU device that incorporated GPU Xilinx has done the same AMD and Xilinx have been smashing up different computing architectures and both have expertise in integrating a number of different IP blocks into single architecture With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>buying Altera there is a chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will break Altera management style There is lots of politics at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and many at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>dont like the idea of FPGA based computing FPGAs architectures are quickly evolving architectures CPUs not so much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will slow down Alteras innovation rate On the other hand if Xilinx buys AMD its AMD who will have to speed up their innovation rate and that would be good for them Xilinx could be in charge of its fate and look at this as an opportunity to change before the coming flood or it could just drown in a sea of IntelAltera blue Disclosure The author is long ALTR MoreThe author
