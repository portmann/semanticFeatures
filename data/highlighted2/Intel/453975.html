</span>optimism in its long term guidance may buoy the stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC will announce earnings for second quarter and guidance for third quarter on July after the markets close I expect Q earnings will disappoint the market and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will talk optimistically about the future but will not be able to support strong guidance for Q although guidance may be slightly higher than Q because sales that quarter were low The recent upgrades to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made by Bernstein and RBC appear to be based on longterm factors such as increasing PC sales and modem sales into some iPhones PC sales volumes may be increasing but the mix also is changing There are strong PC sales in the gaming area and the more portable PC area Unit costs in the gaming area are high but the quantities are not high enough to offset the lower unit prices and higher sales quantities in more portable PCs I expect PC revenues to continue to drop in the high single digits or low double digits during Q and Q The sale of modems into iPhones is critical for the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the IoT and in the increasingly larger and all encompassing mobile arena even if they do not sell much into mobile phones Every computing device now is becoming more mobile or is connected to more mobile devices eg desktop PCs and data centers connected to mobile devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem success is critical to its success in being a major player in the G movement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must have tech in mobile devices and hubs and data centers that deals effectively with communication among all devices However in Q and Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem sales into iPhones will have a negligible impact on overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings The recent upgrades by Bernstein and RBC provide a shortterm boost in market optimism and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price Earnings for Q and guidance for Q will not be benefited by the items cited in the upgrades The market will likely be disappointed with the stock price will likely fall after earnings are reported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to have an endless supply of onetime accounting strategies that help to moderate drops in revenues For example onetime reductions in income tax often coincide with drops in sales revenues I would not be surprised to see some sales of venture capital or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>operations units to help moderate continuing drops in revenue Investments in the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are huge and create a drag on margins It is impossible for us investors to understand the full extent of Intels investments in new tech The new tech list is long including Telcom eg Network Function Virtualization FPGA eg replacing ASIC and supporting Telcom and IoT IoT eg end to end functionality and security Some investment dollars show up in RD some in capital investments some in employee stock options and offsetting stock buybacks The total of these three items routinely add up to more than billion a year In addition transitions from one tech to another reduce output Further market anticipation of new tech reduces demand for older tech These are all extremely hard to quantify Yet they are all currently dragging on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has embarked on a significant staff reduction effort to reduce company costs and to better prepare it for the products that will support <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>growth going forward This staff reduction effort also is a huge investment that reduces margins in the near term with the hope of longer term benefits Pulling off this type of a transformational set of investments spending on new tech and cutting costs related to old tech while maintaining margins is an extremely difficult task that would require lots of hard work creative accounting and luck <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price may rise going into earnings and then will likely drop after disappointing earnings and guidance associated with Q Longer term optimism may buoy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock so shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is risky The safest approach may be to sell now before earnings and be ready to buy after earnings I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Additional disclosure Right now I have a very small position a few shares in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and am looking for an
