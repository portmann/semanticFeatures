Is Intels Banner Year While Was A Total Fluke <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Theres no denying Intels price performance cratered in as the PC environment wasnt exactly forgiving and reaching DCG growth targets proved to be difficult this year However as we turn over the page into next year new products targeted at enterprise ongoing cloud ramp and organic IaaS growth drives DCG assumptions Furthermore the client computing group should experience a recovery due to stabilizing PC shipments improving pricing mix gross margin improvements and mobile profitability Thankfully theres even more upside to our top line and net income figure due to Altera integrationaccretion The incremental upside is left out of the CFOs and analyst models I anticipate the share price to react to all of these positive developments Earnings multiple expansion seems highly likely hence I have raised my PT and rating on the stock Things got a little patchy throughout Intels NASDAQ INTC FY as evidenced by the price volatility However its fair to say that the stock is worth looking into given the various efforts to produce shareholder value through RD share buybacks strategic divestitures and cost efficiency gains Its hard to understand the various corporate level dynamics but I plan on dedicating this article to that effort as its worth exploring the incremental upside as we transition into Furthermore I think its worth mentioning that there will be better performing semiconductor peers when compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but by no means will INTC be a Dow laggard next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely outperform when compared to the Dow Component and while its hard to anticipate the directional momentum of the broader stock market my bias is to the upside despite currencyinterest rate headwinds Intels CFO Stacy Smith went into excruciating detail on the various growth drivers in the annual shareholderanalyst meeting In an effort to consolidate all of that information I may leave out some key points from that presentation Over the course of the datacenter revenue mix will shift to onethird cloud revenue The conventional enterprise is buying fewer severclass CPUs as largescale IT departments have opted for hybridcloud configurations to save on costs Of course this plays to Intels advantage as data needs are expected to explode due to the Internet of Things and rapid deployment of consumerfacing applications The cloud is extremely flexible for mobiledesktop deployment of apps and the incremental cost advantage of shifting over to the cloud has been felt by numerous corporate IT clients The infrastructure component of the cloud is growing rapidly and while there has been a lot of activity in the softwareplatform segment of the cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the vast majority of the incremental silicon opportunities They have released a variety of products over the years to address various usecases The incremental product opportunities are inclusive of XeonPhi FPGAs Silicon Photonics TLC NAND and D XPoint memory I see the adoption of these new product categories a key component of realizing the growth assumption for the enterprise segment Furthermore while theres a lot of competition within the enterprise space theres no denying that Intels custom siliconstorage portfolio offers better TCO total cost of ownership The CFO mentions that growth will fluctuate in the data center group So forecasting growth at a linear pace might not paint an accurate picture on a yearbyyear basis However the nature of financial modeling necessitates us analysts to create linear extrapolations as such investors should anticipate the quarterly reports to fluctuate between better than expected or inline with consensus estimates on an ongoing basis The DCG composes a high percentage of the profit mix so the quarterly swing from DCG will be in terms of diluted EPS as opposed to revenue What really drove optimism at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investor day was the incremental upside potential of the Client Computing Group formerly known as the PC Client Group The CCG is inclusive of mobile and what was surprising was the robustness of the segment despite forecast assumptions indicating modest shipment decline for the fullyear Of course the PC market could in fact stabilize When based off of various channel checking sources the PC market is expected to bottom out in QCY so the CCG could perform a lot better than what Intels own CFO anticipates Nonetheless the upside to CCG was driven by growth in mobile revenue and lower mobilerelated costs The RD for that segment is expected to decline and operational profits seem feasible While no one is anticipating the company to gain substantial mobile share throughout the companys mobile lineup is stronger than it was in the past But like others have noted without a cutting edge modem theyre restricted from selling their Atom platform into the high end At this point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>isnt abdicating from mobile but they are prioritizing investment into other areas of the organization that could use the incremental RD Theyre expecting low doubledigit operating profit growth from the CCG and more than million in profitability from mobile specifically Now I know this contradicts statements made by others on this website but quite frankly the internal accounting metrics of a company are far more indicative and reliable than attempts to analyze using external accounting statements Intels guidance for CCG is flat to low single digit revenue growth and operating profit growth in the lowteens The growth in operating profit is driven by falling costs for nm wafers as they anticipate better yields from their fab Furthermore product segmentation will drive ASPs over the course of FY driving top line assumptions The incremental cost reduction to mobile and growth in lowend mobile sockets adds some upside from prioryear comps Of course the growth in that segment could surprise Since sales primarily come from that segment the revenue missbeats in upcoming quarters could deviate from consensus expectations more significantly Based on managements outlook and integration of Altera I anticipate revenue to grow by in FY Of course my estimate differs from Street consensus and managements outlook as I calculate the impact from Altera separately I dont believe managementanalyst estimates are inclusive of Altera as the DCG was projected to grow at per annum without Altera included Furthermore it also helps that CCG is expected to grow by low single digits due to pricing improvements and mobile The core growth rate of IoT software and other is approximately however this growth rate may differ materially due to divestitures in the software segment Nonetheless growth in storage and IoT has been fairly consistent and given the launch of new storagememory products I anticipate high single digit growth in the segment not inclusive of Altera I anticipate net income growth of in FY This is mostly driven by revenue and a modest reduction in operating expenses The gross margin should remain stable between FY and FY however there could be upside to gross margins assuming higher volumes at better yields Of course volumes will be driven by CPU demand To stay conservative I anticipate the growth rate to be roughly equivalent to Intels guidance hence a gross margin rate I anticipate share buybacks to slow in FY The billion in incremental buybacks wont offset the dilution impact from convertible debt and share bonuses The stock price will likely increase which will trigger employee options and debt to equity conversions Furthermore the annual run rate of dilution exceeds the impact from share repurchases and the authorization wont be increased unless FCF improves materially Since were in an investment year where capex will ramp in response to the nm transition I cant see a window of opportunity for higher share repurchases Furthermore the net income growth also is inclusive of incremental expenses pertaining specifically to Altera I anticipate the tax rate to increase by a couple points when compared to While Im well aware <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reports a lower tax rate when compared to the US average the incremental impact from higher earnings wont be completely offset by tax credits and offshore tax shelters The diluted EPS growth rate is in midteens as a result of the dilution impact I anticipate some earnings multiple expansion throughout FY The stock has exhibited multiple expansion over the trailing month period so investor sentiment will likely improve which translates to a higher forward PE While valuation trends are hard to accurately articulate I believe the stock will trade at times earnings over the next months The valuation is definitely within a feasible range as its driven by strengthening fundamentals and a relatively strong equity environment Due to these various factors Im raising my recommendation from buy to high conviction buy I raise my month price target to from I anticipate upside from the prior overnight close Of course there could be additional upside but I tend to avoid pushing the cart ahead of the horse We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information
