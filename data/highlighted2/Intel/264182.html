An Apple Mobile GPU Is A Sensible Route Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple is working on a proprietary GPU rumors suggest It would make sense because Apple could improve its profit margins outsourcing only the production while advancing hardwaresoftware optimization The timing is sensible since competiting graphic solutions are getting on par or better Snapdragon with Adreno looks superior to Apple A Development will take at least a couple of years more since its more difficult than modifying readytouse ARM architectures Taking a look at recent Kantar data and the step back for TV content distribution I rate Apple as a hold and wait for further developments Apple Inc AAPL has always been very strong on the GPU field with its Apple Ax SoCs Apple A is a clear example of what its capable of However there is the opinion that Apple may be working on its own mobile GPUs leaving behind its partnership with Imagination Technologies Fudzilla reported that Apple is working on its own proprietary GPU and it also affirms that Apple has commissioned the next G modem to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>INTC Apple started to heavily customize its SoCs by modifying ARM ARMH architectures with its own developing team This kind of approach permitted Apple to have an upper hand in certain periods by implementing new ARM features before competitors At the same time Apple has been able to customize the ARM cores by building a CPU architecture more suitable to run iOS In this way Apple is able to obtain high efficiency good performances and lowpower consumption with a very high optimization level Qualcomm Inc QCOM took a similar route in the past with its Krait cores and its doing the same with its new Kryo cores implementing them in a bigLITTLE form factor a couple of high performance Kryo cores and a couple of low power Kryo cores Such an approach would have been far less efficient with the ARM A high performance cores The development of custom Kryo cores look to be quite successful since a single Kryo performs very similarly to a single Apple Twister core against in Geekbench single core Even Samsung OTCSSNLF is going to release its first custom ARM architecture with its own Mongoose M leaked benchmarks show that a Mongoose core is only slightly slower than Twister and Kryo it scores in Geekbench single thread Creating a new GPU architecture instead is something completely different than customizing an already present CPU architecture That is what Apple and Samsung have been doing for years The fact that rumors concerning Apples GPU are spreading recently it may be the sign that some improvement has been carried on But what would be the positive of using a proprietary GPU architecture First of all Apple could improve its own profit margins since it could cut off its GPU licensing from Imagination Technologies and it could send it directly to foundry partners We are not talking about relevant profit improvements because Imagination Technologies generates revenues for million from royalties and million from licensing this implies that the profit improvement could only reach the order of tens of millions of dollars from this point of view Other savings could be achieved by optimizing and reducing the SoC area occupied from the GPU in order to reduce the SoC foundry production cost given that Apple SoCs cost around billion per year such a reduction cost must be quite below billion Other than profits the most important reason to project an Apple GPU is the softwarehardware optimization We have seen how the mere ARM CPU customization has provided high optimization levels with iOS therefore projecting an entire GPU architecture could be even more advantageous Apple has created the Metal APIs that could be exploited even better with a specific Apple GPU architecture providing consistent improvements and energy efficiencies Another important factor which could push Apple to develop its own GPU architecture is competitors solutions Qualcomm has provided its phablet developer board for Snapdragon which is powered by the Adreno The results are extremely good from the graphic point of view since its able to beat Apple A in GFXbench while it is on par in D Mark This is a situation that we have seen even with the Snapdragon against the Apple A but SD got a lot of heat issues that look to have been solved with SD This implies that performance must be roughly equal once throttling kicks in if it kicks in while SD was behind by with longterm performances with Xiaomi Mi Note Pro Even Samsung is well set with its Exynos powered by Mali T MP leaked benchmarks show performances similar to Adreno achieving very good results A similar behavior was seen for Exynos this year but at the same time it showed off very consistent CPU performance with heavy throttling for what concerns the GPU the longterm GFXbench performance test demonstrated that Exynos in Galaxy S Edge Plus deteriorates graphic performances even by a very bad result Its known that Mali T has great architectural and layout improvements compared to Mali Txx but its to be seen if longterm performances will be consistent enough to meet competitors scores In any case its quite clear that Apples competitors are heavily accelerating on the GPU performance field therefore this could push the Cupertinos company to implement some proprietary projects That Apple is working on a proprietary GPU is likely to be true and I personally think that it will still take two or three years to see its implementation if it will be convenient enough This route will not provide a relevant profit margin increase but it will help optimize the hardwaresoftware ecosystem to a level that is not attainable with thirdparty intellectual properties its well known how the hardwaresoftware optimization is important the Apple ecosystem At the same time Apple got stuck and temporarily retreated from TV content subscription which is quite a hole in the Apple TV strategy Its still to be seen if Apple will provide iTunes movies with HEVC and K resolution with the Skylake update even with an Apple TV which has no HW codec to run such videos at K and its HDMI port cannot sustain K content at fps or if it will wait for the next Apple TV update Finally as you can see in another article that Im going to release if we take a look at Kantar data for October it looks like Apple will really see low singledigit growth for the iPhone in Q Given this scenario I rate Apple as a hold and I highly recommend to wait
