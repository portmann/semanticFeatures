</span>reported earnings that beat by a share Analysts pointed out the beat was greatly helped by the effective tax rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC reported earnings after the close on July th that beat street estimates by a share vs estimated for Q There was an article explaining that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made most of its beat from having an effective tax rate of only This got me interested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and I noticed Intels inventory level also helped the companys earnings I gathered the data from ADVFN and Intels K SEC filing COGS Beginning Inventory Purchases Ending Inventory Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reports COGS with depreciation added in on its report to the SEC I simply subtracted depreciation from Intels reported COGS to arrive at the COGS determined by Intels beginning inventory purchases made during the quarter and level of the ending inventory When the quarter starts a companys COGS will be determined by the amount of purchases and ending inventory An investoranalyst can determine the amount of purchases in each quarter by backing into the figure with algebra Purchases Ending Inventory COGS Beginning Inventory Lets look at the levels of Intels inventory and purchases compared with company sales over time I also have added the three components of total inventories raw materials work in progress and finished goods Source ADVFN Intels SEC filing and authors calculations One sees that Intels ending inventory level is high historically since the last business cycle low <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does have some seasonality in its ending inventory so heres a table showing the figures below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is currently holding the second highest ending inventorysales ratio since the last business cycle low The high amount of inventory on Intels balance sheet in Q did not reward investors for the rest of that year Stacy J Smith Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President our prediction for Q was that inventory levels would be taken down fairly significantly which is unusual in a Q What we actually saw in the second quarter is inventory levels did come down but theyre kind of at normal And so what youre seeing now in Q is a little bit of a pipeline fill based on inventory levels that came down in Q against the backdrop of Qs that normally would have inventory levels going up So its the same phenomenon of some shift of billings from Q to Q Its just much more muted than what we thought a quarter ago Christopher B Danely Citigroup Global Markets Inc Broker you said that your PC forecast has gone down from I guess to down high single digits One question on that is on your inventory have you adjusted your inventory to I guess increase the server products and decrease some of the PC processors And can you give us a sense of where you expect inventory to trend in the second half of the year Stacy J Smith Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Sure Its less driven by server and more driven by the mix of Skylake on nanometer And so what happened in Q is that as you can see dollars went up but units were down and actually down a bit more than we had expected when we started the quarter But the mix of the units that are in inventory have shifted from nanometer products to nanometer And within nanometer were starting to see the shift from Broadwell to Skylake And so its a more expensive product because its brand new Its also the newest product which gives me a lot of comfort about whats sitting in inventory As we play out through the rest of the year what we expect to happen is that units will continue to come down from here nanometer comes down the cost curve but the inventory shifts even more dramatically from Broadwell to Skylake And so when I take those three trends into account Im predicting that well end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today not dramatically different But again units will be down dollars will be flat Stacy J Smith Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Remember last quarter what we were expecting was a substantial burn of inventory And the way we articulated that our belief was that customers would burn off inventory levels in advance of Windows and then replenish inventory levels in the third quarter What we actually saw was much more normal than that We saw customers maintain inventory levels I think their confidence in the overall PC market grew some as they worked through the quarter and got towards the end of the quarter So I had articulated we have relatively normal inventory levels now We expect relatively normal inventory levels in the third quarter Historically you see inventory build some in the third quarter in anticipation of the Q selling season Q acknowledged that the revenue is at the higher end of the seasonal range The point we were making earlier is we think the market is pretty seasonal but we saw an unusual inventory depletion in Q We think some of that inventory fill has just shifted into Q So theres a little bit of a billing shift Its not a lot Its maybe a couple of points at the top line Q I think you have to be a little careful with the math about implied I think if you just assume weve said on the call were expecting Q to be roughly seasonal And I think if you plug that in youre still rounding to the number that I gave you for the year An <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>executive said What we actually saw in the second quarter is inventory levels did come down but theyre kind of at normal and Im predicting that well end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today not dramatically different But again units will be down dollars will be flat Now does the executive mean normal as a level or a percentage of sales or expected sales Heres a table of the growth in ending inventory compared to Q for each year since Inventory Level Change from Q to Q One can surmise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is betting on nm chips to make this years earnings with work in progress inventory at an alltime high both as a percentage as sales shown in first chart and nominally Source ADVFN and Intels SEC Filing The question then becomes how much did inventory sitting on the balance sheet while purchases remained subdued help Intels earnings this quarter I created this table so that the analystinvestor can decide for themselves what the appropriate level of inventory is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in their mind and how it impacted earnings However dont forget about the effective tax rate being a one off low rate of dont think politicians will let that last Historically for the last five fiscal years one finds that the average effective tax rate is If one then does pro forma analysis to both the ending inventory level and tax rate at the historical level of vs one comes up with the following table of EPS levels Source ADVFN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SEC filing and authors calculations Intels earnings forecast was a share going into the announcement But we see that if the average historical tax rate was used then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would have actually made only a share A clean miss One also can see how the inventory switchover from nm to nm chips helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in this quarter But has this high level of inventory only pulled a little bit forward some of Intels earnings Remember Im predicting that well end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today not dramatically different But again units will be down dollars will be flat And the formula for COGS COGS Beginning Inventory Purchases Ending Inventory Im not planning to buy a new computer because of nm chips or Windows Maybe some high frequency traders and gamers will but does the average Internet user really need a new computer I think most consumers are more interested in the next Apple product or gaming app The algorithmic trading machines bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock on the press release but savvy investors sold the stock to them I expect investors wanting alpha will do the same in the future PS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
