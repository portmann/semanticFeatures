class='textDiv'>Ongoing Execution Will Be Mellanoxs Best Argument Against The Bears Mellanox Technologies Ltd NASDAQMLNX Seeking Alpha Ongoing beatandraise performance hasnt been enough to quite concerns that Intels OmniPath will grab significant highend interconnect share from Mellanox particularly once it is fully integrated with the processor Mellanox continues to move forward with faster interconnect speeds and G has climbed to over of sales while EZChip creates longrun integrationcrossselling opportunities Mellanox seems fairly valued on the basis of longterm revenue growth and FCF growth but these shares often give patient investors a second chance at a better valuation If companies like Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA EMC NYSE EMC and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT are right about the growth potential in highperformance computing highend storage and data centers over the next three to five years Mellanox NASDAQ MLNX should do pretty well for itself selling its highend Infiniband and Ethernet connectivity switches boards and cables <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC remains a looming risk with its integrated OmniPath offerings but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has had its issues before with overpromising what it could deliver with integration and Mellanox has a pretty solid hold of the high end of the market Matters with Mellanox have developed largely in line with my expectations when last I wrote as revenue was about higher than Id modeled and FCF was about better I wasnt overly impressed with the valuation then and the shares did fall about at the worst point while a strong recent rally has them close to above where they traded back in May At this point Im still pretty ambivalent on the valuation I can see outperformance with EZChip integration and crossselling driving better results as well as increased adoption of G Infiniband but data center spending can be volatile and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has enough credibility to be viewed as a serious threat to Mellanox Doubledigit revenue and FCF growth assumptions support a mids fair value in my model which isnt enough to get me excited about it as a new buy A lot of ink is spilled on the question of whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will really grab a meaningful share of the market from Mellanox through its new G and beyond OmniPath offerings Theres been ample squabbling back and forth with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>claiming that it outperforms Mellanox and Mellanox claiming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been moving the goalposts and that its that is Mellanoxs offload architecture is a superior approach given that it uses the NIC instead of the CPU to move data How much that latter point matters remains to be seen Mellanox management noted during its last Analyst Day that data centers use over half of their CPU capacity to move data and only for app processing One of the rebuttals to that is that multicore processors can get around the need for offloading but then Intels past efforts to integrate functions have not always lived up to their promised performance advantages and that could prove to be true here as well Its also worth noting that Mellanox has repeatedly noted that itll be on to G by the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is really ready for prime time with G The rebuttal here is that the demand for G is unlikely to develop fast enough for that to truly matter not many customers truly need or can make such full use of G that they really need that kick up to G To some extent this reminds me a little bit of the Cavium NASDAQ CAVM versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>arguments and I sometimes wonder if the two sides are really talking past each other Cavium and Mellanox arent targeting the mass market everyman markets and Mellanox generates the lions share of revenue from products with speeds above G that are well beyond the needs of most enterprises Acquisitions are pretty common in this space Broadcom BRCM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and many others have been serial acquirers over the years and have relied on RD to supplement and in some cases replace their internal RD efforts Mellanox certainly belongs on that list given its MA history Volatire Kotura IPtronics Integrity Project and Xloon and the company has used these deals to acquire a variety of capabilities across silicon boards cables and software in both Infiniband and Ethernet It went back to the well in a big way with the acquisition of EZChip an million cash deal that cost more than Mellanoxs prior deals put together A fabless chip company EZChip focuses on highperformance chips for data center cloud and carrier network applications sold by OEMs like Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and ZTE About threequarters of the business is in network processing units alternatives to the ASICs and FPGAs sold by Broadcom and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that offer good priceprogrammability tradeoffs and the rest is in multicore CPUs and network adapters All told EZChip should bring valuable capabilities in security deep packet inspection and specialized processing video and storage as well as a set of addressable market verticals and customers that Mellanox hasnt done much business with in the past Paying almost five times forward revenue Mellanox has to make sure this deal goes well The technology that it is getting certainly explains the companys interest but paying its way into more headtohead competition with the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Broadcom and Cavium is not without some risks Can Mellanox Leveraging FastGrowing Markets Management believes it is serving highgrowth markets and it is hard to argue given the recent run of results seven straight quarters of doubledigit yoy revenue growth the weakest of which was up While the projected market growth rates that Mellanox offered at its October Analyst Day only go out to the prospect of growth across switches adapters and optical cables is nevertheless attractive Theres a whole ecosystem predicated on strong growth in spending fromon data centers Web and cloud and Mellanox needs that growth to support the story While a billion addressable market centered largely around highperformance computing has been more than enough to get the company to this point its going to take growth in areas like storage and cloudWeb to help take the company further Its also going to take ongoing highlevel execution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may not be the nearterm threat to Mellanox that it wants to believe it is but Intels resources are too formidable to discount completely and Mellanox has to stay on its toes If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>decides to try to establish OmniPath by pricing it aggressively it will only up the pressure on Mellanox to deliver a priceperformance equation that makes sense for its targeted customers That said high performance demands should work in Mellanoxs favor given the concentration of its market in highvalue highperformance computing and the fact that interconnect is about of the cost of a highperformance installation customers may not be willing to tradecompromise critical performance for cost savings on onefifth of the cost base Im looking for Mellanox to generate about annualized longterm revenue growth with nearterm year growth closer to Im also looking for it to exceed FCF margins in and reach the mids supporting longterm FCF growth of Discounted back that supports a fair value of today As a stress test Id note that the companys trailing revenue and FCF per share growth rates are both around over the past decade I am also expecting ROICs consistently in the midteens over the next few years that comfortably clear my estimated cost of equity Timing is everything with a stock like Mellanox back in January or February this would have probably been a straightforward long idea Now its not so simple I like Mellanoxs business and I think the threat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is overplayed but I am not going to pretend that a longterm forecast of annualized FCF growth is easily achieved The good news is that these shares seem to routinely post pullbacks that give patient investors a chance to reload At this point Im more inclined to wait for one of those freakouts than chase the shares today Disclosure I amwe are long BRCM EMC I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
