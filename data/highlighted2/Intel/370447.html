Vuzix About To Do A Deal With Samsung Vuzix Corp NASDAQVUZI Seeking Alpha A potential deal surrounding Vuzix waveguide technology began to take shape over the past several weeks Surprisingly over the last week I received confirmation that a Korean based OEM was in the Rochester NY area evaluating waveguides I have reason to believe Vuzix NASDAQ VUZI and Samsung OTCSSNLF are on the verge of consummating an augmented reality supply deal for holographic waveguides that will be produced by Vuzix A potential deal surrounding Vuzix waveguide technology began to take shape over the past several weeks Since the beginning of I have heard various and seemingly continuous Vuzix chatter related to a possible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC buyout as well as a potential OEM deal with an unnamed company At the end of the day I dont expect a buyout from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at these price levels but I am leaving the door open for another strategic investment from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at a much higher price level to fund the initial commercial waveguide rollout However much to the dismay of investors there has no updates provided by Vuzixs management team and the chatter began to dissipate Surprisingly over the last week I received confirmation that a Korean based OEM was in the Rochester NY area evaluating waveguides As many of you know Vuzix is based in Rochester NY and moved into a new square foot manufacturing facility during the fall of CES came and went in January without the fanfare that was expected to arrive when Vuzix showed off the companys waveguides to the public for the very first time Instead of demonstrating the waveguides to the public Vuzix CEO Paul Travers decided to demo working prototypes of the companys waveguides behind closed doors to interested third parties Paul Travers confirmed during a recent interview that the company showed working prototypes of the companys waveguides behind closed doors to various interested third parties so this indeed is not speculation on my part and is indeed a fact Vuzix filed an S in early February which I believe provided Vuzix with financial leverage and is a precursor for another round of strategic investment from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or Vuzixs first OEM partner I will make the case in this article is Vuzixs first OEM partner will be Samsung Electronics based in South Korea based on Samsungs internal waveguide presentations patent filings as well as a recent day trip to Rochester NY by a Korean based OEM During the Q conference call Vuzixs management team indicated the companys intent to have waveguides inside of Vuzix products as well as various OEM partners in and the future The real question is how close is Vuzix to landing the companys first OEM partner and which OEM will have the first dance It will be operational soon and will be capable of producing millions of waveguides annually for not only Vuzixs products but also the various OEM partners that we anticipate it may go in through in the future Paul Travers Vuzix CEO during the Q CC The Wall Street journal published Intels augmented reality story last Wednesday I was disappointed that Vuzix was not named in the article after my extensive discussion surrounding Vuzixs IP and products with Don Clark of the Wall Street Journal However I was pleasantly surprised that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is moving forward with an augmented reality device According to the article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely offer the headset design to other manufacturers rather than market its own model to endusers One person briefed on Intels headset plans said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is collaborating with Microsoft for the project The real question at this point is how will Intels decision to move forward with an augmented reality device impact Vuzix First off I think it is important to understand why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>invested m in Vuzix to begin with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>invested in Vuzix to put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside Vuzixs products but the real reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>invested in Vuzix was to advance the waveguide manufacturing process and to leverage augmented reality OEM partners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a unique position to open doors for Vuzixs waveguide technology as well as insuring that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips make it inside as many augmented reality hardware devices as humanly possible A fair question everyone might have is what does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>know about making waveguides My honest answer is that I have no idea what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>knows about making waveguides but I can say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some of the most innovative and advanced silicon technology in the world I can also tell you that a key ingredient to deliver surface relief grating NYSE SRG waveguides is using silicon wafer tools According to Vuzixs Q conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is helping Vuzix with the companys next generation products from the prospective of silicon Theres going to be great opportunities for Vuzixs to open up business through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and on the flipside of the coin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is helping us with some of our next generation technology from the perspective of silicon in the likes Paul Travers Vuzix CEO Q CC For the record Vuzixs waveguides are best suited for augmented reality because the form factor is much more important than the virtual reality space Virtual reality devices are fully immersive so there is no need to be fashionable at this point Microsoft is also very familiar with Vuzixs patented waveguide technology which increases the odds that Microsoft could be a potential OEM for Vuzix Microsoft has been rumored for several years as a possible suitor of Vuzixs waveguides Microsoft also possesses a license for the same SRG waveguide technology used by Vuzix through Nokia The NY Post first reported Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT being linked to Vuzix in June in a story focused on the development of smartglasses by Microsoft and Samsung Microsoft has had dealings with publicly traded Vuzix Corp of Rochester NY which develops technology around scifilike glasses another source said Source NY Post June Over the last week I have been tracking down a report that a Korean based on OEM was in Rochester NY last week for days evaluating waveguides I can confidently confirm that the report is indeed valid however the name of the company and the specific details of the visit were not made available to me The only Korean based companies that would be interested in augmented reality and Vuzixs waveguides include Samsung and LG While searching for a connection between Vuzix Samsung and waveguides I came across an augmented reality presentation from Samsung dated February The presentation was put together by Samsung RD Institute Russia which discusses opportunities in augmented reality as well as the use of holographic display and waveguides In July Samsung filed a patent for a wearable smartglasses headset that is set to feature a holographic display according to Slash Gear What is more interesting is that the schematics provided in Samsungs February presentation are identical to the holographic waveguide images provided in research report published by Opinvent As you can see from the last two images Samsungs schematics that confirm a incoupling hologram as well as a outcoupling hologram which are associated with holographic waveguide At this point I have confirmation that a Korean based company presumably Samsung spent three days reviewing waveguides in the same city Vuzix is located I have demonstrated Samsungs intrinsic interest in holographic waveguides through internal presentations which are also supported by recent patent filings related to smart glasses The only question that remains open that can link Samsungs needs to Vuzix is determining if Vuzix as the IP and ability to produce holographic waveguides In a March interview with Mashable Vuzixs CEO Paul Travers addressed the topic of holographic waveguides and his companys intent of pursuing the technology in earnest Travers says holographic waveguide optics where light is squeezed into a window in front of the eyes and then released to create the image have the most promise and Vuzix is pursuing the technology in earnest March Mashable In a October interview with Optics Org a former Vuzix executive went into length describing Vuzixs system including passive and dynamic holographic waveguides that are now covered by a range of patents Development of the system and of passive and dynamic holographic waveguides now covered by a range of patents included a license agreement with Nokia for its Exit Pupil Expanding NYSE EPE technology related to the critical twodimensional expansion of the image In April Vuzix acquired two additional patents related to gesture control and managing ambient light for an undisclosed sum These two patents added to Vuzixs patents and patent pending total which strengthened the companys IP within the wearable technology space Vuzix acquired these additional patents to secure a stronger IP position for its current and soon to be released products including but not limited to smart glasses based on our proprietary waveguide technology This is just one element of our longterm approach to staying ahead of the curve in this dynamic sector Paul Travers Vuzix CEO Now lets fast forward to March Vuzix has been working closely will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for over a year and based on clues provided during conference calls as well as understanding the waveguide manufacturing process we can gather that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is providing silicon expertise to help Vuzix master the waveguide manufacturing process Intels silicon mastery will allow the company to assist Vuzix with the silicon etching process required to perfect SRG waveguides that will eventually make their way onto the headmounted displays worn by millions of consumers For the first time in the companys history that I can recall the balance sheet is plush with cash A new square foot manufacturing facility that is capable of producing to million holographic waveguides a year is now open for business Over the past week a Korean based OEM spent days evaluating waveguides within spitting distance of Vuzixs manufacturing facility which limits the choices down to Samsung and LG Not only has Samsung been linked to the Vuzixs geographical location but the company has been eyeing holographic waveguides for augmented reality for quite some time In my opinion a three day trip is more than enough time to perform due diligence of Vuzixs manufacturing facility and waveguides For this reason I believe Vuzix and Samsung are in advanced stages of finalizing a deal or have already completed a deal and are working on detailed design for Samsungs first set of holographic waveguides As far as timing goes I believe a deal between Vuzix and Samsung could be announced as soon as the Q conference call which should be scheduled no later than April Editors
