ARM Holdings plc ARMH Includes AAPL GOOG INTC MSFT SSNLF by Mark Hibben ARM Holdings Q earnings confirmed the continuing growth of the ARM ecosystem ARM continues to benefit from the paradigm shift away from commodity processors to custom processors based on ARM IP Apple pioneered the new paradigm and grew rich on the strength of iPhone and iPad sales ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH earnings highlighted robust yy growth in revenue operating income and ARM device shipments This stood in stark contrast to the overall trends in the PC industry Most importantly ARMs smartphone revenue was up based on unit shipment increases as well as higher unit value ARM noted that smartphones are transitioning to bit ARM V faster than expected and this will make it even more difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC to break into this market In ARMs conference call analysts expressed some surprise at the continuing growth of the ARM ecosystem and smartphone growth in particular Based on assumptions about slowing growth in China as well as the overall slowdown in unit growth for the smartphone market it was assumed that this would negatively impact ARMs revenue and earnings No such negative impact was in evidence ARMs Q revenue in dollars was up yy to million Operating profit was up yy to million ARM device shipments on which ARM collects royalties rose to billion units a yy increase Most importantly the processor royalties were up on the strength of the transition of the industry to the bit ARM V architecture which provides a higher royalty rate per chip Uptake of the V architecture has been faster than even ARM predicted ARM management originally thought the uptake of V would be of smartphones by years end but its already at for smartphones ARM now expects it to be by years end This is good news for Apple NASDAQ AAPL in the sense that it validates Apples decision to introduce the worlds first bit smartphone processor in the iPhone s back in I still get questions regarding the value of bit processing and why its of value for a smartphone Its a tough question to answer without getting too technically detailed In a rather general simplified way it represents a way to increase processing throughput without increasing clock rate Data can be processed and moved around within the chip in bit chunks rather than bit chunks The speed improvement can be as great as but usually is less depending on the specific operation The designers of ARM chips are up against a clock rate limitation thats even more severe than for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>based PCs due to the need to limit power consumption Given this limitation the move to bit was a logical way to improve performance without sacrificing battery life Thats why it has become so popular in smartphones Of course Apple faces greater competition going forward ARM noted that bit combined with multiple core often octacore processors are moving into the mid tier and low end of the smartphone market But ARM also noted the bifurcation of the smartphone market into the high end Apple Samsung OTCSSNLF and the rest of the smartphone industry that TSMC made note of in their earnings call As Ive pointed out Apple is on its third generation A bit smartphone system on chip SOC and continues to lead in performance Apples custom designed SOCs continue to lead the pack especially for ARM SOCs that use ARM generic designs such as the Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon the mainstay for current highend Android and Windows Phone devices This SOC performance advantage combined with Apples superior integration of its mobile operating system and superior hardware design and quality will assure that Apples leadership position is secure for the time being And its worth noting that ARMs results dont convey a dramatic slowdown in China at least not at the high end of the market where Apple reigns supreme The other aspect of ARMs report that reflects well on Apple is that ARM is seeing the broad industry trends that I have been pointing to as the paradigm shift away from the commodity processor to the custom SOC ARM has played a pivotal role in this move as the purveyor of CPU and GPU designs that can be used to create these custom SOCs In the conference call ARM made note of trends that bear on the paradigm shift First ARM noted the ongoing consolidation in the traditional commodity semiconductor industry But even as the traditional semiconductor company customer base shrinks device OEMs are starting to take up the slack by acquiring ARM licenses of their own This is confirmation that the custom SOC paradigm is starting to take hold among other device OEMs beyond Apple and Samsung An analyst also asked if ARM sees a move beyond the smartphone to content creation devices as ARM processors become more powerful ARM management confirmed that they do see this trend and gave as an example Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Pixel C Android in device ARM sees this as an ongoing trend Companies such as Apple Google and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT are all taking advantage of this trend to field more capable tablets and hybrid tabletlaptop devices While the ARMbased devices are not yet as capable as their Intelbased counterparts they offer greater mobility battery life and light weight In this space Apple also is in a leadership position by virtue of the iPad Pro Microsofts ARM based Surface tablet isnt really as capable Even as Apple continues to lead the new paradigm shift and benefit from it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to resist it To the extent that it does so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has turned itself into a semiconductor Luddite that stands in the way of innovation Intels tablet and smartphone devices are so inferior to current offerings from Apple and Samsung that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has only been able to gain market share at the very lowest end of the market In tablets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has had to buy its way into the market by selling its processors below cost Intels current product roadmap calls for its SoFIA smartphone chips to be made on its own nm process next year Currently they are made on a nm TSMC process that is two generations behind the current state of the art in ARM processors But innovation in the ARM ecosystem is now so fast that even when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>moves SoFIA to nm it wont be enough At the high end of the market Apple Samsung and Qualcomm will all offer higher performance At the low end of the market companies such as Mediatek will have SOCs that are faster and cheaper <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>simply has no way to pump more life into the x architecture where mobile is concerned As ARM devices become more powerful while maintaining their cost advantage they will continue to drain consumer and enterprise dollars away from the traditional PC market This trend which started with the first iPad will only accelerate Every quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>predicts that the PC market will stabilize This is wishful thinking In the Internet of Things IoT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has claimed some growth and conveys to investors that a huge IoT opportunity awaits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The massive volume of non mobile device ARM chip production approximately billion of the billion devices ARM reported shipped for Q belies this For the vast majority of IoT applications the lower cost of ARM chips makes them a better choice ARMs stock has been in the doldrums for the past year but got a nice pop following the earnings report Its clear that the perceived threat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had much to do with this as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mounted its tablet and smartphone initiatives Part of the surprise of analysts may have derived from the expectation that Intels efforts would be more effective Im not surprised As readers of my past articles on ARM will realize Ive been a longstanding champion of the platform and its most prominent beneficiary Apple ARM and Apple have been at the forefront of the new SOC paradigm As the paradigm shift gains momentum ARM and Apple most stand to benefit ARM continues to be highly valued in terms of PE However I doubt that the stock will slide any more than it has Now is probably the best opportunity for investors to buy ARM Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US
