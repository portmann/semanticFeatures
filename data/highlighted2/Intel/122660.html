expectations going into the year Im starting to retract those expectations based on comments from management and an underwhelming outlook PCCG substantially underperformed this year Based on the comments from management its likely to swing a full percentage points into the negative this year Furthermore the remaining segments couldnt offset the negatives from a contracting PC market I dont think PC volumes will recover in the back half based on Brians comments on inventory Therefore Im slashing my price target from to Im lowering my recommendation to a hold The stock might recover following the investor meeting in Q of This is going to be the hardest article I write about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC as I had a lot of conviction going into the year about the companys underlying fundamentals future growth potential and capital program Of course one thing after another Things eventually unraveled as the company pursued acquisitions that werent popular among the shareholder ranks PC market contracted in and the enterprise segment and mobile didnt generate enough growth to offset the negatives As a result of these factors Im lowering my price target a little more this year Im starting to realize that while the stock could recover on better than expected earnings over the next two quarters theres little reason to believe that the beats will come from topline surprises Therefore my expectations have been lowered even further after having already lowered my estimates in the prior quarter Based on the comments from the management team I have reconstructed my estimates for the various segments PCCG will contract by yearoveryear and DCG will grow by Both segments generate high profit margins but the bad from PCCG cant be offset by the good from DCG this year The remaining segments will grow but at a more modest mid singledigit growth rate this year Revenue is going to contract by approximately unless if PC volumes pickup in the back half of the year Brian Krzanich CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>from earnings conference call While our overall billings roughly matched our forecast PC supply chain inventories declined at a slower rate than we expected as PC demand weakened further While we are expecting a seasonal second half were now forecasting total revenue to decline by about for the full year down from our prior expectation of approximately flat Initially my expectations were high but in the most recent earnings conference call Brian mentioned that inventory isnt clearing from the channels all that effectively Replacement demand is likely to be offset by excessive inventory in various retail channels If anything newer PCs are going to compete with older PCs that are priced a little cheaper Those older PCs will come with a free upgrade to Windows Therefore theres little incentive for consumers to pay for Skylake when they can get by on Haswell parts Based on the expense guidance and the inclusion of a lower effective tax rate I believe EPS is going to remain flat yearoveryear The EPS figure could perform slightly better if in the event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to close the Altera deal prior to yearend and is able to combine Altera earnings with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings In that case scenario I see the stock trading at with EPS of However if Altera deal isnt closed by the end of the year then the EPS figure will come in at around Therefore my EPS range is to Furthermore my price target range is to Currently the stock is trading at around fair value according to my estimates Therefore the stock isnt going to move much higher and isnt going to drop any further I wouldnt be surprised if the stock consolidates into a sideways pattern up until the fall investor meeting where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will go over nextyear earnings and sales growth estimates Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to squeeze out a couple costs pertaining to mobile sustains NAND memory growth and DCG performs inline the stock will find support in the low s Given the weak outlook and the need for more time to realize growth in investment principal Im lowering my rating on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>from
