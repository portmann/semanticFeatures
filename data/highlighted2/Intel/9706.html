computing made possible by the advancement and evolution of Moores law More focus is needed on partnering with PC OEMs to market current products and surprise us with new product launches Disappointment is widespread that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC management did not accurately forecast a decline in desk top sales to the tune of m in a quarter some sales drop was also related to reduced inventories of laptop products I look forward to hearing more about this decline and steps to address the decline at the April <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings conference call When I first got involved in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mid I quickly realized that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a complicated beast of a company The list of products divisions and platforms is huge Getting comfortable with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>took awhile As I studied <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I began to understand its current structure and strategy Basically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides technology end to end from the data center to PCs to phones to wearables to IoT All of these platforms build on each other and support each other All use Intels IP across multiple platforms All use Intels fabs across all platforms The IP developed for one platform is used in other platforms The fab technology is used across all platforms This multiple platform use of IP and fabs provides huge economies of scale Each of the platforms support the other platforms For example the breadth of the fab use across all platforms reduces RD and production costs for new nodesfor all platforms Another example increased sales in IoT products will support lower unit costs in data centers as well as greater demand for data center capacity The multiple platform IP and fabs not only support lower costs the multiple platform IP and fabs also support increased demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products Some of that demand is caused by increased need for computing and storage and some results from better technology and lower costs as costs decrease and technology improve new products create greater demand for more new products In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Data Center Group DCG sales accounted for of Intels profits Given the plus growth in DCG growth and the reduced desk top sales DCG now probably accounts for of all Intels profits These DCG profits now and in the future would not be possible without PCs phones wearables and IoT I have read many people writing that other companies have their sights on data center sales and that other companies have products targeted at data center sales When I target shoot with a rifle setting my sights on a bulls eye or targeting my gun on a bulls eye does not come close to guaranteeing that I will shoot even near the target It takes many years of practice to be an expert at hitting your mark <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has many years of experience in meeting the changing needs of data centers Some competition is good at keeping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on its toes and keeping regulators away while assuring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>customers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is providing good value to data centers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Now Making up for Missing Mobile Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>missed that Moores Law <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is driving and allowing computing to be more mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now focused on mobile laptops phones wearables IoT etc and servicing the needs created by these mobile devices with data center offerings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has identified as the year to develop broad mobile IP that will be used across all platforms Intels Skylake will also focus on taking advantage of the mobility allowed by Moores Law advancement and evolution Some people dont think Moores Law should be called a law It is actually an observation that is commonly referred to as a law because it has been shown to be true over and over even as it evolves to refer more generally to the observation that advancements in technology are quickly replaced by new technology that is smaller less expensive and higher performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has done a great job of looking where they want to go and then going there This forward looking skill is seen in their product development I continue to watch for more such developments I want to be surprised when a product is ready to go and I want the competition to be surprised when the product is ready to launch One such launch that I want to be a surprise is the sale of Skylake computers with Windows Stronger Marketing Partnerships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>PC OEMs However looking where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants to go and taking steps to get there is not so evident in the marketing of their current product line A lot more can be done to manage this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>beast in the area of marketing current products for increased sales For example Intels smaller lower power use chips allow laptops to be smaller lighter and have longer lasting batteries with fewer wires to connect to other devices These advancements result in real tangible benefits to businesses and incredible opportunities to market new laptops to businesses Increased marketing partnerships with OEMs would be a great step to increasing laptop sales today This marketing could highlight the best use of Intels current products This marketing partnership with PC OEMs could also be used to make sure that PC OEMs provide high quality products from the start of a new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>product line I realize that in the past I have said that if I felt the need to tell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>how to run the company I would not be invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>However since I am invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>slipped up with their desk top PC forecasting I feel the need to share my thoughts with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management put more emphasis on partnering with PC OEMs to market current products and surprise us with new product launches Some of you may be following my investing drama Heres a brief update I started investing in the stock market in with a k Roth account I became bored with stocks so I focused on options as a faster way to reach my financial goals of accumulating m to retire and travel I found short term options were too risky so I honed in on long term optionssometimes referred to as LEAPS I coined the phrase LEAPS for Fun and Profit I have experienced many huge swings in my k Roth account including k to k to k to k to k to k to k to k to k to k to k current status You get the idea Right now the account is focused on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and RiteAid NYSE RAD RiteAid is currently driving the increases Nearly all of this account is invested in Jan call options which I plan to sell way before January Approximately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>option contracts are held in this account Most at and strike While some have chosen to exit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>options and possibly reenter later this year I retain my options based on my research related to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>strategies and implementation A month ago I thought of my position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>options as sitting comfortably on a four legged chair The four legs of this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chair were increased DCG salesprofits increased salesprofits with SkylakeWindows lower mobile losses and earnings exceeding guidance every quarter in With the fourth leg broken I am now balanced uncomfortably on a three legged chair still sitting on my options click to enlarge The last half of the year will build steam since the lowest quarter of the year is the first quarter and the peak is the fourth quarteralong with the prospect of increased PC sales with Skylake and Windows From Intels Annual Report Seasonal Trends Historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter To get above by January will require a significant increase in earnings With a PE Price to Earnings ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would need annual earnings of about to reach earnings and a PE of would get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to Analyst annual earnings estimates for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>dropped from to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guidance on April will be critical If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still guides to annual growth in sales then earnings of are easily doable To reach earnings of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would need to beat their own guidance by This is possible if they beat guidance for the last three quarters of the year Lots of numbers and reduced hope but still hopeful At the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings conference call on April I will be listening for updates on my four legged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chair Are the remaining three legs intact Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>quickly regrowing its fourth leg like a sea star regrows its limbs Or will I end up sitting on a two legged chair Studies have found that sitting for longer than four hours increases a persons risk of chronic illness including cancer diabetes and heart disease This chair is not meant to be sat in for long periods just a couple of hours at a time The chair creates a slight discomfort as the user has to keep shifting position to keep it stable Sounds like stock options Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Mistakes And
