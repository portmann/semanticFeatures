<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Management Changed Its Tune <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Last week I provided some quick thoughts on why I believe shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC were declining right after earnings It seemed as if Q and guidance was a little light considering the addition of Altera revenues Additionally GAAP guidance for the bottom line seemed well below expectations when considering acquisition expenses Since my article was published before we received the conference call transcript Im back with some further color on the earnings report Interestingly enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management seemed very conservative with some of its projections which is the opposite of what weve seen in recent years Just to be totally transparent the revenue number for Altera in Q is on the order of million so you can kind of do the math from there I will give you kind of in total what we expect for Altera It is a little north of billion in terms of revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working on a week fiscal year with an extra work week coming during Q As Ive discussed previously this will increase revenues a bit for the quarter and year making the companys growth look a little more impressive than it really is However lets take a look at what analysts were expecting for Altera The screen shot above was taken on Monday Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>completed the Altera deal in late December weve seen some slight estimate reductions for Q and Q The full year average has come down from billion However the CEO comments above dont show as much follow through from the acquisition as compared to what analysts were looking for from Altera as a whole especially when considering the extra week When you subtract out the Altera segment Q guidance was weak ExAltera management called for about billion for Q On the day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>completed the acquisition analysts were looking for billion and that average rose to billion by the time the Q report came in On the call management cited caution regarding China early in as a reason why its forecast was not higher Additionally the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>kept the midsingle digit phrase as part of its revenue growth forecast for all of seemed a bit worrisome When looking at this year management is calling for revenue growth in the midtohigh single digits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had billion in total revenue for We know that the extra week and the Altera acquisition will help somewhere in the order of to billion or roughly to of s total Some may wonder why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>kept the midsingle digit part of its forecast This year PC shipments are forecast to not be as weak as they were in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also will have growth coming from the Data Center Group and Internet of Things segments So why not just say high single digits for the revenue growth forecast Well I think management may have learned a lesson Take a look at the following table comparing Intels yearly guidance versus its actual For example the forecast came at the Q report In three of the past four years management was overly optimistic with its initial guidance This caused a number of forecast reductions throughout the years Taking out the two benefits to this years guidance would be flat to low single digits which I think at this point would seem achievable If things go well maybe we only get the high single digits phrasing sometime this year If things dont work out then management can at least say that mid single digits was part of its original guidance I also wanted to revisit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because of Fridays trading When I submitted my prior article for publication Thursday afternoon shares were down about in afterhours trading Add the overall market drop and shares finished down the first sub close since October Back in December I was skeptical of further upside as I thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was worth in the mid s If you add in slightly weak guidance I would say low to mid s is a respectable target so I do see some upside Analysts are even more optimistic with mean and median targets in the mid to high s Additionally investors are now getting a dividend yield of on an annual basis thanks to the dividend raise about basis points more than a Year Treasury In the end managements color on the conference call did seem a bit more conservative than numerical guidance suggested With some fears of a slowing China plus a recent history of being too optimistic management seemed to change its tune While things can obviously change investors are hoping that this conservatism sets up for a guidance raise at some point in Add in the stocks fall on Friday and a decent dividend yield and I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is worth another look Tagged
