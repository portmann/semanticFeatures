slump in PC is good enough smartphone is the new tech the D XPoint Osborne effect various promises of better tech to come investments in future tech a floundering economy Reasons for it thriving in PC is so much better supersmart phone D XPoint spurs new processor purchases new tech arrives autonomous devices drive IoT and DC new tech too good to pass up It is a rainy day in the mountains Im inside at my very old PC contemplating the timing of the future for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC More and more news reports are supporting the notion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to slump in Tech promised by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management in prior years is not ready for mainstream world markets The economy continues to teeter back and forth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making many investments in future tech and the Osborne effect is alive and kicking back My PC is ancient Because of the teetering economy I continue to wait for that promised new tech that is not quite here yet This economy means that many people have a higher bar for spending money on a new PC For now my iPhone satisfies my craving for new tech The new tech that is not quite here includes wireless docking sure it is here for tech nerds we need it for the masses wireless charging same thing no more passwords same thing and natural interface if Siri were my personal assistant Id fire her This new tech takes time to catch on and become mainstream A shift to increasing PC sales requires hugely faster compute ability along with good reasons for why we need that faster compute ability I can see these faster speeds coming along with reasons for needing faster compute ability I am going to wait for either the economy to get better for the PC to be so much easier to use or for the need for faster compute ability to be more compelling Sure there are lots of people and companies that will continue to buy a PC to meet their needs PCs are still a huge part of Intels business and PC demand is not going to fall off a cliff But it will take significant improvements in compute ability and compelling compute needs before the slowing of PC sales turns around It used to be that the PC improvements from year to year were so great that buying a new PC was a necessary event every few years Not so now Now my PC can do what I need it to do and the grass is greener in the future In the future I will buy a new PC Sales will continue to drop in Like many people I enjoy new tech A PC is not cutting it anymore to give me my new tech high My iPhone is the goto source for a new tech high <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to work on getting into the broader mobile movement but is not significantly in the smartphone craze <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making many investments in future tech These include nm silicon IoT wearables Network Function Virtualization D XPoint supersmart phones and autonomous devices All of these investments are necessary and appropriate for the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>However they are a drag on profits especially when sales are slumping I have estimated that the company invests about billion a year in new tech This includes RD facilities to build new tech and employee stock options to encourage new tech The Osborne effect is a term referring to the unintended consequences of a companys preannouncement made either unaware of the risks involved or when the timing is misjudged which ends up having a negative impact on sales of the current product There is no question that the Osborne effect had huge consequences for Osborne Computer Corp as a company bankruptcy The impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales are much more subtle but it is there We see this in people waiting to buy a PC until new tech arrives We are now seeing this effect in the data center as companies delay new processor purchases waiting for SkyLake and then waiting for D XPoint The teetering economy amplifies the impact In a booming economy people and companies are more likely to buy new tech and not think about waiting for the next advancement However in a weak economy the Osborne effect becomes another excuse to wait Do I need to elaborate The economy continues to flounder and teeter back and forth Will it sink The future is uncertain The result is that our purchasing of new tech is subdued This does not rhyme as well as the Zager and Evans chorus lyrics but it is a lot sooner than the year and Intels survival through is not a question PC Improvements and the SuperSmart Phone By the PC should successfully have wireless docking wireless charging no need for remembering passwords should truly be a personal assistant with natural interfaces and we should be able to carry the PC brains in our pocket The PC and smartphone are moving in the same direction from opposite ends of the size spectrum Smartphones started small and are now getting bigger and more computepowerful PCs are getting smaller and less powerhungry The convergence of these two devices will be pretty evident in I call this device the supersmart phone Will the PC side get a bigger market share than the mobile phone side as compute power becomes more important in handheld devices Will the higher compute power of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>system be able to compete against lower power use of ARM The answer to this is complicated and depends on many factors including how fast silicon technology develops how fast software develops how fast the maker world develops compelling applications how fast autonomous devices gain acceptance and how fast Big Data Analytics and High Performance Computing permeate societal improvements Not only will D XPoint generate new profits for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but the new tech is best used by new processors Achieving times faster access to huge amounts of data is a compelling reason to buy D XPoint and the new processors needed to support D XPoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is leading the movement to replace singlepurpose processors in the telephone industry with general purpose processors accelerated and customized on the fly by FPGA technology This revolution will be in full swing in as this technology will be a critical part of achieving G by the end of the decade NPV will be a billionplus business for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Autonomous devices could become a billion business for the company as more and more devices need the superfast computing ability that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides The company is also gearing up to integrate right into the silicon processor the IP needs for autonomous devices By the new tech in mainstream computing devices will be too good to pass up From easy to way cool to incredibly useful to essential to compete the reasons to buy new tech will be compelling and mainstream Going low in stock is not to be sought after as it is in Limbo competitions Then again maybe buying put options would be a way to profit from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>going low The stock touched briefly in and I expect INTC to reach again sometime in as revenues and especially earnings continue to drop I expect this low point to be reached sometime between April and October Doom and gloom for and huge profits for What about What happens to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock in and the last half of will likely be a function of the economy If the economy strengthens and becomes more certain INTC could surge ahead on the promise of new tech late in or in If the economy continues to flounder and teeter then late
