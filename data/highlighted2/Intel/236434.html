winning Samsungs business has been reduced to nil This is driven by recently leaked performance benchmarks which point to the Exynos as a better singlethreaded and multithreaded app processor Qualcomm needs to develop unique technologies to assist OEMs in differentiating handsets to Apple Instead Qualcomm has lost footing in the highend and has emphasized commodity parts for commodity handsets While Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has yet to recover from the disaster that was the Snapdragon the upcoming Snapdragon seems to do a better job addressing performance issues While Samsung OTCSSNLF is working toward building competitive SoCs Im somewhat dubious of the companys ability to sell mobile parts to other OEMs So Samsung isnt a direct competitor to Qualcomm but Qualcomms handset OEMs will likely lose share to Samsungs device lineup as time wears on The vast majority of mobile apps are singlethreaded and performance enhancement primarily comes from improvements at one or two cores In the rare instance you have multithreaded applications the Samsung would have an edge over its rivals However power consumption becomes an issue in this form factor Ideally youd utilize the additional cores through multitasking However smartphones arent really designed for multitasking due to limitations to screen size and lack of functional productivity apps to leverage the compute resources In other words smartphones are still content consumption devices and rarely will you ever multitask or use demanding multithreaded applications So Samsungs design philosophy falls short of Apples NASDAQ AAPL A Twister cores in terms of real world performance In fact I anticipate Apples iPhone s to have both a power and performance advantage when compared to Samsungs Mongoose Sure the tech space is known for both competition and partnership among bitter tech rivals But after having invested such significant resources in prior and currentgeneration SoCs Id be doubtful of Samsungs willingness to share its competitive edge even if it means missing out on direct OEM sales Apple doesnt even share its OS much less its hardware Qualcomm designed its own inhouse thumbprint sensor in response to Apples thumbprint sensor and its years late Apple designed a dualcore CPU for its current tablet and smartphone lineup Qualcomm opted for a quadcore configuration for the Snapdragon The Snapdragon will have two higherclocked cores and two lowerclocked cores The lowerclocked cores are utilized whenever there are serious CPU demands put in place but generally speaking Qualcomm has the best of both worlds when it comes to multithreaded and singlethreaded applications as the two highpowered cores running at Ghz will have better power savings features as opposed to an eightcore CPU Samsungs strategy sort of reminds me of AMDs NASDAQ AMD More cores must equal more power and if AMD cant design more efficient cores or better CPU architecture AMD cranks up the voltage and adds more cores to keep pace with competitors benchmarks In the highend AMDs CPUs draw as much power as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Xeon E E series Likewise Samsungs Exynos will consume more power but in terms of singlethreaded and multithreaded benchmarks the results are pretty astonishing nonetheless The Snapdragon s red bar performance lags behind the Exynos green bar and Apple A purple bar Of course these benchmarks are run on reference handsets so these rankings may change once we see real world performance benchmarks However theres no denying that Qualcomms performance will likely lag the Exynos on both the singlethreaded and multithreaded performance benchmarks when based on preliminary leaks Samsungs performance advantage is very modest on the singlethreaded comparison But for the sake of marketing Samsung finally has a performance advantage when compared to other Android handsets At this point theres zero possibility Qualcomm wins Samsungs business as its app processor and modem are roughly comparable in terms of performance On the other hand the remaining chip providers have inferior CPUs with the obvious exception of Apple and Qualcomm So Qualcomm could take back share from MediaTek as QCOM can move its midtier to lowtier chips to lower pricing levels However the high volume low margin business isnt where the excitement is at Qualcomm needed to build a better chip to win Samsungs business Instead Samsung is wellequipped to design chips inhouse and even has a fab advantage when compared to Apple and Qualcomm So perhaps Samsungs chips will get even better on the singlethreaded performance comparisons in the next generation Perhaps Samsung will eclipse the performance of Apples upcoming A Qualcomms stock returns have lagged against its mobile competitors Yes I refer to Samsung and Apple as competitors because every bit of market share they gain is a loss to the ecosystem that Qualcomm supports Its basically Qualcomms responsibility to come up with new hardware to market to mobile OEMs They havent done that very successfully and youll often see Qualcomm reacting to every handset Apple releases In a year I can see Qualcomm releasing something equivalent to the haptic feedback engine Thats a long time to go without functionality improvements to the Android UI Hence Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has opted to design some of its own components inhouse While Im dubious of Google attempting to build an app processor or modem history has proven that if you commit enough resources its possible to build a better CPUGPU than Qualcomm Hence Qualcomms valueadd comes into question within the mobile ecosystem If anything Qualcomm has to be more integrated into the future design of handsets Maybe they come up with new hardware to keep the Android ecosystem relevant But honestly Im not really banking on that Theyre too focused on building the core components of smartphones and theyre not doing a good job at that either Hence Qualcomm has hung its OEMs as mobile OEMs will likely struggle against Samsung and Apple in this current handset cycle I continue to reiterate my sell recommendation on Qualcomm Editors Note This
