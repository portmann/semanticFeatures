afterhours on Wednesday February as Seeking Alpha has covered here EPS and revenue both beat estimates slightly but investors cheered the massive dividend increase and buyback This article was written in after CSCO announced its dividend increase for that year With the latest increase in mind it is time to rerun the numbers Let us get into the details Ciscos new quarterly dividend of cents per share gives it a current yield of even after the increase in share price afterhours This represents a massive dividend increase of about The companys yield now handsomely beats the yield of two other wellknown old tech stocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC with and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT with At the time of the previous article Ciscos yield was right between Intels and Microsofts Let us look at the dividend coverage using three metrics Payout ratio Ciscos new dividend puts its trailing payout ratio at a comfortable which is more or less in line with Intels and Microsofts Please note that these numbers are based on the current EPS reported on Yahoo Finance Cash on hand It is impossible to talk about CSCO as a potential investment without bringing its cash pile into picture The companys cash and shortterm equivalents make up about of its market cap Granted cash on hand by itself does not reward investors unless it is properly used and that bulk of the billion could be subject to repatriation tax But it is still hard to ignore the glaring cash pile Free cash flow According to YCharts Ciscos lowest quarterly free cash flow in the last five years was billion The current outstanding share count is about billion Multiplying the new current quarterly dividend of cents by the number of shares outstanding we arrive at the billion the company has currently committed to shareholders This is lower than the lowest quarterly free cash flow in five years To summarize dividends appear very safe With the decision to add billion to buybacks Cisco can retire about of its current shares outstanding In the last five years the company retired about of its shares As long as new shares arent issued buybacks have a positive impact on the stock price as EPS increases while also saving the dividend payments Cisco began paying dividends in and the dividend has gone up more than from cents per shareqtr to cents per shareqtr The company is now slowly getting into the pattern that dividend growth investors tend to like a dependable dividend increase around the same time each year Cisco has announced its dividend increases in February the last three years The table below shows the expected fiveyear yield on cost for an investor who buys Cisco at the current level assuming it increases dividend by per year The fiveyear projected yield on cost is up significantly from in the previous article to here This is due to Ciscos generous dividend increases the last two years and this trend is likely to continue over the next few years at least Source Dividend and share price data from Yahoo Finance Earnings are expected to grow at per year for the next five years This appears a little optimistic especially considering the fact that last five years showed an average earnings growth of per year If Cisco manages the same earnings growth organic cost cutting buybacks put together the EPS would be around in five years If CSCO maintains the current payout ratio of investors are looking at an annual dividend of in five years This would represent a increase from the current level In the previous article Cisco had a clear lead over Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in three out of the five categories used below Now things are a lot closer than before with CSCO still maintaining a slender lead overall As good as these numbers look investors should keep in mind that the stock has gone nowhere in the last two years However income investors can expect Cisco to keep them happy with at least a few more years of consistent dividend increases as backed up by the numbers above The biggest problem we have with the company is that organic growth seems to have stopped a long time ago These days the company is looking only at acquisitions and is expected to announce more These typically dont move the needle for a billion giant The new CEO Chuck Robbins has been in the job for about six months and investors will hope that Ciscos stock does a Microsoft Microsofts stock took off a few months after Satya Nadella took over and broke highs it hadnt seen in years While this is not a given each time the idea here is that the market likes to cheer even a slightly differentinnovative move from a new CEO Especially if the old CEO is generally disliked like John Chambers was We believe Cisco is a good addition to a dividend growth portfolio but investors should generally be wary of companies until they prove they will stick to the dividends and increase them through thick and thin This is the main reason the dividend contenders and challengers are well respected as theyve been through many hostile situations while rewarding investors throughout But investors should generally be thankful that there are suddenly quite a few technology stocks with reliable dividends IBM NYSE IBM used to be the only such name but now weve got the likes of Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color:
