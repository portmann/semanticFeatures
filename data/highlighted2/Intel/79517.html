NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Jun PM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation INTC Includes ARMH ATML FSL NXPI STM TXN by Robert Castellano Intels acquisition of Atmel goes beyond the datacenter business The combination of Intels Quark processor and an FPGA will be enhance the companies visibility for thousands of customers making an estimated billion IoT devices in Back in January I wrote an Instablog on Seeking Alpha that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC wasnt moving smart enough in the Internet of Things IoT space I pointed out that microcontrollers MCUs provide local processing capability for the realtime embedded processing of most Smart Technology applications I questioned Intels strategy in Smart Technology particularly since the company dropped out of the top market leaders in and its Quark announced in is an embedded systemonachip SoC processor design intended for competition with ARMs NASDAQ ARMH Cortex M RISCbased processors which are already found in wearable computing like Google Glass and Recon Jet and many mobile phones MCUs when incorporated with a sensor and a wireless connectivity chip into the design of a dumb gadget turns them into smart products For example a toaster is just a dumb device that can only tell you if its on or off According to Kaivan Karimi VP and GM of Atmel Corporations NASDAQ ATML Wireless Solutions business via his companys blog Design an MCU into a toaster oven with a user interface and you can control it in a more predictable and systematic manner It now has become a smart toaster Add the appropriate connectivity and you can now communicate and control that smart toaster remotely And because these devices are sleeping most of the time they benefit from the nonvolatile memory FLASH in many MCUs When the power is off the devices memory retains the content I noted also that MCUs are being designed into Smart Technology by most manufacturers although the majority are ARM based Leading ARM licensees are Atmel Freescale NYSE FSL NXP NASDAQ NXPI STMicroelectronics NYSE STM Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN and Toshiba Freescale has cut back on its ColdFire in favor of ARM Keep in mind that a microprocessor MPU can be used in Smart Technology and are in fact used instead of MCUs in computeintensive applications It is estimated that of all Smart Devices use an MPU Back in mid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>entered into a pilot program known as Smart Cities USA with the city of San Jose CA marking the companys first Smart City implementation in the US The scalability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture enables the intelligence and flexibility necessary for cities across the country to quickly deploy a range of smart city solutions for everything from air and water quality to traffic and parking management to communications systems and other city infrastructure But heres where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>got smart and I changed my thinking They purchased Altera Much of the buzz after the purchase focused on Intels datacenter business The acquisition would enable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to integrate Alteras FPGAs with its Xeon processor enabling customers to magically upgrade the chips over time using software updates Equally important or perhaps more so FPGAs will propel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>into market leadership in Smart TechnologyIoT Two features of FPGAs are responsible First while discussions so far have focused on enabling Intels highend Xeon processors to operate at a x performance coupled with a decrease in cost particularly when the CPU and FPGA are integrated in one package we see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>migrating the technology to the Quark for embedded applications <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be a beneficiary of the acquisition by getting back into the lucrative embedded market for Smart TechnologyIoT At the same time it could impede ARMs momentum in the SMART TechnologyIoT market since Altera markets SOCs using ARMs CortexA and CortexA IP Finally and most importantly the FPGA provides greater flexibility and faster timetomarket for customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>estimates that billion devices will be connected to the Internet of Things by There are thousands of manufacturers of devices that will be connected to Smart TechnologyIoT as diverse as thermostats toasters LED lighting subway systems traffic lights water hydrants and medical imaging systems Whats required is flexibility to incorporate a wide range of standard and userdefined IO interfaces as well as highspeed connectivity to simplify the conversion of simple devices to smart devices The QuarkFPGA platform could be customizable for diverse algorithms and applications Because of its programmability the FPGAs logic can handle specific workloads that can be reconfigured it the workload changes such as a company upgrading its smart device In Smart TechnologyIoT a microcontrollerprocessor is part of a sensor network that is capable of performing some processing gathering sensory information and communicating with other connected nodes in the network along with a transceiver and one or more sensors An ultralow power MCU such as the Quark can have limited compute power in a wireless sensor nodes used in Smart TechnologyIoT applications The FPGA could be used to attain high performance at low power such as processing digital signals while the microcontroller handles communication and control The bottom line for investors is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has positioned itself to sell its processors into the Smart TechnologyIoT marketplace According to The Information Networks report Convergence of Semiconductors and Smart Technology A Market Analysis microcontrollers MCUs used in Smart Cities Smart Homes Smart Industry Smart Health and Smart Transport a subset of the Internet of Things represented just of the overall MCU market in But in billion in MCUs representing of the total market will be used in these applications Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
