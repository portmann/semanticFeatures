dipped with the market in August despite what appeared to be a solid earnings report It prompted me to evaluate Cisco versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been a longstanding Tech portfolio position Tech stocks have a prominent place in my stock portfolio comprising about of the aggregate total Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC are my two current holdings From timetotime I compare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with other large Tech names It provides perspective and may offer a competitive challenge to the original investment thesis Recently I turned my attention to Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO another Old Tech name Shares tumbled after what was perceived to be a very good August earnings release Notably CEO John Chambers turned over the reins to longtime Cisco exec Chuck Robbins Mr Chambers served as CEO for that past years Cisco is the leader in the design and manufacturing of internetbased networking products and related services to the communications and information technology businesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the kingpin of the computer chip business probably moreaccurately expressed as certain digital technology platforms Both tech companies are the undisputed champions of their respective industries Lets begin by doing sidebyside comparisons of some key financial metrics I selected these specific measures as representative and reasonable comps for the two Technology sectors businesses though its recognized <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco operate in differing Technology industries Both corporations own pristine balance sheets Liquidity cash and debt management are excellent Generally trends are stable or improving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco have positive net debt positions though Cisco is unusually cashrich In response to low interest rates and high capex <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management elected to ramp up longterm debt between and Prior to that decision <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco had comparable net debt positions Remarkably nearly half of Ciscos market value is comprised of cash and investments Such a high percentage of balance sheet cash and investment is rare More on this later I point out Cisco carries a relatively high proportion of goodwill and intangibles on its balance sheet This is due to significant MA activity I prefer to see this figure below Edge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco have outstanding balance sheets Perhaps a slight edge to Cisco based on cash However one may question the necessity of holding such high levels of cash and outside investment Again these companies exhibit very strong figures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco command solid RoE returns above marker are considered excellent EBITEV is the hurdle rate reserved for the best corporations both meet this grade too EA is a metric appreciated by the investment great Benjamin Graham A ratio greater than indicates exceptional overall financial strength I favor corporations that earn profits largely in cash Income statements may contain accounting conventions that distort the underlying operation to the positive or negative Comparing profits to operating cash flow offers a clean lineofsight Here we find two Tech titans spinning off loads of cash flow well above comparable earnings Over the past fiscal year Cisco has remarkably generated even more Free Cash Flow than profit This is a function of outstanding OCF coupled with low capex requirements The numbers tell a story but the number are not THE story In a nutshell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been hampered by its legacy slowgrowth PC business and perceived late to the ball foray to the handset market On the other hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>owns the PC chip market as well as the rapidly growing server chip business Upandcoming IoT and NAND nonvolatile memory segments are poised for future growth but are yet too small to move the needle Indeed I concur the traditional PC business is in secular decline though perhaps not as dire as proclaimed by some pundits The demand for desktop and traditional laptop PCs is decreasing Refresh rates are being extended However hybrid form factors ie ins are filling some of the void <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has wellpositioned itself to manage the transition Device form is changing but Im not so sure overall nonhandset device demand is in permanent secular decline Part of this thesis is based on a view the chip market is mature in many ways resembling oldline manufacturing industrial concerns Global economic conditions are a demand driver particularly Asia and emerging markets where more than half of Intels sales originate Today net worldwide growth is weak This leads to reduced demand for new computing devices Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which does of its business offshore has been fighting flagging economies and forex headwinds On the other hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>aimed for and now dominates the server chip market Data Center segment No competitor offers a viable response Accelerating Cloud expansion buttresses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management claims for sustainable midteens growth Turning to the InternetofThings and NAND memory I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will eventually outpace all comers too It may take time but the endgame tilts heavily to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wins Unsurprisingly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management has gravitated to highmargin businesses Perhaps the Company will make meaningful inroads into the handset chip market My opinion is it will do so but not at the expense of a lowend lowmargin endgame Net growth prospects Generally I accept <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management and Street consensus whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will enjoy sustainable mediumterm MSD profit growth Cash flow is likely to exceed profits despite Cloudbased capital investment is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future Topline growth has been flattish for the past years Sales growth and gross margins are integral to the to improved earnings and cash flow equation Cisco Systems legacy business emphasizes internet switches and routers Similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>growth in these product lines is slowing This doesnt belittle the fact that Cisco like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the largest player in its field Lately the Company has attempted to diversify into more software and services a more favorable recurring revenue model Growth and diversification through acquisition has been a primary inroad Cisco management has focused upon the wireless business anticipating a continued data demand explosion This approach appears to have the potential to move revenues and profits in the right direction Nevertheless Cisco management faces similar criticisms that bedevil <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Mr Market cannot shake the fact that flagship switchgear and routers sales arent growing quickly These products do continue to dominate the enterprise Meanwhile weak global economies especially emerging markets and forex headwinds dog earnings though I envision neither issue terminal Quite similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Cisco has and continues to maintain outstanding margins So whats the bottom line growth story The Street indicates Cisco can grow EPS by midsingledigits However the consensus is tempered by fairly divergent views On one hand enterprise spend is expected to improve and with it Ciscos fortunes On the other hand the Company faces several significant risks a great deal of its business is derived from China multiple acquisitions increase integration risk and strong competition in some business lines dont afford Cisco a great deal of pricing power In particular the NSA scandal hurt Ciscos business in China Local officials implicated Cisco a US Corporation as complicit spying allegations In response the Chinese government directed some business transfer to domestic companies The move exacerbated an already tough price war and Cisco has lost market share Good longterm investments are about fine wellrun businesses Its also about purchasing the stock at a discount to fair value On a comparative basis the two stocks exhibit little obvious separation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is cheaper on cash flow Cisco cheaper on operating earnings However after backing out cash and investments the priceearnings ratio plunges to only x In addition Cisco is advantaged when viewed on a PFCF basis This is reasonable since maintenance capex is far lower than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sports a better twoyear PEG ratio though both companies are above the marker This reflects modest earnings growth forecasts Current Street estimates forecast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>growing at a year in and while Cisco is projected to grow EPS at annually through fiscal Pricetosales ratios are about the same Using FAST graphs we can see the historical relationship between price and earnings and price and cash flow I elected to use an year chart in order to align initial price earnings and past forward growth rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock appears undervalued when evaluated by a PE or POCF Accepting earnings estimates and applying a x PE the orange GrahamDodd formula figure below the x historic average we arrive at a fair value estimate I believe shaving another multiple point off that for an additional factor of safety This lowers the projection to The FAST graph highlighting operating cash flow suggests a FV of the historical x PCF multiple isnt aggressive so Im inclined to use the normalized average A blend of the two results yield per share fair value target Thats greater than a recent price excluding dividends Estimated FY earnings per share are forecast to be The historic normalized PE multiple is x The math indicates a FV estimate On cash flow the story is similar a target is the net result although I point out the x PCF trimmed average multiple is appreciably higher than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Nonetheless I accept the higher ratio given Ciscos better free cash flow An blended average of the two figures suggest a fair value of this is higher than the current bid The two Tech giants have long instituted robust share repurchase plans Typically Tech companies distribute generous stock options to execs and employees Nonetheless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco have a demonstrated track record of truly reducing total diluted shares outstanding though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>buyback activity has slowed over the past year or so given high capital requirements and lower free cash flow Both corporations reward investors with good dividends Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock yields Recent share price improvement has caused the yield to fall to this level While the dividend yield is robust versus SP peers the dividend growth rate has flattened out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management ties its payout to of its rolling free cash flow Alternatively a recent drop in share price has increased CSCOs yield to FCF easily covers the cash dividend Cisco directors have raised the payout smartly since initiating dividends in An <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>versus Cisco comparison turned out to be a most interesting exercise offering expected and unexpected results These companies own outstanding franchises possess fortress balance sheets and spin off loads of cash I appreciate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich his recent management shakeup should prove to be a net positive Alternatively Cisco Systems has just moved to new CEO Chuck Robbins I expect the transition from longterm leader John Chambers to be graceful Intels answer to slowing PC chip sales is a pivot to rapidlygrowing server chips its Data Center Group the IoT Internet of Things and NAND flash memory The June announced intent to acquire Altera Corporation NASDAQ ALTR has particular expectations to advance longterm DCG and IoT strategies Cisco management has elected grow beyond stagnant internet switch and router products by driving for recurring revenue streams Emphasis is on software and services multiple small acquisitions help drive the process Turning to share valuation CSCO shares seem to offer more upside than INTC However investors must decide how well either corporation can execute newer growth strategies Looking backward relative share price appreciation has been contingent upon the time frame Over the past years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>share appreciation has outpaced Cisco by a wide margin to Both companies lagged the SP over the same period though dividends helped to close the total return gap However over the past one year CSCO shares have built momentum by outperforming both INTC and the SP benchmark If one owned neither stock CSCO shares seem to have an edge on INTC on relative valuation Those with longstanding positions in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock like me are not likely to be in a rush to swap out However while inclined to retain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock I have a keen eye toward transitioning gradually to Cisco Systems shares An important data point will be upcoming earnings reports <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management has indicated the second half of will see business acceleration Ill be
