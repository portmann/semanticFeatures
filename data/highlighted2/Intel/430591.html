Bloomberg made it clear Apple will allegedly use Intels LTE modems for iPhones headed to ATT and other telcos who support GSM Qualcomm will still supply the modems on iPhones intended for CDMA networks like Verizon The GSM or Groupe Special Mobile standard has worldwide coverage I expect Apple to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modems for use in iPhones headed to Asia and Latin America <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought Via Telecoms CDMA modems assets last year I think its time to buy more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC shares Bloomberg again fortified the persistent rumors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will really provide the LTE modems on some new iPhone models Apple NASDAQ AAPL will allegedly use Intels LTE modems for new iPhones heading to GSM telcos like ATT NYSE T Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM will still supply the modems for CDMA telcos like Verizon NYSE VZ Supplying the modems for ATT iPhones is already a big deal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ATT could sell million iPhones every year At my own guesstimate per modembaseband processor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can receive at least million from ATT iPhones I do not exactly know why Apple is dualsourcing its LTE modems I only care that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could sure use the money from Apple Supplying the modems for the next iPhones could be bigger than Intels old deal of supplying smartphone processors to Asustek OTCASUUY Android smartphones and tablets I still expect Apple to sell more than million iPhonesyear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>possibly supplying LTE modems inside million iPhones can lead to a tidy billion per modem multiplied by million phones check from Tim Cook A billionyear check from iPhone modems can sooth the protracted pain caused by the ninefigure losses that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>incurred on phonetablet processors Getting the iPhone modem business is already enough incentive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to cancel its LTE SoFIA smartphone processors Going forward I expect Apple to also use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modems inside iPhones intended for countries where GSM is popular Most of the worlds networks are now compatible with GSM Qualcomm investors may want to take note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought the CDMA modem assets of Via Technologies last October Terms were not disclosed but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now owns Vias CDMA modem technology The timing of the Via Telecom CDMA modem deal also coincided with the October announcement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had employees working on the LTE modem for the iPhone I speculate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>only bought the CDMA assets after Apple already showed interest in Intels GSM LTE modem I do not know if Vias CDMA modems are as good as Qualcomms I only look forward to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>eventually convincing Tim Cook that its upcoming CDMA G or G modems are also good for the iPhone I suspect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is already working hard to come up with a CDMA modem to complement its GSM XSM LTE modems All those employees work is done after the iPhone s release Their next task will likely include improving the Via CDMA modem Supplying the modems for GSM and CDMA iPhones is the ultimate objective of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Unless Qualcomm offers better pricing Apple could eventually give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>an exclusive modem supply contract Getting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to supply GSM and CDMA LTE modems means Apple wont have to bother with building its own modems Yes there were rumors last year that Apple was allegedly trying to build its own modem Its now very logical to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could become Apples goto supplier for its future modem needs If Apple still has any intention left about building its own modem it would have bought the Icera assets that Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has been trying to dump since last year We should bet on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now before Apple makes official announcement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is really supplying modems for the new iPhone I am pretty confident that Wall Street traders will pump INTCs price after Apple makes an official confirmation Like I said earlier the annual modem needs of the iPhone could give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>around billionyear in new revenue Apples high margins on iPhones also means it did not have to force <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to give too big a discount on XMM LTE modems Yes I think the GSM iPhones will use the nm XMM modem This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE modem is good enough to match the specs of Qualcomms Gobi G modems Disclosure I amwe are long INTC AAPL NVDA QCOM I
