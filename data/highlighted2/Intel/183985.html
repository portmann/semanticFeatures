Reasons Why General Electric Has Much Bigger IoT Potential Than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Does General Electric Company NYSEGE Seeking Alpha GE is a hightech company disguised as a manufacturer The company has much more potential for IoT sales because of its diverse experience and customers Usually when you think of any comparison between General Electric NYSE GE and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC you might think of GE as home to dirty grubby lowtech factories while Intels factories are neat and bright and in fact have clean rooms Also the general impression would be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is extremely high tech while GE is more old school brick mortar and grease with little technology actually created at GE Many people remember only that GE had to clean up PCBs from the bottom of the Hudson River Nothing could be further from the truth Of course GEs founding goes back to the original Elon Musk Steve Jobs Bill Gates etc pick one Thomas Edison Edison is generally accepted as the greatest American inventor with over patents to his name The original GE was the Edison General Electric Company founded in So GE has been a hightech company for over years Over that time period GE has expanded its technological efforts to aircraft engines industrial pumps wind turbines locomotives industrial software and much much more The list is massive and you can see it here In fact in the s and s GE manufactured computers and developed its own mainframe operating system called GECOS It had some strange things though like a bit byte <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand has been almost exclusively a computer chip manufacturer founded in It has concentrated its efforts on making sure Moores Law converted into saleable products and it has done that in a masterly fashion The companys technological superiority in manufacturing chips is well known But Intels focus is very narrow while GEs is massively wide And that is why GEs IoT sales potential is much greater than Intels In this article I will give some of the reasons why GE will be much more successful in the IoT marketplace than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>GE sells end products while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sells parts to others who make end products Most of the things GE sells and there are literally thousands of things are products that the company by and large sells directly In Intels case it mostly sells parts that go into end products that other people then sell as complete units The most obvious are CPUs that it sells in the hundreds of millions to just a few customers In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>never sees the ultimate user of its products so the potential for it to sell IoT to them is limited GE on the other hand has direct contact and a relationship with entities that will be looking for IoT services General Electric already has hundreds s of thousands of direct customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>just a few I am unable to find a number on how many actual customers GE has but it is certainly in the s and maybe millions The number of significant customers for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand is probably in the dozens As you can see in the following chart in INTC sold more than million chips assuming IDCs market share to just desktop manufacturers Add in a few more customers in the Others group and maybe you are up to Then there are rd parties and component distributors such as Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Facebook NASDAQ FB CDW NASDAQ CDW Newegg Best Buy NYSE BBY etc Looking at this technically sophisticated group of customers I find it difficult to believe any of them would consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a toptier IoT provider of software analytics or services And as everyone knows that is where the profits will be made in IoT not in the manufacturing of chips If you look at the GE products page you will see major groups and over subgroups in sectors as diverse as Healthcare Aviation Oil Gas Power Water Mining Consumer goods and Software among others As GE develops its own IoT framework it should be able to easily apply the results to other manufacturers in similar businesses who probably are already GE customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand is in a very specialized manufacturing niche basically applicable only to other integrated circuits type companies As I mentioned above GE has been in the software business since at least the s when it developed the GECOS operating system Currently its software group contains the following At the intersection of people machines big data and analytics stands Predix the cloudbased platform for creating innovative Industrial Internet applications that turn realtime operational data into insight for better and faster decisionmaking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand has tried its hand at software with at best limited success McAfee a B acquisition in has done little to enhance Intels reputation for software excellence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is distancing itself from the name of its top security product McAfee after years of having its name dragged through the mud thanks to the misadventures of its founder John McAfee Source moneycnncom Since the key to success in the IoT marketplace will be software analytics and service GE is in an almost unique position to maximize its IoT sales efforts This is an advantage GE will have over many IoT vendors especially in the industrial sector Imagine selling a HP GE pump by telling your customer it will be connected to your Internet seconds after installation Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will never have an advantage like this I have previously written about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and IoT here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Internet Of Things Will Not Provide Significant Sales For The Foreseeable Future where I basically said Intels IoT future is limited because the competition has better products I think this article points out the disadvantages <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has in the IoT marketplace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will certainly get more server sales due to the massive amount of data that IoT will collect and analyze but it would get those sales whether or not it had an IoT division GE on the other hand has a huge potential for IoT sales In this excellent video from CNBC the number billion is thrown out as the IoT industrial marketplaces size I think GE has the potential to get a big chunk of that and would not be surprised if it creates a new IoT group in the next few years At this point I do not rate either company as a buy GE has problems in the Oil Gas industry as well as other industrial sectors as seen by Caterpillars NYSE CAT recent layoffs I go into more detail why GE is not a buy yet in this article GE At Times My Earnings Estimate Its Time To Sell And Move On For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>if the next market downdraft gets INTC below and a dividend I might be interested Otherwise I will wait until D NAND D XPoint or Skylake generate
