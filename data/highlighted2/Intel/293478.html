positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in INTC over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article A Microsoft Hardware Dev Center document shows that Microsoft is working on a Windows Desktop ARM version but that line has been deleted bad copy and paste A lot of excitement has grown up about it but it is very likely to run through x emulation which is power expensive and most likely inefficient Microsoft may be testing it but it does not mean that they will release it Previous Windows RT was simply a mistake The same source confirms that Microsoft is working on a Windows Mobile x version which has the potential to run x standard programs in Continuum On January an MSDN document came up on the web showing that Microsoft Corporation MSFT is working on an ARM Desktop version of Windows This news made people think that Microsoft is going again through the old Windows RT route for the joy of some ARM ARMH fans But this route is still very hard to undertake since the same old previous issues are still present nowadays And its more peculiar that in the same document theres a technical confirmation that Microsoft is working on a Windows Mobile x version which simply makes the Surface Phone route more solid and interesting Windows RT was an ARM desktop version released in and even if it received some good reviews about its touch light interface and multitasking capability its incompatibility with traditional x applications has been its death The fact that it was not possible to run the enormous series of x programs and the fact that the ARM applications available on the Windows Store were not sufficient at all they have led to its disappearance The story could be similar on a Windows Desktop ARM version Its true that Microsoft is working on a series of bridges Project Centennial Project Islandwood Project Westminster Project Astoria in order to increase the number and quality of the universal apps This could be quite helpful even if it is a relatively slow process Project Islandwood from iOS apps to Universal Apps will be released in the following months starting to generate some results Project Astoria from Android apps to Universal Apps has been put on hold while Project Westminster from Web to Universal Apps and Project Centennial from Win and NET to Universal Apps are still in a preview stage It is clear that Microsoft is working hard on this but the developing time looks to be excessively long and it will hardly provide any benefit in the following months There also is the thought that Microsoft is working on the emulation of x applications on the ARM architecture and this would be the fastest route talking about coding Personally they could even be working on it but it is the most far and remote target to attain emulating a x application and environment on an ARM architecture is extremely power inefficient and power hungry it is slow and it needs a lot of computational power In a world very keen to mobility and power efficiency this is not at all the right route to undertake Definitely In addition there are no desktop or laptop ARM SoCs designed nowadays and the ARM server SoCs are lacking They are still less powerful than the x counterpart talking about native code not to mention emulation Anyway another clue that Microsoft may be working on a Windows desktop with ARM is a job advertisement which comprises a position about ARM along the entire ecosystem devices Its not explicit for desktop ARM but it may be related In reality if you have taken a look at the first link you must have seen that there is no sign of a Windows Desktop ARM version anymore Microsoft has deleted that line maybe because the development is still quite behind or maybe because it was simply a mistake and they know that it is not a viable route nowadays The oddity is that this document confirms that Microsoft is definitely working on a mobile version on x architecture That is the real deal a lot of rumor and declarations already suggested it but a written confirmation was what was lacking The ability to use native x code makes it easier to adapt older x traditional applications Continuum could really be modified to run traditional applications with x hardware This would be a very interesting route certainly more feasible than emulating the x architecture A pocket PC would be perfect for productivity and it would be ready to use at it fullest in continuum mode it is something that could change the smartphone panorama But what are the real issues here First of all the development timing for the Continuum adoption it is possible that Microsoft could be ready this year or it may take additional time getting in However the real issue comes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation INTC the Santa Clara company has to provide something powerful but with low TDP We talk about something performing like the Core M SoCs but with a TDP similar to the actual x and x SoCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to release its new Morganfield platform this year with the new Goldmont cores The focus of the issue is there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to improve its mobile solutions until the point that power consumption and performance meet each other The Surface Phone must meet the needs of the Continuum user in front of the monitor through speedy multitasking and officemultimedia contents while meeting the battery life smoothness flexibility and apps qualitynumber as a Windows smartphone In addition highend smartphone SoCs are generally powered by powerful GPUs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has grown up fast with its latest GPUs but the graphic cards powering the actual Atom solutions are still not enough If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants a decent launch of its new Morganfield platform it definitely needs something particularly performing even at low TDP In any case the future success and arrival of a Windows Mobile x version is all in Intels power it will largely depend on performance Goldmont architecture will be the first one built from or better from BroadwellSkylake while the Silvermont and Airmont cores were mere tweaks of older architectures That is why my expectations are quite high At the same time Microsoft must do its work to make Windows Mobile and Continuum efficient enough to be smooth with low TDP x SoCs If we take a look at the Surface with xx Atom solutions which are quite good the route looks promising A smartphonePocket PC market where traditional apps are able to run even on such small devices once connected to an external screen its a potential market that Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must meet and exploit the chance for high revenue is consistent and it would halt the ARM run in Intels favor Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>start nearly from zero market share in the mobile segment Therefore this route could be the right choice to earn consistent market share Tagged Investing
