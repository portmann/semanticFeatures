sector Like the drop in oil prices that caused the panic among energy companies the huge decline in the personal computer market has taken a drastic toll on chip companies whose business relies on high PC sales And that makes chip giant Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA a tough trade given that more than its revenue comes from its Graphics Processing Unit a PCdependent segment To its credit Nvidia understands what it is up against The Santa Clara CAbased company has begun to expand its products into nontraditional industries like automobiles targeting corporate enterprises for its virtualization GRID a technology that provides interactive graphics But this is not yet a huge segment for the company Nvidia is several more quarters away before making a lucrative enterprise And following the companys mixed firstquarter earnings and downbeat outlook Thursday it doesnt appear Nvidia stock despite its relatively cheap price has much upside For now investors would be better served moving on to stocks with better nearterm prospect For the quarter that ended April Nvidia posted net income of million or cents per share On an adjusted basis when excluding onetime gains and costs earnings came to cents per share topping analyst estimates of cents The company benefited from solid gross margins topping its midpoint range of of revenue advancing some basis points year over year But that was the extent of the good news Sure revenue climbed year over year reaching billion But it also missed Wall Street estimates by about million And even if we grant that the strong US dollar impacted revenue this still doesnt address the struggles Nvidia has had to overcome in the past twelve months Whats more important to focus on is the extent to which Nvidia can lessen its dependency on personal computer sales which declined globally in the first quarter to million units And things arent going to improve anytime soon according to research firm IDC which predicts another decline for all of In that vein Nvidia is not taking any chances lowering its business outlook for the second quarter ending in June Why When PC sales on the decline it means weak demand for its graphic processors Unlike rivals Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Nvidia doesnt haven a strong offsetting segment like smartphones which Qualcomm is the leader of or the InternetofThings an area <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is looking to dominate To that end it doesnt make sense to place a bet on Nvidia at this level not when its second quarter
