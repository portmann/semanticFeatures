attractive The main business of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is microprocessors for personal computers However the global PC market is shrinking and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been late to the fast growing market of tablets and smartphones In this article I try to determine if Intels growing segments Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group can compensate for the decline in its PC business and provide a continuous growth to the company Beginning with the publication of Intels first quarter earnings report the company revised the presentation of its operating segments to reflect the combination of the PC Client Group and the Mobile and Communications Group to create the Client Computing Group For the following comparison I have recalculated the previous quarters results according to the revised presentation To determine if Intels growing segments Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group can compensate for the decline in its PC business and provide a continuous growth to the company I compared the results of the latest quarter to the same quarter two years ago The total increase in revenue of the Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group in these two years was at million slightly higher than the Client Computing Group revenue decrease of million However total increase in operating income of the Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group in these two years was at million a million higher than the Client Computing Group operating income decrease of million Hence in the last two years Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group have just compensated the Client Computing Group revenue decrease and have given a small total operating income growth of Although the two growing segments Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group have barely compensated the PC business decline these segments could in the future contribute to healthy growth for the entire company The reason for this is very obvious and could be described by one word Compound Since the Compound annual growth rate or CAGR of the revenues and operating income of the two growing segments is much higher than the rate of decline of the Client Computing Group they can in few years compensate for the decline in the PC business The tables below show the revenue and operating income of the three segments after five years assuming that the growth rates of the three segments would not change This indicates a total annual growth of in revenue and a total annual growth of in operating income Of course this calculation is theoretical and no one guarantees the same rate of growth for the segments for the next five years However the trend is valid PC sales may recover due to Windows launch in the summer but there is no doubt that users would use more tablets in the future In addition the high demand for data center solutions and the migration to cloud networking is not going to stop Moreover according to some companies the impact of the Internet of Everything will be to times greater than that of the Internet today Every country every city every business every home and every car is becoming digital Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has changed the presentation of its operating segments we do not have the mobile business exact results for the latest quarter Mobile and Communications Group have caused the company an enormous loss in the previous quarters Operating loss of the group in the fourth quarter of was at million and million in the third quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been late to the fast growing market of tablets and smartphones However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has an ambitious program to gain market share in the strong growing mobile market and for this reason it accepts losses in order to increase market share Considering Intels financial and technological extensive resources I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be able to fulfill its goal in this fast growing market Intels valuation metrics are very good the forward PE is low at and its Enterprise ValueEBITDA ratio is very low at In addition INTCs Margins and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median its sector median and the SP median as shown in the tables below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been paying uninterrupted dividends since The forward annual dividend yield is at and the payout ratio only The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was at over the past five years was at and over the past ten years was very high at In the last quarter the company generated approximately billion in cash from operations paid dividends of billion and used million to repurchase million shares of stock In the last two years the fastgrowing Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group have just compensated the Client Computing Group revenue decrease and have given a small total operating income growth However due to much higher growth rate these segments could in the future contribute to healthy growth for the entire company I also believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will gain market share in the tablets and smartphones market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has compelling valuation metrics its enterprise valuetoEBITDA ratio is very low at In addition the company is generating strong free cash flows and returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments All these factors bring me to the conclusion that INTCs stock is a smart longterm investment Source Is
