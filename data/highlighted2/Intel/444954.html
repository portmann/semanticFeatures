DCG IoT and Memory will offset declines in PC and drive growth Intels top management is a key driver in Intels success with strong activity in acquisitions Technology companies have garnered my attention and interest due to the technological advancement the world will experience within the near future This led me into the semiconductors the industry that provides the components of building the future Competition is fierce with success resting on the companys ability to produce products that provides superior advantage to its competitors It is difficult to determine who will succeed within the industry but I have determined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is the horse I will place my bet on With advances in virtual reality augmented reality selfdriving cars drones and big data this will change the way all businesses governments and consumers interact with the world This is what I believe will drive growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Industry trends are positioned favourably for Intels key growth segments but their strategy for success is what convinces me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will lead the future Historic declines of Global PC Shipments are the underlying factor why the market is mispricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>From its peak of M shipments in declining to M in Statistica this has resulted in revenue decreasing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Client Computing Group segment M in to M in Despite decreases in CCG revenue total revenue has increased from B to B respectively Emphasis is placed on CCG representing of total revenue in being reduced to in This displays Intels ability to drive growth from other areas other than its PC group Intels stock price has increased by from to which poses the question is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>really being mispriced IYW tracks the Dow Jones US Technology Index and SMH tracks the US Semiconductor Index With SMH up and IYW up Intels stock price falls in line with its comparisons The market may recognize the importance that semiconductors play in the world but does the decline of PCs instill fear in investors thus creating an opportunity I believe the market is overly bearish on PCs and fails to recognize the growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is positioned for with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>down since There are three growth segments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is positioned to experience growth in Data Centers InternetofThings and Memory Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has displayed innovation that no other competitor is able to rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made many acquisitions that fuel growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to succeed in IoT including pattern recognition machine learning advanced driver assistance systems robotics autonomous machines and D technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has proven to extract value from acquisitions with display of integrating Ascending Technologies into their RealSense camera enables drones to sense what is happening around it avoid collisions and detect a persons blood pressure and heat The IoT industry is projected to grow to T in IDC and managements demonstration of leading in IoT is why I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will capture this growth Intels D XPoint Technology is the biggest single advancement in memory in over years This will be a key growth segment as it is x faster at copying data than a NANDbased SSD and will be able to store TB into a mm thick drive This breakthrough in technology will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>maintain a competitive advantage amongst competitors as it will benefit all of Intels segments from increasing memory processing time and reducing costs in laptops desktops and servers Lastly Intels Data Center Group is Intels key pillar that will drive profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>boasts a operating margin in its DCG segment in comparison to its PC groups DCG will experience enormous growth as consumers shift from traditional servers to the cloud As more devices become smart and connected huge amounts of data is being generated creating the need to capture and analyze the data Cloud IT Infrastructure is projected to grow to B in IDC further strengthening my bullish outlook for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Intels current price of indicates a significant discount to the target price of implying a return which includes a dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a history of consecutively raising its quarterly dividends over the past years from in to in A target price of was achieved through a blended DCF analysis using the Gordon Growth Method and Multiples Method <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is valued at a deep discount compared with its competitors based on trading multiples such as PE and EVEBITDA With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>being judged mainly on the decline of the PC industry and reduction in efforts towards the smartphone and tablet market Intels share price has declined since This presents an opportunity to capture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at a discount Evidence of Intels ability to diversify away from the PC business into much more profitable segments such as its Data Center Group is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does not deserve its harsh decline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is positioned extremely well with a lead in three key growth segments Data Centers InternetofThings and Memory Continued domination in the PC market along with strong growth in DCG IoT and Memory is why I do not fear the decline of the PC industry I believe this fear creates an opportunity to exploit the markets mispricing around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and establish a position of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>into your portfolios With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>leading in market share and product innovation this supports my bullish perspective on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is significantly undervalued compared with competitors and being the leader in semiconductors I am confident in Intels ability to capture the industrys growth and stand as a company that leads the future Long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation Inc
