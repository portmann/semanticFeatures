With MediaTek unveiling LTEintegrated SoCs fit for phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to scrap SoFIA and Broxton processors It is a tactical retreat to protect more

The iPhone GLTE modem deal with is in the bag <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants to focus on modems to keep Apple happy Intels NASDAQ INTC reported decision to cancel further development of SoFIABroxton SoCs is misunderstood by other writers They think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already surrendered on smartphone processors In my view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>simply made a strategic retreat to fight another day The figure operating losses from subsidizing Atom chips has drained but not defeated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The cancellation is likely due to MediaTeks upcoming entrylevel LTEequipped SoCs I suspect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Rockchip are nearly done with the final design of the SoFIA Atom xC LTE SoC However it got shelved to save money The MT SoC will get inside Android phones by summer Unlike before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cannot afford to subsidize SoFIA processors against this kind of cutthroat pricing from MediaTek The everdeclining sales of traditional PCs and emerging threats to its x server business are forcing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to rein in costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to conserve resources to build a moat around its server sales Making the best data center chips is the only way it could protect its lead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cannot stop Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD from licensing x SoC design to other firms Aside from THATIC AMD also could create joint ventures with other firms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>therefore needs more manpower and resources to develop bestinclass Xeons and microserver Atom processors Keeping its big lead over AMD Opteron chips is the only way to neutralize the THATIC joint venture threat Discontinuing the SoFIA processors is a nobrainer Some key features of the Atom xC made it inferior to MediaTeks latest entrylevel LTEready SoC The cheapest nm MediaTek MT SoC comes with a Cat LTE modem and MaliT MP GPU The topend SoFIA Atom xC only comes with a MaliT MP GPU disparity is important because gaming performance is a big selling point even on entrylevel phones Consequently even with equal price tags OEMs will still choose the ARMbased MT over the Atom xC Avoiding a bloody price war now over phone SoCs is a laudable move Instead of wasting eightfigures on contra revenue for SoFIABroxton SoCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could use the money to improve its standalone modem products Becoming a longterm cosupplier of iPhone modems will require <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to constantly come up with better designs Keeping Apple happy will let <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earn million annual sales supplying modems for the iPhone This is enough to augment this years revenue from supplying million x processors to Asusteks phones Yes even with Intels cancellation of SoFIABroxton Asustek will still use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoCs on of its target million phones for The cancellation of SoFIABroxton chips could be compensated by sales of Intelpowered PC sticks Chromebooks and miniPCs AMD still has little interest in ultrasmallpocket WindowsLinux computer products The upcoming release of Apollo Lake processors will also let <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>further dominate the lowend PC market The W SDP rating of Apollo Lake makes it ideal for standalone tablets and in tabletlaptop products Sales of detachable laptops continue to rise and majority of these products use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors I do not expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to ever abandon smartphone processors The phone form factor is the next evolution of computers Laptop shell products will run under the power of smartphones The Nexdock and Superbook are good examples why productivityfocused smartphones will replace the traditional laptop Windows Android and Linux can run on smartphones Nextgeneration phones can work with laptop shells and standalone monitors Intels x processor IP is the only chip versatile enough to run any operating system Without a strong presence on smartphone processors ARMbased Android handsets that run Remix OS could become the next standard for productivityfocused phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>therefore still needs to create an integrated phone SoC to protect its core desktop PC business Failing to do so means ARMbased Android phones that operate like keyboardandmouse computers will make x even less attractive to OEMs Looking forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Rockchip could covertly work on integrating a G modem inside a nm or nm x phone SoC The future of Intels x chip business depends a lot on how soon it could create processors with integrated modems It might take or years but it is a very important venture It will be useless of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to have the best discreet G modem when a majority of phone manufacturers want integrated ModemGPUCPU SoCs Even Apple should it get to buy its own modem IP will try to incorporate modems inside its custom Aseries processors Cost concerns spacesavings and energy efficiency favor the allinone integrated phone SoC The temporary respite from smartphone chip development is not a reason to go bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>On the contrary it should inspire us to buy more INTC shares <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is simply putting its money where it can make money SoFIABroxton were bad bets that needed to be folded By doing so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gets to use more money in defending its plus share in x server chips I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
