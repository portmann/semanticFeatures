Logical Reason Why Apple Will Use An <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Modem Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Rumors indicate that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>XMM will go in a future iPhone model After weighing the potential upside for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Apple the rumors actually have legs Qualcomm will be more dependent on emerging OEMs as a result while Intels mobile business is likely to avert losses as a result of Apple Furthermore Apples iPhone gross margin will likely improve as a result of using the XMM This puts Qualcomm in a tenuous situation as its modem is its highest ASP product and losing this business will reduce licensing revenue by millionplus devices per fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC might win a bit of Apple NASDAQ AAPL business based on a report from Apple Insider Now when weighing rumors I often think about the driving motivations that could cause a company to shift their strategy so drastically Well in the case of Apple it designs the vast majority of its own IP blocks and quite frankly Apple licenses from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM when it comes to the modem and RF transceiver and various other IP pertaining to connectivity When looking at an iHS teardown of component costs the modem and RF transceiver is more expensive than every other component aside from the display Hence its no surprise Apple wants to use Intels modem as an alternative as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to build some momentum behind its modem business and is likely to license out its IP at a lower rate than Qualcomm We witnessed Intels contrarevenue program last year and they do price aggressively Im pretty certain theyll price anywhere along a demand curve to stimulate demand If we look very carefully at AnandTechs diagram <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will have a CAT modem available roughly when Qualcomm has a CAT modem Qualcomm usually operates six months to a year ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>when it comes to release cadence However theres no real marginal value to the CAT modem that Qualcomm is set to release because none of the carriers offer speeds up to MBps As you can tell the download rate maxes out at around MBPS well below the speed of Category which indicates that carriers will need to figure out a way to boost bandwidth by investing more heavily into cell towers while looking for configuration that can further develop carrier aggregation technologies To gain a better understanding of carrier aggregation and the various standards they operate by please refer to this report So even if Apple were to go with an inferior modem in Intels XMM its likely that Apple iPhone owners wont notice any considerable difference in performance Unless if youre operating on Googles Fiber network or live in a country where GBps is common advancements in modem technology wont have any considerable impact on the quality of data speed Hence Apple can cut costs a little by using an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem over a Qualcomm modem as consumers will not feel the marginal difference in quality Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is one of Apples primary vendors Unlike Qualcomm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides the CPUs for Apples MacBook and iMac lineup So it shouldnt surprise anyone that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some negotiating leverage when compared to Qualcomm which is why I think Qualcomm will lose a lot of Apples business going forward Furthermore Apples iPhone margins are likely to improve as a result of using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>over Qualcomm When looking at the earlier iHS figure the wireless section represents around of Apples COGS If Apple can reduce this cost by a full five percentage points gross margins could improve by a percent or so driving significant bottom line growth for Apple in future fiscal years Therefore investors have to consider these four outcomes Apple iPhone margins have further room to expand in FY Intels mobile business will reduce losses considerably on future iPhone volume Qualcomms IPlicensing business will become more dependent on devices in the Android ecosystem making future financial results dependent on Samsung LG and Chinese OEMs Qualcomms business could have difficulty with reporting top line growth as modems have the highest ASPs and margins After taking into consideration the upsidedownside I think both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Apple present a much better risk to reward than Qualcomm at the present moment Despite these comparisons Qualcomms mobile business is still dominant in the low to midend as the company can cross license all the relevant IP for many emerging OEMs Despite emerging OEMs Apple is projected to ship millionplus devices per year for the next couple years so the loss of Apple to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will hit Qualcomms top line and bottom line considerably On the back of these developments Im lowering my optimism on Qualcomm from a buy to a hold and continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Apple Source A Logical Reason Why Apple Will Use An <span style='background-color:
