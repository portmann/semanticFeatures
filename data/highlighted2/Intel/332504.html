be driving the new iPad to be a smaller version of the iPad Pro One of the more disappointing aspects of Apples NASDAQ AAPL December quarter earnings report was the nearly yy decline in iPad unit shipments Apple has clearly needed to do more than introduce the iPad Pro Apples nextgen iPad Air will be part this effort Only it wont be called iPad Air if rumors are correct Instead it will be identified as an iPad Pro model but with a inch screen Whatever the device is to be called it will be considerably beefed up from the iPad Air Rumor has it that it will receive the Ax SOC from the iPad Pro and feature support for a detachable keyboard and Apple Pencil as well As of my recent article on the iPad Pro I had been expecting features such as Apple Pencil support to make their way into the rest of the iPad lineup The rumor indicates that Apple is moving out fairly aggressively to enhance the utility of iPad There have been rumors for some time of a March event and its now thought that the new iPad will make its debut then Why the lag time between the largesized iPad Pro and this new midsized version I really think it was just due to Ax availability The Ax is thought to be fabricated exclusively by TSMC NYSE TSM TSMC was still ramping their nm FinFET process as of the end of the year and there just werent enough of the Ax processors to go around From the rumors it appears that the mid Pro will share a very similar design to the large Pro with quad stereo speakers and smart keyboard interface along one edge Presumably there will be a smaller smart keyboard to go with the mid Pro but I cant imagine why anyone would want it A smaller more cramped version of the flimsy plastic Smart Dumb Keyboard is the last thing the world needs Apple Pencil support on the other hand looks to be an easy sell Its more compact and lighter than a keyboard and well suited to text input as well as drawing The mid Pro is in some ways better suited as a note taking tool than large Pro I fully expect Pencil support to spread to all three sizes of iPad which suggests that a mini Pro is also on the cards In my last article on the iPad Pro I spent a lot of time examining the issue of iPad Pro as a productivity tool compared with the Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro or any of the other Windows tablets or convertibles that feature <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC processors Not to belabor the point but the productivity gap between iPad Pro and Surface Pro and similar devices is still there and isnt going away I can understand Apple not wanting to paste touchscreen capability onto Mac OS X Apple seems to want to focus on iOS as its platform of the future Its more advanced secure and certainly more lucrative than Mac OS X But if Apple really wants to broaden the appeal of iPad and keep it competitive with the host of Win devices running <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors it had better do more than its doing now Yes Apple is going to keep advancing its processor technology which is already very impressive Processing power isnt really the limiting factor Most likely the next A generation will move out in front of Intels Skylake But maybe Kabylake will stay ahead By A Apple should have sufficient processing power to compete effectively with Wintel tablets and convertibles even those featuring Core M series processors Yes Apple is going to continue to endow iOS with new features and make it more useful on mobile devices But can iPad really compete in productivity staying within the strictures of the iOS touchscreen interface I really doubt it At some point Apple will need to relax its selfimposed edict against convergence It can do that either through iOS or Mac OS X but I think iOS makes more sense That probably means support for an onscreen cursor Using an iOS device with a monitor or TV screen is fairly painless through video adapters or Airplay but its hampered by the need to look back at the iOS device to make touch input Would support for an onscreen cursor which Android has had for years be such a terrible violation of the convergence prohibition For the time being apparently yes I maintain hope for the future however Theres nothing like having your revenue and market share chewed up in the maw of the Wintel juggernaut to change your mindset Its happened before My prediction about the spread of iPad Pro features to other members of the iPad lineup came true so fast because of competitive pressure That same pressure can be expected to eventually force a more flexible position on convergence Despite Apples protestations to the contrary every WWDC for the past few years has featured increased convergence between iOS and Mac OS X and I dont expect this year to be any different IDC in its yearend report on the tablet market had some interesting things to say about the iPad Pro IDC observed that while the pure slate tablet exemplified by the iPad was declining the detachable tablet tablets with a detachable keyboard was growing very strongly as the chart below shows Despite lukewarm reviews the iPad Pro was the clear winner this season as it was the topselling detachable surpassing notable entries from Microsoft and other PC vendors Its also important to note that the transition towards detachable tablets has presented positive opportunities for both Apple and Microsoft This clearly demonstrates that Apple has gone in the right direction with the Pro and explains why the iPad Pro lineup is expanding Market forces are driving this and will continue to do so Eventually Apple will relent on its convergence stance and provide iOS users with the fullfledged productivity platform they want When that happens the combined benefits of Apples processor and operating system expertise I expect to get iPad market share growing again I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article
