There were already several headwinds to PC demand growth most notably the fact that old PCs remain good enough Still theres yet another factor which again keeps older PCs good enough This factor is the SSD which has gotten cheap and large enough to make it a viable option to update aging PCs In the rather distant past I wrote on how SSDs Solid State Drives would ultimately be a problem for HDDs Hard Disk Drives This is rather obvious and getting nearer by the day On another theme I also wrote about how PCs were getting good enough so that they didnt need to be replaced nearly as often with negative implications for companies like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Today I am going to write about another such phenomenon which kind of marries the two above You see the expansion of the SSD market is also a problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft This is so because adding an SSD to an older desktop or laptop device greatly increases its speed and thus keeps that device good enough for much longer The speed increase is highly noticeable in boot time launching individual applications launching documents as long as theyre stored in the SSD and in overall usage especially for older devices working on low RAM and using virtual memory An old device going from HDD storage which they all had to SSD storage will easily remain usable for a few more years SSDs have due to their nature an intrinsic advantage in read and write speeds but more importantly still they have a massive advantage orders of magnitude in random read and write speeds Since Windows relies heavily in HDD access replacing the HDD increases speed nearly everywhere And it increases it so much that an old computer starts looking like a new one Furthermore SSDs have kept on getting cheaper and larger And now were crossing the threshold where they are cheap enough and large enough that their usage as an OS and apps partition is entirely feasible A Gb SSD can now be had for and years down the road D NAND stands to make it even larger and cheaper But at Gb this is already the kind of storage capacity which can give a new lease of life to a yearold computer Also SSDs are so small and consume so little power that they fit easily into laptops in place of their existing HDDs and can even improve battery life though laptops that old have either taken on a new battery or they wont have much in the way of battery life Clues That Microsoft Is Not Oblivious To This Its rather easy to upgrade most components in your PC except perhaps the motherboard since Windows might recognize it as a hardware change requiring a new Windows license Its also easy to install Windows in a new SSD from scratch But guess what theres a clue that Microsoft isnt that interested in you having your PC living a few more years After all Microsoft only sells new Windows licenses when you buy a new computer especially now that it has more or less given up on upgrade revenues with the launch of Windows Why do I say this Well because the one use case which is very useful for someone wanting to upgrade to an SSD is the only case where doing it is not as easy Basically any user wanting to upgrade his old computer will be most interested in migrating all its OS and apps into the new SSD in such a way that the apps remain installed and working when the process is done To do this the user needs to clone his existing drive into the new SSD drive And it turns out that doing this is quite a bit harder for the common user than doing most of the other upgrading or installing Moreover theres a great benefit for Windows users using SSDs in turning from their default and most common SATA IDE configuration to a configuration based on SATA AHCI Again everything else is easy except for this Even though its only a slight change in configuration getting AHCI to work involves changing one value in the registry and doing a safeboot to upgrade drivers etc etc It neednt be so its clearly something which could have been handled automatically But it isnt I see both of these longstanding issues the easiness in cloning and the AHCI configuration as a kind of recognition that going the SSD route greatly decreases the incentive to buy a new computer with its own Windows and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU Obviously there are tens of different companies providing free and paid apps which solve the difficulties I stated so they ultimately wont be an obstacle Anyway the trend towards doing this upgrade will only get stronger as the SSDs have gotten cheap and large enough that theyre an obvious cheap and valuable upgrade path instead of springing for a whole new PC Its thus likely that wordofmouth will make this a larger trend further impacting the new PC sales and thus demand for Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products from the retail side The data center demand ought not to be impacted since there are considerations regarding performance and power savings in new chip generations which this upgrade doesnt address Needless to say I did such an upgrade myself recently The results are fantastic and its clearly a choice which has great value to it I didnt actually need it as the specs on my desktop PC were more than enough to handle anything I threw at it and yet I can still feel speed differences everywhere The effects would have been much larger had I been upgrading a laptop with limited RAM and a slow HDD Other than the recent pop in demand for new PCs due to the end of the Windows XP support it remains likely that the PC market will continue to languish PCs are simply too powerful and mobile devices add another factor keeping people from updating them To this we can now add a further headwind presented by the fact that SSDs are a cheap and effective way to add years of life to an aging PC As a side note it really looks like that NANDflash memory demand is bound to see a sustained increase in usage over the next few years not just driven by the mobile sector anymore but also by this trend towards increased usage in PCs and ultimately in data centers Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI
