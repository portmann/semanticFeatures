I amwe are long INTC IBM MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article In a recent research report Forrester said that IoT security technologies are still in the creation phase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security has changed its strategy to combat the growing threat of RansomwareasaService and similar threats In the wake of the Internet on Things revolution the magnitude of online security threats is growing rapidly Device makers are more concerned about launching new products and less about security Market research firm Forrester believes the IoT ecosystem needs to solidify itself in order to maintain privacy and security In a recent research report it said Most hardware and networking IoT technologies have hit the Growth phase or even the Equilibrium phase IoT software is in the Survival phase But standards are nascent as vendors are only a couple of years into the process of creating generalpurpose interoperability standards And IoT security technologies are still in the Creation phase with no established products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC acquired McAfee a provider of security products and services in McAfee now is a part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security To combat the growing threats of ransomware along with RansomwareasaService business model McAfee is continuously strengthening its security product platform RansomwareasaService is aimed at offering inexperienced cybercriminals threat service such as sending ransomware In this article I will try to assess the commercial viability of Intels security push Cybercriminals raise money in the form of ransom by sending ransomware to enterprises They first steal confidential business information business strategies employee usernames and passwords etc and then promise to return that information against lofty ransom They could seek to exploit IoT and cloud services in order to increase the number of attacks Cybercriminals take the advantage of increasingly complex and fragmented IT infrastructure of enterprises To combat against latest form of security threats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security has changed its strategy by moving towards an entirely new direction When McAfee was independent it used to provide protection via offering customers traditional security products such as endpoint and network security web and email security security analytics etc However the company found that instead of providing protection building an endtoend solution around an attacks life cycle would be more beneficial for customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Securitys new strategy is narrowing focus on endpoints and cloud control points This new strategy aims at protecting the corporate networks which are accessed through remote devices It has launched two solutions for this new approach viz McAfee Endpoint Security X and McAfee Active Response However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security has sold off its Stonesoft firewall business to Raytheon Websense a Texasbased cybersecurity firm because the business wasnt compatible with the approach McAfee grew up as a security product company Many security professionals still think that McAfee is just another antivirus vendor However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security is trying to change this perception by transforming the company to a provider of SecurityasaService The SecurityasaService business model works by offering enterprises subscriptionbased security services This ensures a continuous flow of revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security and for clients its a costeffective way to fight cyberattacks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security is aiming at developing a robust security ecosystem around its new protect detect and correct strategy by integrating thirdparties with the evolving SecurityasaService platform The companys biggest competitor is Symantec NASDAQ SYMC But IBMs NYSE IBM IBM Security is fast emerging as one of the most soughtafter security service providers for enterprises I believe that going forward IBM Security will become <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Securitys biggest competitor replacing Symantec Since IBM has a loyal customer base building a SecurityasaService platform and integrating it with its existing software ecosystem will be easier for IBM IBM Securitys XForce threat intelligence team which is its RD department is developing a security platform that targets IBMs existing enterprise customers IBM offers managed security services to its existing customers as well as new customers Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not a software company building partnerships with thirdparty software companies is essential for developing a security ecosystem Recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security has expanded its partnership with VMwares NYSE VMW enterprise mobility subsidiary AirWatch for broadening the ecosystem to include mobility In when VMware and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security teamed up for integrating their respective technologies for making the softwaredefined networks more secure the ecosystem began to develop Now it remains to be seen whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can beat IBM with its new approach Intels advantage is that its security offering starts from chiplevel Intels TXT trusted execution technology is a hardware technology which uses cryptographic techniques for combating softwarebased attacks TXT prevents enterprises from cyberattacks which are designed to work by corrupting system andor BIOS code IBMs SoftLayer was the first cloud vendor that adopted Intels TXT for offering customers TXTsupported bare metal virtual servers This indicates that Intels security push has huge revenue growth potential in the long run SecurityasaService is a fairly new concept As it continues to evolve the demand for security services will rise The creators of ransomware such as CryptoWall CryptoLock ZeroLocker etc operate by encrypting hard disk contents and then demanding ransom To prevent such threats chiplevel security is an absolute necessity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the only company in the world which has the potential to offer such security Tagged Investing Ideas Technology
