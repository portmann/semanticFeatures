including the next iPhone Apple will probably commit to full production by TSMC of its next generation A series processors by years end Apples NASDAQ AAPL growing iPhone empire presents potential opportunities for investments in supplier companies Investors should be cautious however as winning a place on the next iDevice is not a guarantee of huge profits Among Apples many suppliers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE TSM may be positioned to profit the most from the next iPhone and beyond As we approach the launch of the next iPhone probably on September were seeing the usual process of rumors converging to a fairly close approximation of the truth Leaks become more common as suppliers start production Once production starts many more people are privy to details of the next iPhone Pictures of component parts and other production and design details begin to proliferate Most of the details have been known for weeks The S will feature an external design almost identical to the current iPhone but will be strengthened to minimize bending The display will be unchanged The biggest physical changes are expected to be the addition of Force Touch and a new Apple system on chip SOC dubbed the A Opinions differ regarding the market advantage offered by Force Touch Apples Taptic Engine is a device similar to the vibrators found in smartphones except that it can deliver a distinct impulse through the screen that feels something like a button click Combined with precise applied force measurement Force Touch provides an element of tactile feedback that will be exclusive to iPhone I believe that Force Touch will provide a positive discriminator but perhaps is still lacking the killer app to make it essential This may come in time as developers find novel ways to incorporate Force Touch into their apps The A SOC is expected to be the first Apple SOC fabricated on an nm scale FinFET process Apple will only be the second smartphone company to feature this technology after Samsung OTCSSNLF The benefits of nm are faster processors with lower power consumption Some leaked results seem to confirm the expected performance improvement for the A What hasnt been clear is how production would be split for the new A Based on TSMCs Q guidance regarding their nm FinFET production ramp it didnt appear that TSMC would be able to support production of the initial batch of new iPhones that will go on sale in September As of the Q earnings report in midJuly TSMC has started the production ramp on nm but this is not in time to support the September iPhone launch TSMC would have needed to be already in full production for that Therefore Samsung will get exclusive presence on the next iPhone when it debuts iPhone teardowns start almost as soon as the new iPhone is released so I expect those teardowns to show a Samsung fabricated A Samsungs win of the A production may be short lived however Apple is clearly motivated to reduce its dependence on Samsung The ongoing IP disputes with Samsung as well as Samsungs early use of its nm process to gain advantage for the Galaxy S mandate that Apple sever its ties with Samsung once and for all How quickly Apple can transition to exclusive TSMC supply is unknown but TSMCs guidance for Q provides an important clue TSMC guided essentially flat on a year over year basis for Q revenue Thats actually remarkable given a number of factors Last year TSMC had exclusive production of the previous generation A and probably the AX as well If TSMC had lost that business to Samsung for H I would expect them to be hurting a lot more in Q Especially because of declining sales for Qualcomm and the concentration of upper tier smartphone sales in Samsung and Apple TSMCs guidance indicates that they anticipate winning a lot of the A business This will probably be paced only by TSMCs ability to ramp production By next year I expect Apple to be fully committed to TSMC for mobile SOC production assuming TSMCs production ramp supports Apples needs TSMC was very bullish for FinFET production at the Q earnings conference so I expect that TSMC will be able to ramp production sufficiently to meet the needs of Apple and other likely customers such as AMD By not competing with Apple TSMC has cemented its position as a trusted supplier going forward This makes TSMC one of the most attractive of Apple suppliers as an investment TSMC is highly profitable having a gross margin of and operating margin of in Q Yy growth in revenue was and EPS was in Q In Q total revenue was billion and operating income was billion Unlike so many commodity semiconductor makers these days TSMC is not struggling to make a profit One of the most interesting questions asked by any analyst at the TSMC Q earnings conference was asked by Dan Heyler of Bank of America Merill Lynch He asked as you look at processors coming out today core core processors moving to nanometer Cortex looks pretty much like a PClevel processor Im wondering what kind of computational opportunities are there for you to grow next year or as you look into the broader markets with performance levels being as high as they are were now moving kind of out the smartphone era much more into a compute capability is that a growth opportunity This echoes a long standing theme of mine that the trend of increasing capability of ARM processors would eventually make them suitable for applications beyond mobile including general PC use and servers Were already seeing some movement into the server space but use in general purpose PCs has been limited to a few low end Chromebooks This of course brings the ARM ecosystem into direct conflict with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>supporters tend to dismiss But the fact that ARM foundries such as TSMC and Samsung are starting to close the process gap with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>combined with the increasing capability of ARM processor designs makes this conflict all but inevitable My first question is on the computing opportunities I think now TSMC seems to be narrowing the gap in the process technology and when should we see that the TSMC is ready to enter the notebook market And also what is preventing TSMC to ARM server or even TSMC to enter the notebook market in large volume Is that software or more of hardware While TSMC management kind of ducked Heylers question Lu managed to get a more direct answer from Morris Chang TSMCs Chairman I think we are obviously very actively pursuing that market Now of course we need a very capable partner as well as ARM ARM we already have ARM is a valuable has been a valuable partner for us for many years now But in addition to ARM we also will need a capable design company And then the partners together the three main ones TSMC ARM the design company and many others that we have always had the equipment people etc we think that we have a chance of becoming an important factor in that market Hmm Who could that very capable design partner be Apple certainly
