</span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha May ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corpo INTC By Eric Jhonsa SA Eye on Tech SA News Editor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is buying Itseez a Russian developer of computer vision algorithms and related technology for embedded systems Terms are undisclosed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>This acquisition furthers Intels efforts to win in IoT market segments like automotive and video where the ability to electronically perceive and understand images paves the way for innovation and opportunity Itseez will become a key ingredient for Intels Internet of Things Group IOTG roadmap and will help Intels customers create innovative deeplearningbased CV applications like autonomous driving digital security and surveillance and industrial inspection The acquisition comes less than two months after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought Yogitech an Italian provider of functional safety solutions for chips they help prevent chips within cars industrial equipment and other embedded systems from failing and alert users in the event that they do Last year video processor developer Ambarella bought VisLab an Italian developer of computer vision and intelligent control systems for cars and other products Mobileye is currently the top provider of vision processors for the advanced driverassistance system ADAS market NXP and Nvidia are also eying the market Earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>abandons effort to sell VC portfolio assets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a solution looking for problem where as Amazon Google identify problems first then looking for solution The value is not in problem solving but solving the right problems The folks who know the problem to solve would get to the solution faster <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is lost in the post PC era Surprisingly Microsoft looks to be much better positioned to survive the collapse of the PC market wintel era <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>appears more more vulnerable each day trying to put a strategy together How can a company of its size be so short sighted is beyond my comprehension I always had the impression that post PC era is the Data Center What did you had in your small mind Connecting devices to the web actually is a very powerful tool Who wouldnt want to be able to turn off the stove or coffee maker that had been inadvertently left on while headed to work Or set the teenaged sons alarm clock Maybe unlocking a door of a house to let someone in when physically being present is difficult or impractical Perhaps being guided to an optimal parking spot Maybe being notified when someone enters a particular area or notification of a physician when the blood pressure reading is excessive IoT has very substantial potential to seriously reduce traffic gridlock Turning off a washer if a leak is detected would also be a very desirable function Security is the real issue And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can build a secure IoT chip getting it to the market before anyone else they still can enjoy a very lucrative business IoT chips will go into far more than computers and smartphones Every device appliance monitor and machine would be a candidate for such a chip including every household outlet and light switch The chips are already here and secure Now the fight is who has the best platform to serve the segment from A to Z Amazon Google Apple Are the system integrators trying to solve the problem end to end They are the solution providers These folks do not necessary use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>try to see chips it is IC chip centric rather than creating the whole ecosystem At the end of the day they may end up like what they end up in mobile Irrerational Those companies are lagging the hardware implementation knowledge as well none of them have any clue of security Irrerational Apple is not interested in building chips for IoT They are interested in mobile computing platforms and likely an electric vehicle Google builds TPUs which arent useful in IoT and Google has not shown any interest in selling them either Amazon does not produce chips Samsung might produce its own IoT chips for their own appliances and televisions LG seems to want to get into the chip business But outside of those few companies the market is wide open Leviton GE Agilent Whirlpool Philips Chamberlain and the list goes on and on regarding the lite companies who would benefit from integrating IoT chips into their products The potential market is huge What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has is the old semiconductor mind set Look at Amazon echo and ereader apple IPhone and iwatch fitbit Google will go into anything that helps them in search revenue These companies are closer to the end user Nowadays ICs by itself is not enough you need tight integration between hardware and software In fact the number of software engineers in many projects out number the number of hardware engineers These are not IC companies but could get their chips design if it suits them GE Leviton these are the old classics who charge a premium on what ever they see is smart but Amazon will provide the buttons to order supplies free I wanted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to succeed and has been waiting for too long and giving up on them I recently bought a cloud storage device built with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips that supports K it is real slow and the software is unstable My few years old PC with an NVDA graphics card is still much better I have multiple examples of half bake products using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips that got me no where Irrera Can you please provide me with the name of that cloud storage device I have multiple examples of half bake products using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips that got me no where Also can you please reveal which they are ETF Screener Search and filter by asset class strategy theme performance yield and
