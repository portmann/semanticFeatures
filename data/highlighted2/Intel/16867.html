Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog In recent months Facebook has been quietly holding talks with at least half a dozen media companies about hosting their content inside Facebook rather than making users tap a link to go to an external site The new proposal by Facebook carries another risk for publishers the loss of valuable consumer data When readers click on an article an array of tracking tools allow the host site to collect valuable information on who they are how often they visit and what else they have done on the web And if Facebook pushes beyond the experimental stage and makes content hosted on the site commonplace those who do not participate in the program could lose substantial traffic a factor that has played into the thinking of some publishers Their articles might load more slowly than their competitors and over time readers might avoid those sites From the New York Times article Facebook May Host News Sites Content Last week I came across an incredibly important article from the New York Times which described Facebooks plan to provide direct access to other websites content in exchange for some sort of advertising partnership The implications of this are so huge that at this point I have far more questions than answers Lets start with a fewexcerpts from the article With billion users the social media site has become a vital source of traffic for publishers looking to reach an increasingly fragmented audience glued to smartphones In recent months Facebook has been quietly holding talks with at least half a dozen media companies about hosting their content inside Facebook rather than making users tap a link to go to an external site Such a plan would represent a leap of faith for news organizations accustomed to keeping their readers within their own ecosystems as well as accumulating valuable data on them Facebook has been trying to allay their fears according to several of the people briefed on the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were bound by nondisclosure agreements Facebook intends to begin testing the new format in the next several months according to two people with knowledge of the discussions The initial partners are expected to be The New York Times BuzzFeed and National Geographic although others may be added since discussions are continuing The Times and Facebook are moving closer to a firm deal one person said Facebook has said publicly that it wants to make the experience of consuming content online more seamless News articles on Facebook are currently linked to the publishers own website and open in a web browser typically taking about eight seconds to load Facebook thinks that this is too much time especially on a mobile device and that when it comes to catching the roving eyeballs of readers milliseconds matter The Huffington Post and the business and economics website Quartz were also approached Both also declined to discuss their involvement Facebook declined to comment on its specific discussions with publishers But the company noted that it had provided features to help publishers get better traction on Facebook including tools unveiled in December that let them target their articles to specific groups of Facebook users such as young women living in New York who like to travel The new proposal by Facebook carries another risk for publishers the loss of valuable consumer data When readers click on an article an array of tracking tools allow the host site to collect valuable information on who they are how often they visit and what else they have done on the web And if Facebook pushes beyond the experimental stage and makes content hosted on the site commonplace those who do not participate in the program could lose substantial traffic a factor that has played into the thinking of some publishers Their articles might load more slowly than their competitors and over time readers might avoid those sites And just as Facebook has changed its news feed to automatically play videos hosted directly on the site giving them an advantage compared with videos hosted on YouTube it could change the feed to give priority to articles hosted directly on its site Let me try to address this the best I can from several different angles First off whats the big picture plan here As thenumber two ranked website in the world with billion users Facebook itself is already something like an alternative internet where a disturbing number of individuals spend a disproportionate amount of their time The only thing that seems to make many of its users click away is content hosted on other peoples websites linked to from Facebook users Other than this outside content many FB users might never leave the site While this is scary to someone like me to Facebook it is an abomination The company doesnt want people to leave their site ever for any reason Hence the aggressive push to carry outside news content and create a better positioned alternative webcentrally controlled by it This is a huge power play move Second the New York Timesrighty asks the question concerning what will publishers get from Facebook for allowing their content to appear on the site seamlessly Some sort of revenue share from advertisers seems to be an obvious angle but perhaps theres more While Facebook isnt a huge traffic driver for Liberty Blitzkrieg it isnt totally irrelevant either For example FB providedabout of the sites traffic over the past months This is despite the fact that LBK doesnt even have a Facebook page and Ive never shared a link through it Even more impressive Facebook drove more traffic to LBK over the same time period than Twitter and I am very active on that platform So I can only imagine how important FB is to website editors who actually use it This brings me to akey point about leverage It seems to me that Facebook has all the leverage in negotiations with content providers If youre a news website that refuses to join in this program over time you might see your traffic evaporate compared to your competitors whose content will load seamlessly and be promoted by the FB algorithm If a large percentage of your traffic is being generated by Facebook can you really afford to lose this One thing that FB might be willing to offer publishers in return other than advertising dollars is increased access to their fan base For example when I try to figure out through Google analytics who specifically or what page on Facebook is sharing my work I cant easily do so Clearly this information could prove very useful for networking purposes and could be quite valuable Looking for some additional insight and words of wisdom I asked the smartest techinternet person I know for his opinion It was more optimistic than I thought Other than saying that I dont really know how to predict what might or might not happen and I sort of dont care much because it is in the realm for now at least of stuff that I dont read mainstream news on a site that I never see Facebook However the one thing I wonder in terms of the viability of this is whether in the end itmay drive people away from FB Back in the day probably when you werent so aware of the nascent net there were two giant services on the Internet called Compuserve and America Online They were each what you are thinking that Facebook is heading toward exclusive centralized portals to the whole net They were also giant and successful at the time Then people outside of them started doing things that were so much more creative and interesting At the same time in order to make everything fit inside their proprietary boxes and categories they were making everything ever more standardized and boring Then they just abruptly died Given the enormity of what Facebook is trying to achieve I have some obvious concerns First since all of the leverage seems to reside with Facebook I fear they are likely to get the better part of any deal by wide margin Second if they succeed in this push this single companys ability to control access to news and what is trending and deemed important by a huge section of humanity will be extraordinary Sun Jonesy Sun chilli sauce Im making over k a month working part time I kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so I decided to look into it Well it was all true and has totally changed my life This is what I do wwwjobsreviewcom Sun COSMOS Call it what it is Joobook Another way to control how you perceive the world Fucklebergsteinowitz can take a hike The MSM is dying Facebook has plateued However the risk is great to both parties What happens when users hijack the message And how do they control feedback You know you really dont need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this Mon Macchendra And honestly the goy version of this classmatescom had been around for ages stinking up your spam folder Thank God the MBAs didnt win this battle They would have monetized it to death And YOUR opinion has benefited YOU have been given a voice Yes this is all about control of the message They are loosing control this is one option theyve chosen and theyll attempt to vilify any and all alternate sources This attack on RT is another skirmish in the war for your minds httprtcomshowscrosstalkmediaeunatous maybe lesser known sites

cant remember the username or password or email account that I made up the last time I was forced to use it so I just make up another one Which I promptly forget again because I never use it When you hear your teenage kids say Facebook Facebook SUCKS you know its over for them MSM wants to funnel their feces through FB Hey Im all for it More power to them I would rather have ALL the knuckledraggers selfconfined to their own little cage somewhere on the periphery of the internet than wandering around loose and showing up on worthwhile sites Like I would ever even bother to make up yet another fake account on Facebook to read somethign like the NYT WSJ WaPo Bussiness Insider etc etc etc Sun bag holder This sounds exactly like America Online back in the s They tried to create their own selfcontained Internet too It didnt exactly end well Sun inmayshun Half the people I know already ditched FB for Instagram The other half were smart enough never to join FB Mon XqWretch Sun Lone_Star Sun sun tzu Sun MsCreant I dont have an account or go there at all Would it be subversive to create lots and lots of accounts I wonder Lloyds excluding damages from nonionizing radiation on

planet then lets see em brag about billion users even XY billion active users would be plainly seen as having no providence Mon XqWretch Mon glenlloyd I suppose it could in a way exert an influence on what people read but I would guess that the percentage of people who wish to reside completely on the FB site is not all that large and I cant think that this is really an audience worth persuing tbh Others who figure out that their typical sources of media are being throttled will seek out those sources outside the facebook site and it might cause them to think twice about how much time they spend there or whether FB really has anything to offer For FB Im in the same camp as the Internet guru I think it could end up biting FB in the assin the end Mon SHRAGS Apathy passive eye candy Celeb sex active type clickbait model They are betting a large percentage of user are apathetic to going outside FB They would already have a good idea of their users psych profile Sun Boondocker And now that I read this article Im terrified ZH might not appear on it Sounds like really important and stuff Sun bunnyswanson Despite the attempt to turn Americans into the bad guy as their govt plows through one nation after another stealing resources killing everyone in site and leaving those still half alive in rubble FB has allowed us here in America and Canada to reveal the real story We do not talk about our families jobs or dinner We post news links Sun OldPhart Mon TheReplacement Good for you I suppose I cant be bothered with Facebook for the simple reason I cant be bothered with Facebook or MySpace before that anyone remember MySpace or AOL before that When you speak to people face to face you can better judge if they heard you or if they were listening All the same it doesnt seem likely to matter Have you contemplated just how much you do not and cannot know The whole thing is mindboggling in scale and scope and the intricate webs of alliances and deceit is beyond comprehension And that is the good news It is too complex Everything is too complex People fashion TPTB as some sort of continuation of the Nazis of old and even further back Yes this does seem to be the case However the Nazis used slave labor to build complex weapons systems that were too heavy for a lot of ground that needed to be fought over mechanically unreliable too complex to manufacture in mass quantities quickly and required extensive training for an ever dwindling number of soldiers capable of learning to use the systems while being loyal and contientious they impressed captured soldiers from one front to fight on another against a different enemy Does that sounds familiar How many Abrams and Apaches can we churn out Can an Abrams get everywhere it might need to go Those fields in Donbass looked awfully muddy Just how fast can we make these tanks now that our auto industry is just about gonesky How much effort does it take to maintain and supply the Abrams and Apache Do any Chinese components go into that tank or helo How about software from other countries How much does it cost how long does it take and what are the requirements for a tanker or helo crew We have plenty of people who can read write and speak english and for sure they are totally like loyal and everything right Care to compare the monetary or financial systems How about police and surviellance Regulations and social justice Fanaticisms Fearloathing of the other Mon bunnyswanson Sharing links and making observations is hardly talking to each other And if the FBI is reading our news feeds then they should realize that only a fool would not object to the real news Remember when the number of people in the demonstrations reaches million the cops change sides When the cops change sides its over for the couple thousand at the top of this pyramid made from blood sweat and tears of generations The end is going to be the same for Americans I am a Canadian in America And I strongly feel that every american no matter their income is going to be answering to the Chinese govt officials by the time they wrap this up Americans are going to be responsible for the debt their politicians racked up Just like Greece Elimination of the middle class is not something to take lying down if you care at all about humanity and what our actions today will do to future humans on this planet China is not a nice country Mon bunnyswanson What is there to know Father was given an ambassorship by Canadian govt in his industry mining when he was needed to do a complex job during a deep freeze and broken water main ice filled mine shaft During that trip from Sudbury in Johnstown PA a mining accident occurred resulting in a bucket of several tons of muck falling feet down a shaft onto the heads of men one of whom had children and who was also the superintendent of the drilling company sinking the shaft My father was in Pittsburgh when it happened The coal miners refused to go down the hole They called and asked my father who did httpwwwcamgenpacomnewsTDhtml He sautered the bucket back onto the same crane and went down numerous times but when it came time to bring up the deceased drillers the company boss decided he had the courage and the media coverage was called in My dad was devastated But the company offered him the job of the superintendent and gave him and his family life long visas He traveled to other countries and left my us in a very small town Mother decided to spend her time at the bar The towns people raised me fed me let me sleep there took me to doctor stores and never made me feel badly about my fractured family and empty home They were Polish Slovadian Filipino Italian and back in the people were very kind hard working honest and private I know enough that I have gratitude toward the Americans for keeping me from going where I should have gone considering the situation They showed me love And I plan on doing what I can to see to it that these people are not punished for what their govt and big money interests have done in their name They do not deserve this Mon bunnyswanson There is no hero who is going to come and save the day If the global community turns its back on your country when the real reason for combat equipment and enough ammo to wipe out the entire population the surveillance and the FEMA camps the gloves will come off and the Rich Kid on the Block will be put in his place with the techniques used by the US soldiers deemed torture With the bankers and the manipulation going on going unreported by MSM everywhere FB is the only choice Huffpo may have been once but that quickly changed when AH joined AOL ZH commentors who down vote me and yet scream on these threads condemnation must be in the library because boys it is the same fucking thing Mon bunnyswanson Re Chinese I just happened to a little bit as I was a roommate of a youg Chinese woman who married her way into America to a Mormon missionary She came from Utah after in a matter of months her husband left her She was crying on her American boss shoulder shortly thereafter and allowed him to set her up in an apartment completely furnished It did not work out she said because he expected her to sleep with him It was not in her plans She roomed with me after getting a job as an exporter at a produce operation I watched her in months set up export businesses and take her companys clients file and start her own exporting operation with the separate businesses bidding against each other She had the state of mind that she could do whatever she wanted her that the people in this country owe her because of her govts generosity She displayed contempt toward Americans and had no qualms in stating so She was the daughter of a military man who was forced to work in the fields and not pursue his talent art One child policy has created little emperors and princesses I cant say for sure as Ive never visited the site Based on what Ive gleaned contextually from people talkingwriting about it it appears to be a holding pen for human cattle Mon COSMOS Time to switch and put them back where they started I hear young people are moving
