we received an official announcement from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC that it would be purchasing Altera NASDAQ ALTR The deal will combine Intels manufacturing power with a strong product portfolio from Altera in an effort to meet the needs of data center and Internet of Things customers Now that a proposed deal is in place Id like to detail my thoughts on the combination The presentation slides state that the deal is expected to be accretive to nonGAAP EPS and free cash flow in the first year after closing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has stuck to GAAP results unlike a number of technology companies that like to exclude certain costs like sharebased compensation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has reported restructuring costs in its GAAP results in recent years but Im guessing that it will break out Altera deal specific costs in the short term Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>didnt state the deal will be accretive to GAAP EPS initially we can most likely figure that the EPS figure will be hurt by the deal in the short term Intels main focus on the deal is data center and IoT two segments that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is targeting for future growth When the company reported Q results the Data Center Group DCG reported more than revenue growth over the prior year period That growth followed the more than top line increase for the segment in The IoT segment also showed a small double digit revenue increase in Q Focusing on these growth segments helps reduce the companys reliance on the PC space which got <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in trouble during early When you look at Intels new reporting segments the DCG was the most profitable one in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will take on a bit of debt to complete this deal if approved It will be interesting to see how much money is borrowed and at what rates US Treasury rates have jumped in recent weeks which increases Intels borrowing costs If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were to borrow billion at an average cost of youd be talking about million in annual pretax interest costs or about per share An alternative use of that money would have been to buy back shares However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>uses the buyback as its last use of cash CFO Stacy Smith reiterated on the most recent conference call And just coming on the last part of your question John we as Brian said our priority is to invest in the business first dividend second and then we use the buyback to modulate cash balances <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>increased its buyback last year and accelerated some repurchases in the second half of You can expect that buybacks will slow down going forward if the company takes out as much debt as expected The buyback would have helped with the EPS while the Altera deal will help with the revenues first and hopefully with the EPS over time I cant say at this time how much of an impact on the dividend there will be until we see if the deal goes through how much debt is taken on and how results are impacted At the moment I have to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing what it needs to and that is focusing on data center and IoT Time will tell if the price was too high as detailed by an analyst at Citigroup At the purchase price Alteras Enterprise ValueEBITDA ratio for the trailing twelve months is about compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at around Those that believe in capital returns would argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could have used these funds for the buyback but that doesnt help the business in the long run <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needed to reduce its reliance on the PC space and hopefully the Altera purchase will do just that Source IntelAltera My Thoughts On The Proposed Deal Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks
