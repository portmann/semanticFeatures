market for the company and will cause revenue acceleration Silicom Ltd NASDAQ SILC is an offthebeatentrack Israeli company that benefits from the same growth drivers as security vendors such as Check Point Software NASDAQ CHKP Fortinet NASDAQ FTNT and Palo Alto Networks NYSE PANW The company supplies network interface cards NICs that go into bare slots in its customers network appliances and provide various types of functionalities to the appliances such as bypass and CPU offload Silicom has a history of terrific revenue growth with a CAGR from to The last two years have been tougher with a growth rate each year So what caused the slowdown in growth and what can reignite sales growth for the company Silicoms main end markets until recently were WAN Optimization and application delivery controllers ADCs These markets were both growing at a clip during Silicoms growth years and the company added incremental growth by growing its customer base and introducing new products More recently these markets have slowed down considerably as they have matured and their penetration rates have increased In addition Silicoms more recent products have been more sophisticated technologically and had more features leading to longer design cycles with its customers Last year Silicom missed a design win on a continuing product causing it to miss Q This year it missed Q because a large customer was bought by a private equity firm and it drew down existing inventories before buying new parts from Silicom So exiting this SILC history lesson where does this lead us going forward Silicom rebounded from its Q miss this year with a revenue growth quarter in Q Granted the comparison was easy with last year but the quarter got the company back of the growth trajectory it had in Q Management guided to m in revenue for Q a sequential increase from Q Given the historical Q sequential revenue increases in and I think this years guidance is extremely conservative Silicom launched a timestamp product for the network management and financial markets two years ago At the time it predicted that the products could add m to its run rate in a years time These products have been at customer labs in the interim and were even designed into a product that has yet to launch Timestamp has disappointed investors and management but I view it currently as a free option since there is no revenue from it built into my model and each win could be sized at m and above Security is a end market for Silicom now and is growing quickly Customers my guess not verified by management such as Cisco NASDAQ CSCO SourceFire acquired by Cisco McAfee Juniper HP Tippingpoint etc have designed in Silicom cards to their appliances As this market becomes a larger piece of Silicoms revenue stream overall revenue should accelerate Security is a crucial priority for CIOs now and they will continue to spend regardless of the overall tepid world economic growth Network Function Virtualization NFV is a hot topic in the tech world today What this means is the ability to separate the software that creates the desired function from the underlying hardware Basically it will allow customers to use commodity hardware in conjunction with security or ADC software instead of using hardware appliances supplied by the security or ADC vendor Silicoms NICs are still relevant in this environment because the commodity servers need to have the input output functionality that they provide One target customer base that SILC has not yet penetrated is the Web market Potential customers like Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebook NASDAQ FB are putting together their own hardware and represent a huge opportunity for Silicom if the company can get its foot in the door It is working on this angle but have reminded me that it could be a long process to a design win This again seems like another free option as no one is expecting the company to acquire these customers at all So if I am right and Silicoms revenue growth gets back to a healthy level the stock will be meaningfully higher than here given its current x PE ratio exits net cash While not likely I think there is a scenario where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC purchases Silicom at some point down the road The companys products are mostly based on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chipsets and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some competing NICs Silicoms product line could greatly enhance Intels product breadth Obviously given Intels balance sheet even pro forma for the Altera acquisition it could pay a nice premium for the company We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
