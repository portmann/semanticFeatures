from last years share Strategy Analytics also predicts that Windows tablets will sell million units this year and million by I believe Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT will reap longterm benefits from Windows in tablets Strategy Analytics published a report that Windows tablet sales already posted a yearoveryear increase in tablet sales during the first nine months of This positive trend could continue well into the future The holiday shopping season could deliver Strategy Analytics estimate that Windows will grab of tablet sales this year Windows only had share in tablet sales last Q Some of the million Windows tablets that Strategy Analytics estimated will get sold by the end of FY are Microsoft Surface products Microsoft needs this positive development to offset its declining Lumia sales Investors should care that Windows tablets are gaining market share It helps ease the pain from the fact that Windows now has less market share in smartphones versus three years ago Steve Ballmers gamble in buying Nokias NYSE NOK phone business is panning out disastrously Microsofts billion writeoff of its Lumia business shows that Satya Nadella is pessimistic over Microsofts future as a phone hardware vendor He and I know that subsidizing Lumia phones is a longterm losing proposition for Microsoft Strategy Analytics believes that Windows is fast becoming a premium OS for higherASP tablets Windows will allegedly gradually grab market share away from dirtcheap Android tablets The chart below predicts that Windows could get almost of annual tablet sales by From this year Windows share in tablet OS will supposedly grow to by Consequently the average lowerASP Androids share will dwindle to On the other hand this fouryear forecast of Strategy Analytics might still be lower than what Windows could gain in the future I reiterate my opinion that like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apple NASDAQ AAPL will also lose market share in tablets There are now more useful enterprisecentric Windows hybrid tablets like the Surface The Surface could render more expensive iPads very unattractive to business users I believe Strategy Analytics is incorrect in its prediction that Apple will still grow its tablet share from now to by This is contrary to current reality For the past two years iPad unit sales have posted doubledigit declines Aside from a serious price markdowns Apple has nothing left to make its iPad more attractive to consumers The Surface with Microsoft Type coverkeyboard is certainly more useful than the iPad Pro without keyboard for most people As long as Tim Cook is in charge of Apple the next models of ARMbased iPads will continue to lose ground in the enterprise against cheaper Windows in alternatives I therefore guesstimate that iPads could lose market share by or more to Windows tablets Windows not iOS could have share in tablet sales four years from now The iPad Pro is a weak answer to the Surface ProSurface Book The entrylevel iPad Mini also has tough competition from highquality but cheaper Windows inch tablets like Xiaomis Mi Pad By virtue of its highmargin policy Apple is unlikely to match the pricing strategy of Xiaomi for Windows tablets The decline in iPads market share will likely continue well into also due to other factors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is still willing to sell subsidized nanometer Cherry Trail Atom processors to manufacturers of Windows tablets Why Windows Is Growing On Tablets But Not On Smartphones Going forward I expect Microsoft to permanently let its OEM tablet partners thrive on lowermargin tablets and in laptops The reason why the Lumia business is dying is that Microsoft tried to compete with Android phones Thirdparty OEMs hate it when Microsoft itself competes against their entrylevel and midrange products Microsofts future as a hardware vendor is to be more like Apple focus only on highermargin products OEMs will produce Windows tablets if they do not get backstabbed by a Microsoftmade Surface tablet Nadella should also try the Surface brand for Microsofts next flagship Windows phones The Lumia brand is now damaged goods due to it being associated with phones Surface is now the brand associated with premiumluxury hardware products MSFT is worth a longterm hold Windows growing market share in tablets is a silver lining in Microsofts struggle on mobile If Microsoft cannot make it big in phones the bigger need there is for it to improve its popular highpriced Surface product portfolio Microsoft still needs a healthy tabletcomputer business to help it replace the lost revenue from giving away free Windows OS licenses Furthermore expanding its popular Surface brand to cover not just tablets is also highly desirable for Microsoft Not all business or enterprise users gets rewarded with a laptop The majority of working stiffs in the office are often stuck with desktop tower PCs or allinone computers I look forward to Microsoft also
