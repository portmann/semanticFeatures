Samsungs mobile phone growth hurts Qualcomms chipset shipments The more mobile phone share Apple and Samsung control the less DRAM demand there is for Micron DRAM contract prices down in Q are expected to decline further Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has a problem with its topline growth For fiscal Q revenue from its licensing division QTL was up sequentially Its chipset division QCT which generates the lions share of sales experienced a revenue decline of QCTs problems are twofold average sales price ASP and unit sales are declining ASP fell to while chipset shipments fell about to million in FQ visavis FQ During its Q earnings call management crystallized the problem While we are ahead of our expectations in the first half of the fiscal year we are guiding the second half lower due to a number of factors in QCT First the extent of the impact of OEM concentration at the premium tier and the impact of share loss in the Galaxy S and Note Second the altered launch plans of the OEMs in the premium tier with some OEMs delaying launches and then OEM rationalizing their portfolio by deemphasizing designs using our legacy parts By premium tier management was referring to Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Samsung OTC SSNLF the two leading mobile phone manufacturers Prior to replacing Qualcomms snapdragon processor for its inhouse Exynos processor Samsung represented over of Qualcomms revenue Apple is now Qualcomms largest customer However Apple only buys modems and does not utilize the companys higher margin snapdragon processors Qualcomm is in effect caught between Apple Samsung and a hard place The more Samsung increases its smartphone market share the more Qualcomms unit sales decline As Apples smartphone share increases it hurts Qualcomms ASP DRAM represents about of Microns NASDAQ MU billion in quarterly revenue In an attempt to expand its semiconductor operations Samsung has expanded its share in DRAM from in Q to in Q Microns share declined from to over that period And it could get worse particularly in mobile DRAM Samsung is rumored to supply the lions share of DRAM for Apples iPhone S due out Q According to Trendforce Apple and Samsung controlled about of all smartphone shipments in Q By rekindling its relationship with Apple Samsung has practically ring fenced manufacturers representing nearly half the mobile phone market Microns Qualcomm problem is that the more market share Apple and Samsung take from competitors the less DRAM demand there is for Micron And investors have punished the stock Over the past months MU is down nearly versus an gain for the SP SPX Yet all is not lost Micron bulls like Seeking Alphas William Tidwell point to the vaunted second half rebound So heres my bull case for a stock in Micron will report ok numbers in Q decently good numbers in Q and blow the roof off in Q of as the PC market recovers after the W release However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC recently threw the kibosh on the Windows pent up demand thesis And with a reported million preorders for Samsungs blockbuster Galaxy S there could be less mobile DRAM to sell to manufacturers not named Apple or Samsung In addition to an expected decline in Micron DRAM demand in the second half of prices are declining According to Kevin Rottinghaus of Cleveland Research DRAM contract prices declined by as much as to around in Q Competitor SK Hynix OTC HXSCF experienced a sequential decline in its DRAM ASP in Q Meanwhile Drexel Hamilton expects DRAM price cuts to deepen due to Samsungs willingness to accept lower margins while it hikes output Qualcomm is caught between Apple Samsung and a hard place Whether Microns management admits to a similar dilemma remains to be seen I continue to rate MU a hold Editors
