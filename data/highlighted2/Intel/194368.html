#A9E2F3'>Intel </span>launched its th generation Skylake processor a month ago and major OEMs will launch a host of laptops powered by the processor this month The obvious question now is where does Skylake fit into the HaswellBroadwell equation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC launched its Core ik Skylake processor a month ago In August the chipmaker revealed at the gaming tradeshow Gamescon in Germany that the sixth generation Skylake processors in the form of Core iK and Core iK are coming The wait is over Major OEMs such as HP NYSE HPQ and Dell will launch a host of laptops powered by the th generation Skylake processors this month Selling Skylake could be a challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>given it has also launched lots of CPUs based on Broadwell earlier this year Since Skylake represents a giant leap with microarchitecture redesign industry observers will closely watch whether the successor to the Broadwell microarchitecture a tock in the Intels ticktock cadence succeeds in attracting customers amid an unfavorable economic climate particularly outside the US Where does Skylake fit into the HaswellBroadwell equation Broadwell the codename of Intels th generation microarchitecture is actually the nanometer die shrink successor of the companys th generation Haswell microarchitecture Skylake is Intels th generation microarchitecture which also uses the nanometer manufacturing process like Broadwell Earlier this year in January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>launched new dualcore mobile processors ranging from CeleronPentium to Core i i and i based on Broadwell microarchitecture In June the company launched new quadcore desktop and mobile processors based on the same microarchitecture This in essence means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has rolled out almost the full family of Broadwell processors in phases throughout the year only the highest end version of Broadwell will be coming in the first quarter of or slightly later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>didnt launch any lowend desktop processors based on Broadwell the previous generation Haswell will continue to fill that space With Broadwell involving a die shrink over nanometer Haswell a tick in the Intels ticktock sequence the th generation processors launched throughout the year are smaller with improved battery life As far as performance is concerned Haswellbased tablets laptops and desktops are fast enough for everyday computing including media performance However Broadwell is certainly capable of delivering improved graphics performance particularly for highend gaming The moot question however is where does Skylake fit into the HaswellBroadwell equation Many industry watchers believe the process shrink to nanometer didnt translate into improvement in longevity with Broadwell I am almost sure the same old question will be asked again for Skylake will it lead to improved longevity I believe it will Why Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>promised Skylake will deliver performance improvement and battery life improvement over Broadwell With such improvement in performance I am sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has also dealt with the longevity issue with microarchitecture redesign Sadly this wont solve the actual question where does Skylake fit into the equation To be more specific with the HaswellBroadwell duo delivering great performance in every facet of computing from improved battery life to improved media and graphics performance why would people opt for Skylake Those who have already been shifted to Broadwell what would drive them to discard it and upgrade to Skylake when its been only a few months they have been shifted to Broadwell On top of that upgrading will be costly since Skylake requires new motherboard with microarchitecture redesign Further since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont launch the highest end version of Broadwell before the first quarter of Haswell will continue to be sold With Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT offering free upgrade to Windows which the company claims doesnt require processor upgrade there is a possibility that existing HaswellBroadwell users wont get enough incentive to upgrade to Skylake However Skylake offers a few features that are absent in the earlier generations such as Thunderbolt data transfer DDR memory support wireless charging and enhanced security using biometric authentication Kirk Skaugen the general manager of Intels Client Computing Group said that Windows and Skylake processors were designed together He said in an interview This is something that only happens once every decade or so Skaugen believes Skylake along with Windows will drive positive sales for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft Some industry insiders I know believe that Skylake will eventually have a negative impact on Broadwell sales since Skylake offers advanced features as just mentioned However I dont think it would be as simple as that An article in VR World opined that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might have done with the ticktock strategy at least for the time being An excerpt from the article The slowdown or a dissolve of TickTock cadence is set to continue in and as recently Benchlifeinfo leaked that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>plans to introduce Kaby Lake yet another nm processor This would mean <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cadence finally slowed from TickTock to Tock Sandy Bridge nm Tick Ivy Bridge nm Tock Haswell nm Tick Broadwell nm Tock or Tick Skylake nm Tick Kaby Lake nm Tick Ice Lake nm Tick Cannonlake nm Thats a whole lot of ticks Yes lots of ticks are in the offing The fact is that going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to sell older version processors even when it will launch newer versions This is a marketing strategy known as product differentiation With its competitors offering similar processors product differentiation will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>retain market share Launch of Skylake will mark a new era for Intels microprocessor marketing strategy wherein HaswellBroadwellSkylake will coexist together and this is just the beginning I strongly believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to lead the microprocessor market in the foreseeable future Its shares are trading at oneyear forward price to earnings multiple of x and at oneyear forward price to sales multiple of x which imply they are reasonably valued Intels strong product pipeline including Kaby Lake Ice Lake and Cannonlake makes it a screaming buy We only use your contact details to
