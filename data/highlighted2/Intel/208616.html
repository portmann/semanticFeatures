<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reportedly has people working on iPhone solutions Thats too many for only modem design they could be working on Apple An too Powering all iPads and iPhones would translate into roughly billion of revenues Intels nm and nm look to be a lot more dense than the competitors FinFET production and Apple knows that If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could win modem production and eventually SoC it will be able to exploit the Apple exposure to attract more customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has always had problems entering the smartphone market It will probably achieve good results with its SoFIA offering in the lowend and midend market but for the highend market it will have to wait some more Recent news makes me think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could enter the highend smartphone market as a producer of modems and application processors A source stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reportedly has people working on the next iPhone LTE modem which could replace the Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ QCOM one This product would be built with a nm technology node directly in Intels foundries and it would generate more than billion per year in revenues for the smartphone sector Intels advantage consists of the fact that its nm process is considered to be cleaner and product efficient In addition it obtains smaller sizes pitch gate length gate and so on providing higher density and lower power consumption take a look here for nm and nm effective specs There was a similar rumor last year but it concerned only the possibility of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>using its modems directly inside iPhones without any kind of specific info The rumor looks quite strong and it seems that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is using massive human resources to meet Apples NASDAQ AAPL expectations If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to win the modem design for the next few years I would not be surprised to see Intels modems even in future iPads Its true that the tablet business is plunging but it would be an additional good revenue source and it would help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>grow its brand even in the smartphone and tablet market Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is using massive human resources it probably means that the Santa Clara company strongly believes in this project and sees it as a good business I agree with this opinion Given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may have people working on iPhone solutions its hard to think that they are all focused only on modem development What about SoC development Its clear that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm foundries are good Given the recent problems from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd OTC SSNLF foundries but I have some doubts since the latest Toms Hardware article shows how the Samsung SoC provides lower power consumption not higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could partially substitute the Korean company to produce the Apple An SoCs Apple generally prefers to have multiple suppliers for those components that are likely to have lower production yields so I would expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to join TSMC in Apple An production for the first time Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has very good foundries it could even completely substitute competitors in Apple SoC production in the future if it can provide sufficient guarantees The same source states that Apple is evaluating the chance of directly requesting an LTE modem integrated into the Apple An SoC That arrangement would obviously improve efficiency and power consumption while lowering the motherboard complexity At the same time it has a specific drawback on heat generation when the integrated modem works it produces consistent heat even at nm and it would force the SoC to slow down to meet TDP specifications From that point of view it could be problematic and Im not sure that Apple would follow such a route This is the most interesting aspect If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wins the modem designproduction and the SoC production things would become more interesting from the point of view of the SoC design Apple A SoC costs between to Apple itself which is a normal price for topend SoCs It means that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>produces the Apple An it will not be able to charge higher prices The same would happen even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>joins Apple in RD for a future mobile x processor or a topend Atom SoC On the contrary Apple could lower RD costs and exploit the entire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>platform synergy Its obvious that such a scenario would happen only if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can provide a very competitive SoC design in terms of performance power consumption and costs Such a scenario would bring a possible convergence of OSx and iOS operative systems andor related programs Its true that Tim Cook said he does not want to merge the two operating systems but it does not mean that they cannot use a similar architecture if performance is suitable enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working hard in the mobile field Achieving modems and SoCs sales in Apple iPhones and iPads would bring strong revenues possibly around billion per year which would be a massive improvement for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the mobile business At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would enjoy very good media exposure through Apple attracting more mobile customers since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is building up a whole offering from lowend to highend areas in the smartphone market Such a scenario would push Intels stock price to higher values and it would eliminate Intels burden of being unsuccessful in the smartphone field In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has good chances of becoming an important player in the mobile market its probably only a matter of time Competitors such as Qualcomm and Samsung should worry a lot if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wins modem production for iPhone and iPad it would be the ultimate spark of a radical change Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities
