NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Sep PM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation INTC Includes ARMH ATML FSL MCHP NXP QCOM STM by Robert Castellano Intels Atom and Quark are positioning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to move beyond its Wintel legacy products MCUs will play a dominant role in smart technologyIoT despite falling average selling prices Intels NASDAQ INTC Atom has had a storied past Introduced in its primary use was for lowpower netbooks But netbooks used primarily to surf the net only lasted a few years until tablets entered the scene I was never a proponent of Atom and wrote a series of articles in Seeking Alpha pointing out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was losing money on each Atom sold because the company was utilizing expensive fab space and equipment to commit to manufacturing these devices at the expense of significantly more expensive MPUs A December article in Seeking Alpha continued my argument wherein the author noted that For the past months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has lost roughly B in the development and selling of Atom into the mobile space Now Atom will be snuffed out in the course of the next months as the new nm Broadwell and Skylake processors are iterated in various die sizes hitting the extremes of price and performance As usual great executives at great companies adjust to adverse conditions Just a few months later in February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced the Atom x x and x processors According to Intels website This change will start with the next generation of processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom x processor provides basic but genuine Intellevel tablet phablet and smartphone performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom x processor has more capabilities and features for people who want an even better experience and the flagship <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom x processor provides the highest level of performance and capabilities for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom family The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom processor is designed to provide the best battery life with great performance for tablets phablets smartphones and other mobile devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is positioning itself to move beyond the Wintel era and dreams of replacing ARM in mobile devices Im talking about really big markets not the million PCs or the billion smartphones sold in and whether the Atom will be used in any of them going forward Im talking about IoT Internet of Things and wearables According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fifty billion connected devices are expected by Yes I know Im speaking of volumes not revenues and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes significantly more money on PC and server sales These represent of sales whereas IoT represents less than But thats the present not the future and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is thinking about the future Besides lowcost Atoms are only part of IoT as shown in Figure below The lowcost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips which are the focus of this article represent an integral part of Intels IoT strategy which will utilize higher cost higher profit and lower volume chips including server chips We also need to consider Intels FPGAs from newly acquired Altera NASDAQ ALTR and other hardware and software platforms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is looking at the big picture and future growth not just a bunch of cheap Atom chip sales On March during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Spain one of the announcements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made was to introduce the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom x Processor Series its first integrated communication platform Formerly code named SoFIA the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom x Processor Series is a lowcost SoC with bit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom processor cores and integrated cellular baseband modem for smart or feature phones phablets and tablets The SoC will be available in G LTE and G versions At the heart of IoT systems is a processor unit that processes data and runs software stacks interfaced to a wireless device for connectivity Advanced IoT sensor nodes consolidate sensor functions and use either an bit MCU or a bit device to run a small RF protocol stack These features are incorporated in the XC processor as shown in the highlevel block diagram below For IoT applications RFID NFC WiFi Bluetooth including Bluetooth Low Energy XBee Zigbee ZWave and Wireless MBus and wired links such as Ethernet HomePlug HomePNA HomeGridGhn and LonWorks are used for shortrange applications primarily from the gateway to the smart device According to a report from The Information Networktitled Convergence of Semiconductors and Smart Technology A Market Analysis connectivity will represent of ICs used in smart technology from the sensor node to the gateway For longerrange and widearea links existing mobile networks currently use GSM GPRS G LTE or WiMAX and satellite connections which provide connectivity to the Internet and cloud services Nodes and gateways must be designed to minimize power consumption provide reliable and robust network connections and extend wireless connectivity range as far as possible The big market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and other IC suppliers for smart technologyIoT are MCUs and MPUs Microcontroller sales in grew to billion a record high to be followed by increases of and in and respectively Shipments are also expected to post healthy gains climbing to billion units in but the average selling price dropped This year ASPs are expected to drop to about but these are predominantly lowend MCUs used for example in smart cards and manufactured by Microchip Technology NASDAQ MCHP and Renasas Smart technologyIoT devices will still contain a mixture of bit and bit MCUs for years to come The latter is a market where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has an opportunity to penetrate against the likes of ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH MCUs manufactured by STMicroelectronics NYSE STM Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Atmel NASDAQ ATML and Freescale NYSE FSL which will merge with NXP Semiconductors NYSE NXP and Renesas with its Synergy Platform The growth of smart technologyIoT will propel MCUs into edge devices and gateways as chip suppliers enhance performance by putting greater integration on the chip like wireless connectivity Figure below from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sums it up MCUs will be ubiquitous in all facets of the IoT Growth in MCUs for smart technologyIoT spreads across a variety of many applications including cities transport health homesbuildings and industry The greatest growth will be exhibited by homesbuildings with a CAGR of between and according to the report from The Information Network as shown in Figure below The Health sector of smart technologyIoT should exhibit strong growth and many of the devices will be in the form of wearables I wrote in a previous article in Seeking Alpha in January that the healthcare industry is one of the biggest opportunities for wearables According to The Information Networks report Wearables Electronics and Semiconductor Markets the wearable market will bifurcate into two camps Those with a wow factor will falter and go the way of the tablet which we forecast to exhibit flat sales over the next several years These devices include wearable cameras and sportsactivity trackers However the other camp of wearables will grow strongly focusing on the healthcare industry and smartwatches The healthcare industry is one of the biggest opportunities for wearables which will be used to provide data management and display systems enabling doctors to handle the flood of electronic health data and access it when they need it while examining a patient Here again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has an opportunity with its Curie module a buttonsized computing module for wearable devices It incorporates a bit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Quark SoC KB flash memory and KB SDRAM a lowpower integrated DSP sensor hub Bluetooth LE chip axis sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope and a batterycharging circuitry Intels Quark SoC X application processor is a bit singlecore singlethread <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Pentium processor instruction set architecture ISAcompatible operating at speeds up to MHz Again as with the MCUs for smart technology and higher upstream opportunities higher performance chips in Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is combining the wearable market with its strategy of interconnectivity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working hard developing this strategy such as the acquisition of smartwatch maker Basis Science and a partnership with Fossil NASDAQ FOSL to build more fashionable wearables So far it has been disappointing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is thinking outside the box and long term with its IoT and wearable strategies It is thinking about the future as technology moves away from a Winteldominated legacy business Investors need to think the same They also need to put things in perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is big and revenues in billions of dollars are thrown around quarterly But even one billion dollars is huge Microchip Technology MCHP for example only sells MCUs sold billion last fiscal year Yes its stock is down YTD but Intels is down In a recent article in Seeking Alpha the author noted that Investors need not tear down Intels efforts in the IoTwearable markets because revenues wont be more than a few billion dollars Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself
