plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Ending inventory is above CFOs previous projections <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC reported earnings last week and sold off on the news as has been discussed by various authors on Seeking Alpha The one thing missing from the analysis about revenue growth EBITDA and products is the amount of inventory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has sitting on its balance sheet I first wrote an article concerning this last summer COGSBeginning Inventory Purchases Cost to Manufacture Ending Inventory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>of course had a different take on why the gross margin rose which can be found here on pages Some investors previously thought that Intels cost of purchases cost to manufacture would drop as it manufactured more nm chips <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provided this reason for part of the gross margin expansion While lower production costs are unquestionably good and this figure did drop from Q it was still above levels From the Q conference call transcript Stacy Smith Intels CFO says Im predicting that well end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today not dramatically different But again units will be down dollars will be flat In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had billion in inventory it finished Q with billion a increase Source IMetrix I did not find the issue of the inventory levels addressed in the Q conference call transcript The Q transcript had this to say How is the channel looking right now and what sort of expectation should we have for your internal inventory looking into this year Thanks Sure We believe that ended with I would just call it very healthy inventories In fact one of the things we saw was a slight decrease in the inventory levels as we exited the fourth quarter If you take a look at what we had originally projected and what would have been more an industry norm would have been a slight increase in inventory We expect those kind of healthy inventory levels to extend through There is no sign that anybody is adding inventory or not moving of a cautious position on inventory and that is what has been built into our forecast as well Yes To the question on internal inventory levels I would just say we ended Q with a little more inventory than I was expecting and a little higher than I would like Two drivers there we saw as I said a little bit weaker units so we made up for us in rich mix a little bit weaker unit and we saw yields get better on nanometer and the combination of that little more inventory leaving Q than I would like You will see it on a dollar basis will go up in Q as a result of Altera so Altera will cause the inventory levels to go up some but when you look at it from a business standpoint I think we will work through the inventory we have and when we get into the back half of the year we will bring inventory levels down COGSBeginning Inventory Purchases Cost to Manufacture Ending Inventory Hence as ending inventory levels are lowered in the nd half of the COGS will rise and likely lower gross margins which is also dependent upon depreciation and amortization levels This appears to be a mean reverting time series So I did some statistical testing I found the presence of mean version to be statistically significant Source IMetrix Gretl Software V is Intels Gross Margin The formula for the mean reversion level is Level Constant Coefficient st Lagged Variable For the whole time series from this would compute to From the mean reversion level is data not shown The question is Is a new era for Intels gross margin or did the extraordinary stimulus both monetary fiscal boost margins Source IMetrix Authors calculations The days it takes to sell inventory has been rising in this new era on a trailing month basis Source IMetrix ARSalesLeft Axis DSO Right Axis This data suggests <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not collecting cash from customers as efficiently or has loosened its credit policy to generate more sales I also noticed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had a low effective tax rate last quarter only I made up a proforma analysis of what Intels earnings would have been if inventory levels were at initial projections and if the tax rate was at near the historical level Source Intels SEC filing Authors Calculations We see that adjusting for the inventory level but keeping the tax rate at drops EPS basic from to a share Just moving the tax rate up from to the near average results in an EPS of and this is not using adjusted inventory levels From all of the above one can see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not as healthy as initial reports suggest It has been a wild open to but I would remain a seller of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on rallies until it gets the inventory and accounts receivable levels stable relative to sales Ill update with further analysis once the full K is released </div></body></html>
