currency issues will be key items to examine Update on mobile is important for future growth After the bell on Tuesday afternoon well get an important earnings report from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Hopes for another strong year from the company were seemingly destroyed when management issued a Q revenue warning in early March While that means we have a better idea of where things will land on Tuesday there are still a number of key questions to be answered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>blamed its lowered forecast on weaker than expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain Management reduced the midpoint of its revenue forecast by million to billion This has forced analysts to reduce their numbers for multiple periods as seen in the table below Some analysts have not revised their forecasts the high estimate is over billion leaving the analyst average a little above Intels midpoint One of the key items I will listen for is the currency impact As we all know the dollar has been very strong lately Management discussed challenging currency conditions in the warning an issue not really discussed previously Investors also want to know how weak the PC space is because there are a lot of other companies that might be impacted by industry weakness The PC Client Group accounts for a majority of Intels revenues and operating profits There was one bright spot in the warning and that was commentary that the Data Center Group was performing as expected Its nice to see the second most important segment doing well but unfortunately it wont be able to compensate for a struggling PC segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is also expected to provide an update on its mobile situation with this report Im guessing that things are not going well which is why management decided to again change its financial reporting structure By merging the mobile segment into the PC group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can essentially hide its large mobile operating losses which were over billion last year Management originally guided to an million improvement this year but well see if that forecast changes One item that might be overshadowed by the discussion of the PC and mobile businesses is the companys capital return plan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has returned tens of billions to shareholders in recent years but things havent always gone as investors had hoped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>went a few years without a dividend raise and now the buyback is an issue Management went in and bought over billion worth of shares in the second half of at an average price of about Im curious to hear how much was spent on the buyback in Q and what management will do going forward Shares are now a couple of dollars below what the company paid in late so the buyback seems poorly timed at this point With a number of acquisition rumors flying in recent weeks investors might get a bit upset if management continues to overspend on shares when the companys cash could be used for another purpose As you can expect shares have not done well in recent months especially with a big revenue warning In the chart below you will see how shares are near the lower end of their month range below both the day and day moving averages Those that rely on technicals would like to see the stock regain the day line after earnings but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will need to reassure investors for that to happen The stock is yielding more than currently thanks to its dividend but a falling day line could provide resistance Just like two of the past three years hopes were high for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>when the year started but expectations have dropped precipitously That now gives the company something to prove going forward Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Now Has Something To Prove Disclosure The author has no positions
