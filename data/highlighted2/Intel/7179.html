Seeking Alpha Asus has released its new flagship ZenFone Android phone Its cheaper than Xiaomis Mi In spite of its GB of RAM premium build and superior camera technology the ZenFone retails for less than The high AnTuTu benchmark score of the ZenFone confirms Intels older x Atom mobile processors are as good as Qualcomms Snapdragon series This is an update to my previous article discussing the merits of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC winning the right to supply its bit Atom Z inside the ZenFone from ASUSTek OTCASUUY Asus has launched the ZenFone in Taiwan and the most expensive version only retails for NT around The cheapest model of the ZenFone the ZECL which only has GB of RAM and GHz quadcore Atom CPU sells for NT I reiterate my position that Asus is the most prolific vendor of Intelpowered smartphones The success of the ZenFone is a barometer of Intels future sales of smartphonecentric processors Asus sold more than million Intelpowered smartphones in The ZenFone could be another tailwind that could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>catch up with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM ASUSTeks smartphone sales in Taiwan last year was already outperforming that of HTC OTCHTCXF and Samsung OTCSSNLF It will only take a matter of time before Asusbranded Android phones also conquer other parts of Asia In my country the Philippines the Asus ZenFone Lite is very popular due to its low price tag and great performance I myself own an Asus FonePad phablet which cost me just that is far better than my Galaxy S The lower than Xiaomi flagship phones price tag of the ZenFone will definitely help ASUSTek achieve its million sales target for smartphones this year Asus with the help of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might just be the next Xiaomi Since Samsung does not sell sub premium Android phones Xiaomi and Asus will be fighting over this price point Techsavvy people will find the price tag of the new ZenFone as the better deal than Xiaomis Mi which was launched today in India for Rupees Below is the tech specs sheet of the top of the line ZenFone ZEML Android phone Compare it to the tech specs sheet of the Xiaomi Mi The more expensive Qualcommpowered Mi only has GB of RAM a smaller inch screen old Adreno GPU and a bit Snapdragon processor Asus does not use Xiaomis hungermarketing tactic However the obvious hardware superiority of the ZenFone compels me to believe that the Asus phone will be tough rival of the Xiaomi Mi Another strong selling point of the ZenFone is that its the first smartphone to wield GB of RAM Not even Samsungs current and upcoming highend phones comes with GB of RAM Xiaomis latest Mi Note also remains stuck at GB of RAM As a video and photo editor I know the importance of having a lot of RAM when editing or multitasking The ZenFone now has the same amount of RAM of my photoediting Acer laptop Anybody who has used Adobes NASDAQ ADBE Photoshop or Autodesks NASDAQ ADSK AutoCAD software can tell you that adding more RAM modules is the only way to work faster Asuss decision to put in GB inside the ZenFone makes it more desirable than a Xiaomi Mi Multitab web browsing on a mobile phone is faster when theres more RAM Gaming is better when there is more RAM The Android OS has so many background processes running which slows down phones However using softwarebased RAM boosters or background task killer apps is allegedly bad for Android phones Asus therefore made the right decision to just add more RAM The ZenFone is safe from the danger of task killing apps Intels bit quadcore GHz Atom processor also helped the ZenFone post an amazing recordsetting AnTuTu benchmark score Take note that the AnTuTu score was achieved by a ZenFone model that only has GB of RAM The Intelequipped ZenFone managed to outscore all those highend Qualcommpowered Android phones from Samsung Xiaomi and HTC I look forward to an even higher score once a GB RAMequipped ZenFone gets tested The chart above should be prima facie evidence that Intels nanometer x mobile processors are as good as any ARMbased processor from Qualcomm Samsung or MediaTek The new nanometer Atom X or X processors would likely post the same impressive benchmark scores Unfortunately winning the support of more OEMs is not only based on benchmark scores and hardware specs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already has a great ally in ASUSTek I firmly believe that the ZenFone s cheap price tag and industryleading hardware specs will find widespread acceptance in emerging markets However Xiaomi sold million phones last year none of them used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors Taiwanbased Asus is only aiming to sell million Intelpowered smartphones in It would be much better if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also wins the backing of Xiaomi because that Chinese company wants to sell million phones this year Xiaomis brand power is definitely stronger than ASUSTeks Intels ally Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has allegedly already managed to recruit Xiaomi to the Windows platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also needs to persuade Xiaomi to abandon its exclusive dependence on Qualcomm Snapdragons for its higherend phones I know Qualcomm and Microsoft have a strong bond in previous Windows smartphone releases However Intels x architecture has proven itself to be the perfect fit for Windows operating systems since the s If Xiaomi really pushes through with a Windows smartphone andor tablet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will greatly benefit if it puts an Atom X or X inside them Since Samsung is still ignoring Atom smartphone processors Xiaomi is the best candidate to mass market Intelpowered Android phones A little contra revenue to encourage Xiaomi to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors is justified Xiaomi is a very ambitious company that managed to beat Samsung Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY and Huawei in China Xiaomi now the worlds fifthbiggest smartphone vendor could really accelerate adoption of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x mobile chips Intels mobile processors will get sold more often if they are inside Xiaomibranded compared to Asusbranded phones and tablets Furthermore Asus and Xiaomi could also be great clients for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE modems like the XMM and RealSense SnapShot cameras The future is bright for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>It is capable of producing lowpower mobile processors that also deliver industryleading performance benchmark scores One more reason to go long on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is that Microsoft already made an official announcement that Windows will be released to countries by summer of Consequently the weakened PC market could change for the better in the second half of Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these
