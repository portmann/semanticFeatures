(Uncertainty) </span>iOS 9 features split screen multitasking which will be available on iPad Air 2 and any new model iPad Apple rolls out this Fall.Apple's version of split screen is much easier to use than the approach Microsoft developed for Win8, and is certainly competitive with Win10.Split screen multitasking and the even cooler video picture in picture feature of iOS 9 definitely close an important gap that has existed between iOS and Windows tablets.Also, Apple will introduce its next generation systems on chip, usually referred to as the A9 series, that will be even faster than Apple's current 64 bit A8 series.These will be fabricated initially on Samsung's 14 nm FinFET node, and so will have improved power efficiency.I've observed that the A8X in the iPad Air 2 delivered comparable performance on Geek Bench to the Core M in the new MacBook with Retina Display.Of course, benchmarks aren't everything, but I expect the next generation A9 series to do even better.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And the next iPad generation will probably get an enhanced A9X that will also perform better in graphics than the A9 (iPhone version). (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The iPad Pro is almost certain to make its appearance by the Fall. (Uncertainty) </span>The iPad Pro will address pent up demand for a larger (12" class) tablet just as the iPhone 6 addressed pent up demand for a larger screen iPhone.Once the Pro is available, I expect demand to exceed supply through the December quarter.Apple's new tablet products should at least temporarily widen the gap between iPad and Surface unit sales and revenue, but competition is intense.I've previously observed that Microsoft is on the right track in pursuing a converged OS approach for personal computers whether tablet, laptop or desktop.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I still believe this is the right approach. (Uncertainty) </span>iPad will always seem a little light weight and less professional than Windows tablets and convertibles.For that reason, I expect competition between Surface and iPad to be intense.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Surface Pro 3 is a great device, and will probably garner more share in the corporate world than iPad Pro could ever hope to do. (Uncertainty) </span>At least until Apple changes its tune on the issue of convergence.Source: Apple: The Stark Contrast Between iPad And Surface Sales Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
