</span>NASDAQ INTC has always been a critical cog as the engine powering PCs and servers but a sea of change and opportunity is just around the corner <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital in to invest in startups to enable new technological offerings to succeed with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside However more recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has become more aggressive acquiring companies instead of just maintaining a vested financial interest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recently purchased Recon Instruments a sporty smartglasses manufacturer based in Vancouver Canada I recently published a Seeking Alpha article detailing Intels investments and recent acquisitions within the augmented reality space I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sees the potential to sell wearable devices as an opportunity to rapidly scale and leverage its IP and rapidly scale its IoT division <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>missed the smartphone revolution but is still fighting for its life to win new business and currently boasts relationships with several smartphone manufacturers including ZTE Huawei Lenovo and Motorola On the tablet side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to attach itself to m tablets giving it a presence in nearly out of tablets sold in with manufacturers including AARP ASUS Dell HP Fuhu Lenovo and Samsung In its December IoT Insights presentation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>lays out the current wearable market product placement in terms of performance functionality and price Within the wearable device market trackers are at the lowest price point and functionality and headworn devices at the highest price point and functionality Intels acquisition of Recon Instruments positions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the top of the current wearable market food chain within the headworn category and is a perfect position for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to leverage its IP to enhance headworn device performance functionality and eventually sell millions of Intelbranded smartglasses annually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is also in a unique position to sell headworn devices and control a lions share of the processors to other emerging players in the smartglasses marketplace Intels CEO Brian Krzanich recently made some changes at the top with key personnel as well as consolidating and streamlining Intels strategy One area that was impacted by the recent change was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital was the blue chips financing arm that was launched in and that has funded more than B into over companies in countries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced last week as part of the recent shakeup that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital will merge with the Mergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Transaction Group The line between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporates role over the past several years has become blurred Several companies that were initially funded by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital ended up being acquired by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporate At the end of the day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to present acquisition targets up to the MA organization for final approval but this former process appears inefficient due to the organizational structure It makes a lot of sense to merge these organizations and focus on the portfolio of investments and decide up front within one committee whether to invest and divest or invest and acquire a company prior to funding each new investment Additionally what the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital organizational shift means to me is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is very focused on growing and developing IoT hardware and software solutions As a result I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to continue to scoop up companies that enhance their existing footprint Recent acquisitions of Altera and wearable devices maker Recon Instruments are prime examples of Intels focus on IoT If you look at the structure of Intels IoT efforts you begin to see synergy across the ecosystem and begin to fully understand Intels most recent acquisitions of Recon and Altera At the foot level IoT begins with wearable and connected devices that collect data and transmit data via WiFi or other means to a central database that is housed on virtual servers cloud or traditional servers The data is collected securedencrypted catalogued and then analyzed through queries The collected data ends up being stored and also acts as the foundation for various servicing options including software as a service SaaS and professional services consulting etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is building a presence within the wearable and connected devices front or the data collectors by acting as an enabler of new technological offerings or in some cases as the manufacturer Intels acquisition of McAfee will become an integral part of Intels soup to nuts IoT product offerings after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced on July st that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security organization formerly the independent McAfee division was formally integrated under Intels security general manager Chris Young There is a strong appetite for the latest wearable and other connected devices by Fortune but in addition to delivering tremendous benefits they also present IT shops with tremendous security risks and concerns Data breaches have been occurring all over the world and it only takes one unsecured access point for hackers to inflict incredible damage to companys brands and financial well being Security is one of the most important elements that inhibit or accelerate wearable and connected device adoption Without question <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is on the forefront of being a leader enabler and producer of wearable devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a unique position to not only be the leading processor supplier to smartglasses manufacturers that will carry a healthy ASP and gross margins but also be a key manufacturer of smartglasses Additionally as IoT continues to develop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in prime position to finally begin to bear fruit from its acquisition of McAfee in over the coming years A new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is on the cusp of developing a new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that will not only be the engine that powers wearable devices but the car that takes
