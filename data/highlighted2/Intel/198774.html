and recently it tested its SDP server development platform With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>having a clearly defined strategy in the space Qualcomms potential here might be limited Even if Qualcomm emerges as a successful player in the space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders have nothing to worry as Qualcomm will take at least a decade to build the entire ecosystem Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM is planning to take a slice of Intels NASDAQ INTC x server chip business via its SDP server development platform SDP which the company has been developing since the past two years was tested in tierone data centers according to the company Industry watchers believe that after the test the company will use customer feedback for product design Qualcomm said The SDP was tested today running the entire software stack Linux kernel version along with KVM virtualization OpenStack DevStack for OpenStack cloud orchestration guest virtual machines running a standard Linux distribution along with Apache web server and WordPress SDP used a preproduction version of core SoC based on ARMs NASDAQ ARMH ARMvA architecture Qualcomm said it will collaborate with Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX and Mellanox Technologies NASDAQ MLNX for its server chip business In this article I will attempt to gauge Qualcomms potential in the server market which is currently dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Lets first delve deeper into Qualcomms opportunities in the growing server market Qualcomms CEO Steve Mollenkopf first mentioned almost a year ago that data center is a more than billion projected market in and the company is finally entering the server market Since the server market advances slowly and deliberately compared to the desktop market Qualcomm will get enough time to prepare itself before ramping up production Few years ago Calxeda ventured into developing lowpower ARMbased dense servers with its existing bit SoCs coupled with fabric technology which would challenge Intels dominance and monopoly in the xbased server market Sadly the company faced financial problems and the company officials had to shut it down in December Although the low performance of ARM CPUs per core compared to Intels Xeon doesnt make it a great fit for the server market yet Calxeda showed that ARMbased servers might have good future potential in this market Intels Xeon continues to dominate the server market with a decent core count coupled with huge performance per core at moderate power levels ARMbased servers can certainly challenge Xeon with exceptionally low power and decent performance per watt ratios This makes Qualcomms decision to enter the server market commercially viable However there are a number of hurdles that Qualcomm needs to overcome before challenging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Intels strategy provides itself the competitive edge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a clearly defined strategy for the server market It knows that big data combined with HPC high performance computing in the cloud is emerging as the new data center trend This trend requires efficient server processors that support massive storage capacity coupled with a lot of computing horsepower Intels strategy is making server chips keeping these issues in mind With its Haswellbased Xeon chips released last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>addressed these issues partially It increased core counts to cores added advanced turbo mechanisms and cache monitoring It also upgraded the entire platform to DDR Intels upcoming Broadwellbased Xeon chips which are expected to be released in the first quarter of will have a number of enhancements for addressing the needs of tomorrows virtualized data center that will thrive on big data combined with HPC in the cloud The enhancements will include page modification logging and posted interrupts for advanced virtualization Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has an established software ecosystem for the data center If Qualcomm cant build a sustainable software ecosystem which needs heavy investments and almost a decades time how could it grab even a fraction of Intels market share Calxeda handed over the baton for ARMbased sever chips to AMD NASDAQ AMD Applied Micro Circuits NASDAQ AMCC and Cavium Networks NASDAQ CAVM Its noteworthy here that AMD the pioneer of the x architecture is returning to the xbased server chip market with its new architecture called Zen However none of these companies have been able to pose a serious longterm threat to Intels server chip business ARMbased chips dont yet have the number of DIMM slots that Xeons memory controller can support If Qualcomm cant make chips with massive amount of DIMM slots competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont be an easy task Add to that the enhanced features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offers will be offering with its Xeon family as stated above I believe Qualcomm and other existing players in the field will face tremendous challenge from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the coming years Earlier this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>launched Broadwellbased Xeon SoCs which the company markets under the Xeon D brand name Its the first SoC design based on Xeon that came up with excellent performance per watt ratios for addressing the needs of the low end server market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had two Atombased server SoCs for primarily competing with ARMbased low power SoCs which werent enough for the low end server market The new Xeon D family coupled with the existing Atom C family will make life difficult for the companies that make ARMbased server chips Can Qualcomm win at least a decent percentage of Intels server market share say Of course but it will take at least a decade which is irrelevant from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders point of view Imagine where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could reach with its Xeon and Atom platforms in the next years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making its workloadoptimized processors and developing its customized chip business at lightning speed I believe Qualcomm needs to acquire either Cavium or Applied Micro immediately which isnt impossible with its huge cash reserve for their fabric and networking assets Otherwise the companys big plan for the server market may be too late We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We
