both companies become entrenched in the IoT the smartphone will undergo a paradigm shift in functionality and become a crucial device for connectivity to smart technology Samsung late to the table in the EVHEV market has followed archrival Apple by investing in a Chinese ecofriendly automobile manufacturer Samsungs OTCSSNLF acquisition in midJune of Joyent a cloud infrastructure and big data analytics company offering a solution that powers realtime web and mobile applications marks its entry into the IoT market Samsungs efforts in the IoT will position the company to move away from being a smartphonecentric company as it faces continued pressure from Chinese smartphone manufacturers of course Apple OTCAPPL has the same pressure Apples HomeKit platform had already been announced at WWDC and the first HomeKitenabled products were released one year later HomeKit is Apples home automation platform for controlling smart home products with iOS apps and Siri voice commands Samsung got off to a late start and announced in midJune that it will spend billion over years for USbased IoT RD and investments This will be led by the Samsung Strategy and Innovation Center Global Innovation Center and Samsung Research America Today Samsung and Apple compete headtohead in smartphone technology features and sales Both companies battle to introduce newer and better features than their previous model and those of their competitor Todays smartphones are used primarily for communicating entertaining or acquiring information In the next several years as both companies become entrenched in the IoT the smartphone will undergo a paradigm shift and will become in addition to its current functionality a crucial device for connecting to Smart Homes Smart Cities and Smart Technology I had discussed Smart Technology in a Seeking Alpha article Semiconductor MA Activity For Smart TechnologyIoT What It Means And The Impact On Supply Chain It is the connectivity that will become the next battleground between Samsung and Apple as illustrated in the graphic below The IoT is moving forward with great potential for revenue generation Samsung spent billion for RD in Apple spent billion a record amount moving the company into the top of worlds research spenders As depicted in the chart below Apple is now on track to spend more than billion on RD in up nearly from and up from a little over billion per year just four years ago Apple is gearing to spend considerable amounts of RD in the near term This tremendous growth can only be interpreted as a plan that I term the Big Apple the electric car Rumors have been spawned for quite some time but stated RD spend by Apple clearly demonstrates that it will be a reality Again Samsung got off to a late start in the EV market To catch up or perhaps even overtake Apple Samsung Electronics announced in midJuly that it will spend million for a stake in Chinas BYD Co one of the worlds largest EV and HEV manufacturers in the world and the largest in China Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB led by Warren Buffett holds a stake in BYD BYD sold electric and plugin hybrid vehicles in almost tripling sales from the previous year It currently controls about of Chinas ecofriendly car market BYD hopes to double sales this year which would require large quantities of parts Thats where Samsung steps in to make chips for EVs and HEVs and at the same time strengthen operations for semiconductors Apple has been rumored to be working on a selfdriving electric car codenamed Project Titan I like Big Apple better Tesla NASDAQ TSLA General Motors NYSE GM Toyota NYSE TM Nissan Volkswagen FiatChrysler BMW and just about every other auto company including Zoox Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Uber Private UBER are among the manufacturers that have been involved in developing selfdriving cars to one extent or another The market is projected to reach of global sales in The selfdriving microcontroller and processor market is forecast to grow to million by Samsung announced in December it was working on selfdriving car technology Clearly BYD will be a major beneficiary of Samsungs efforts But Samsung will not stop at BYD and instead focus on the entire selfdriving car market competing against Bosch Freescale Semiconductor NYSE FSL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA NXP Semiconductors NASDAQ NXPI and STMicroelectronics NYSE STM Samsung has been supplying parts to Apple going back to the Apple A system on a chip SoC designed by Apple Inc and manufactured by Samsung Combining an ARM CortexA CPU with a PowerVR GPU the chip commercially debuted with the release of Apples iPad tablet followed shortly by the iPhone smartphone the th generation iPod Touch and the nd generation Apple TV For the iPhone there are reports that TSMC NYSE TSM may be the sole manufacturer of processor TSMC has manufactured the A chipset used in the iPhone and Plus but had shared the manufacturing of A chipsets with Samsung When Apples selfdriving car is ready for prime time it could very well be that Samsung again will supply semiconductor components to Apple Disclosure Iwe
