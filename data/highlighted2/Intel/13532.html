Large Technology Stocks Down Over Seeking Alpha Some market watchers have been disappointed that the SP Index has not declined The SP Index might not have suffered a decline but many of the components have The SP Index NYSEARCA SPY has moved steadily higher with minor shallow corrections This has frustrated some traders and analysts wanting to see a correction What these traders and analysts have missed is the rolling nature of the correction Classic stock pickers might have benefited from the correction or increase in individual issues The index following crowd no so much Three large technology stocks included in a number of indexes were selected to highlight stocks that have fallen by or greater during the past year There are many other stocks that have experienced sharp price declines The issues are Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC as shown in the chart below The SP has experienced mild setbacks by comparison When considering a stock investment the bonds are generally reviewed at the Finra website Bond investors tend to worry about the payment of interest and principal The following bonds differ but provide sufficent information to consider the common stock IBM due The issue is rated AA by Standard and Poors The recent price was for a yield Microsoft due The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poors The recent price was for a yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>due The issue is rated A by Standard and Poors The recent price was for a yield Apple NASDAQ AAPL was recently added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average so for comparison purpose one of its bonds is considered Apple The issue is rated AA by Standard and Poors The recent price was for a yield Return on assets have been under pressure The dividend yield for IBM Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are shown in the chart below The dividend yield have been increasing and is narrowing the gap with the bond yield In addition the dividend yield is greater than the dividend yield of the SP Index as can be seen in the chart above The trailing net income has been more mixed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has seen a steady increase in trailing new income Microsoft has seen stable to slightly lower net income IBMs net income has dropped sharply The decline in IBMs net income was greeted with a sharp decline in the stock price The dividend yield continues to lag that of Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The SP Index offers an dividend income yield roughly equal to the year US Treasury yield Income seeking investors have a dilemma Invest in US Treasuries an earn a relatively low interest income or consider individual bond issues for higher interest income Invest in an index like the SP Or invest in individual stock issues with a higher dividend yield and the potential for increased income Longterm look at dividends paid since There is principal risk with both the bond and the stock approach should the investment need to be sold However the ability of the investment to generate a higher level of income favors an investment in stocks Longterm look at priceearnings ratio The recent selloff in Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and IBM might be a correction in a bull market or the beginning of a bear market However if the firms can maintain and or increase their dividend payment then longer term investors might be rewarded for weathering the volatility of the shares Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have more equity relative to debt compared to IBM Therefore Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might have a greater ability to maintain and or increase their dividend payments compared with IBM Might the addition of Apple to the Dow Jones Industrial Average have pressured the stock price of IBM Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>If this is the case then it could be an attractive entry point for income seeking investors Though I would tend to steer clear of IBM and focus on Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with the stronger balance sheet However if the price decline is more company specific then investors may wish to perform further research On a relative price basis Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might provide some value Investors interested in the stocks might consider the sale of out of the money put options to generate income and possibly purchase the shares at lower than current prices Microsoft puts have been sold in an attempt to add to the position And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is being considered Unfortunately IBM doesnt look interesting at this time Source Large Technology Stocks Down Over Disclosure The author is long MSFT
