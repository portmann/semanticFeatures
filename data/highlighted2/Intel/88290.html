These Three Yielding Dividend Stocks To Get A Dividend Check In All Months Seeking Alpha To generate a steady stream of income its possible to invest in individual stocks to earn a dividend check in all months of the year Rather than buy a stock that pays a dividend in each month theres a better solution buy multiple stocks that provide diversification as well as high yields Here are three stocks encompassing a broad range of sectors that pay yields and will provide an investor a dividend check every month One of the best things about dividend investing is that the payouts provide income that youre free to spend anywhere you want These payments can greatly help investors cover lifes inevitable expenses However this is sometimes difficult when buying individual stocks because most dividend stocks pay their dividends quarterly which results in a fairly uneven income stream Fortunately there is a convenient way around this to get a steadier income stream One way would be to make a very large investment in a single stock that pays monthly dividends That would work but buying just one stock exposes the investor to singlestock risk Another way would be to dig deeper into companies dividend payment schedules Its entirely possible to find a small group of dividend stocks that pay their investors every three months but with these stocks you can scatter dividend payments throughout the year That way your portfolio will be more diverse than just buying one stock and also generate a consistent income stream Here are three stocks that offer scattered dividend payments which will allow the investor to receive a dividend check in all months For a company that pays its first quarterly dividend in the first month of the year and every three months thereafter I recommend one of the most wellknown dividend stocks of them all tobacco giant Altria Group NYSE MO which operates the Marlboro brand in the United States as well as a number of smokeless tobacco brands a wine business and a significant stake in alcohol company SABMiller plc Altrias dividend track record is nothing short of legendary The company has increased its shareholder payout times in the past years The stock has performed very well also as Altrias total shareholder return for the five years ending December was which solidly outperformed the SP s return in the same period Altrias stated policy is to distribute of its adjusted earnings and at its recent stock price Altria yields The tobacco business is an extremely lucrative one Capital spending requirements are low and because the product is literally addictive Altria enjoys tremendous pricing power For each of these four months Id suggest investors look at oil and gas midstream operators which commonly make their distributions in these months These companies own and operate oil and natural gas pipelines and storage terminals They collect fees based on transportation volumes and as a result are not very vulnerable to volatile commodity prices Their structure is very similar to toll roads Because of this midstream oil and gas companies are extremely stable and generate consistent cash flow which allows them to distribute the bulk of their cash flow to their investors My favorite of them is Kinder Morgan Inc NYSE KMI Kinder Morgan pays a hefty yield and has also grown its dividend rapidly over the past several years Its most recent pershare dividend was higher than the same dividend last year And management has pledged to pay per share in dividends this year which would represent growth from the per share paid in This dividend is very manageable as Kinder Morgan grew distributable cash flow by last year The main driver of Kinder Morgans significant dividend growth forecast is the consolidation that took place last year The billion rollup of its various entities including Kinder Morgan Energy Partners Kinder Morgan Management and El Paso Pipeline Partners created major synergy opportunities This transaction paved the way for significant dividend growth going forward because the new company enjoys a lower cost of capital For these final four months Id recommend a technology stock to round out a diversified mix of stocks One of the highestyield technology stocks that pays its dividend in these months is chip giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQ INTC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>pays a dividend yield which is quite strong for a technology company The reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can pay such a relatively high yield is because its a huge company in fact one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world and generates a lot of cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>raked in billion of free cash flow last year and paid billion of dividends That represents a modest free cash flow payout ratio which should allow for Intels dividend to grow over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has increased its dividend by compounded annually over the past five years The beauty of dividend investing is getting paid to do nothing Companies that pay dividends reward their shareholders with strong income each and every quarter and the most wellrun companies will actually increase their dividends each year like clockwork Altria Kinder Morgan and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are leaders in their respective industries that each pay high dividend yields and the prospect of dividend growth By investing in these three an investor can form a small blended portfolio across the consumer staples energy and technology sectors An equalweighted investment in these three stocks would provide a yield Even better investors would receive dividend checks in every month of the year in a steady stream of income that can be used to help pay for everyday expenses Source Buy These Three Yielding Dividend Stocks To Get A
