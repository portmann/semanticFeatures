style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have damaged managements credibility On the other hand shares still trade at a reasonable level Investors shouldnt be in a hurry to sell here but should probably assume the company will underperform its own expectations until proven otherwise Having followed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC for quite a long time now including having owned it for multiple years but thankfully selling out near the peak I have to say that Ive lost some patience with the companys trend of persistent overpromise and underdeliver Recent news Q earnings and the accompanying bombshell about laying off of the workforce serves to substantiate that view In Intels defense of course many of the challenges they face such as structurally lower demand and longer replacement cycles for PCs are outside of their control On the other hand their execution on things inside their control mobile data center etc has been patchy The good news from an investment perspective is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still reasonably priced for a large cap it trades at a belowmarket multiple of earnings with a good balance sheet while offering a strong dividend and modest longterm growth prospects as growing segments like data center and Internet of Things will increasingly offset declines in legacy PC chips Im not going to dwell on the continuing declines in PC demand which led <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to decrease guidance for the year because a I think this is a horse that has already been flogged to death and b theres really not much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can do about it aside from taking what little share AMD NASDAQ AMD may have left to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>basically is the PC chip market so as it goes so will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>More concerning from an investors perspective is the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management simply isnt delivering on their promises for growth in nonPC areas which should be under their control Industry overcapacity in NAND has led to their Memory business posting negative operating margins Although some of this is related to startup costs it seems at this point that the this time its different thesis around Micron NASDAQ MU and the broader industry has blown up it will continue to be a feastorfamine boomandbust cycle While Memory is a relatively small part of Intels business its thus hard to judge if the returns on capital here will be worthwhile The Internet of Things division delivered decent results in the quarter up double digits but its coming off an easy comp the division only grew in while the broader Internet of Things market almost certainly grew much faster Progress in mobile chips also continues to be relatively slow While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is rumored to have won the secondsource slot for the iPhone modem this is hardly sufficient payback for the Infineon acquisition years ago or the rest of Intels costly mobile development efforts Finally and perhaps most frustratingly the Data Center Group which is going to be the biggest single driver of operating profit growth can no longer credibly be considered a teens growth business as it has been portrayed After growing only in it grew at around in the first quarter of if you choose to adjust for the extra week While this is hardly cause for alarm in context of the PC market declining faster than expected it does mean that revenue growth will be more challenging for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to come by than it would be if DCG grew at a midtohigh teens clip Beyond the somewhat disappointing financial results the headlines over the past few months significant executive turnover and then the sacking of a tenth of the companys workforce are somewhat confusing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management talked on the call about accelerating our strategic transformation but then what exactly is it that theyve been doing over the past few years Indeed the real challenge has been that Intels growth in nonPC areas just hasnt been fast enough to offset the declines The company as it pointed out on the call has grown revenues since despite the PC market declining but low single digit revenue growth is not going to make shareholders happy nor is it a good performance in light of the opportunity set available Results now are obviously a function of decisions made quarters or years ago the design and manufacturing process takes time The concern isnt so much financial here in fact the restructuring net of assumed reinvestments should lead to a bump in earnings but rather strategic Throwing more money and people at a problem doesnt solve it but Intels results over the last few years suggest that maybe they should be investing more rather than less in emerging technology segments and their nonPC business although being quicker to pull the plug when it becomes clear that an area like mobile chips just isnt going to yield the financial or strategic benefit originally expected For example while Im not as concerned about the length of Intels process lead over competitors as some analysts are its undeniable that the nm has been a big source of headaches leading <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to break their traditional twoyear ticktock cadence I realize that its much easier to be an armchair analyst here than it is to you know shrink wafers and all that But that being said its not immediately clear that the solution to Intels challenges is to use less resources rather than more I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders need to be in a hurry to sell here earnings could actually improve a decent chunk over the next few years thanks to the transformation savings notwithstanding performance in emerging growth areas With shares paying a good dividend and trading at a belowmarket multiple there doesnt really appear to be a big downside case here Still bulls me included have consistently underestimated the rate at which PC demand would decline and I think at this point its time to throw in the towel on
