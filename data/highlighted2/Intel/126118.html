Investor Growth of both mammals like elephants and corporations like Apple are limited by their size Mohnish Pabrai paraphrased and with the reference to Apple inserted If you could own trillion Apple or seven largecap tech stocks worth trillion which would you prefer Consider the potential scale of the investment Millions of us love our Apple products admire the company and see no reason why it cant top a trillion but consider the scale of that size of an investment Mohnish Pabrai makes an eloquent case against investing in companies that become too large He compares companies to mammalsnature seems to have imposed a size limit on mammals and companies alike There have never been mammals much larger than an elephant perhaps because mammals are warmblooded and need energy to survive It gets progressively more difficult for the heart to circulate blood to the extremities as a mammal grows bigger Similarly the top management of a large and growing corporation becomes progressively more removed from the multiplying touch points with customers suppliers and partners This reduces management effectiveness eventually causing scale to become a disadvantage and providing competitors with an opportunity to beat the incumbent Source Mihaljevic John The Manual of Ideas The Proven Framework for Finding the Best Value Investments p Wiley Kindle Edition Mihaljevic advises us to focus attention on the relative scale of the potential investments ie are there any elephants among them rather than the size of our portfolio He illustrates placing elephantsized Toyota NYSE TM at billion on the right side of the table and seven smaller companies on the left He continues Many of us inappropriately consider the scale of our portfolio ahead of the scale of potential investments and will think I can buy a tiny stake in one the above companies He calls that the smallfish mindset or MindSet A In contrast the mindset of a chief capital allocator MindSet B is this Do I really want to spend B to buy Toyota or would I rather after further research buy some or all seven of the companies on the left with my B and have money left over The lesson here is not primarily about diversification it is about the scale of an investment a purchase of a single share of TM is a big investment if thats all you can afford because TM is a big company I had to think about that for a while John Mihaljevics book has influenced my investing such that most stocks I own have market caps less than B Apple is one of the exceptions I decided to take Mihaljevics example of Toyota above and substitute Apple NASDAQ AAPL market capweighting it against seven tech companies between B and B with an aggregate market cap of trillion Cisco NASDAQ CSCO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE TSM Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM SAP SE ADR NYSE SAP Baidu NASDAQ BIDU and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ were selected consecutively from a list of tech companies ranked by market cap and were selected for no other reason than market cap The purpose of this comparison is solely to get into Chief Allocator MindSet B ahead of further due diligence Retained earnings as a simple measure of value creation over the life of a company SA author Early Retiree put me on to this with his October article called IBM Is As Cheap As In April I have adopted this metric that comes right off the balance sheet into my valuations Here are the retained earnings for both sides of the scales the tech companies on the right side of the scale are in descending order of their market caps Retained earnings are earnings left for investors or for reinvesting after any dividends have been paid Retained earnings are not an absolute measure of value remaining in the company but the growth in market cap should eventually align with retained earnings a statement attributed to Warren Buffett Apple offers fewer retained earnings than the seven large caps in aggregate on the right side of the above table Here is a graph showing Apples market cap overlaid with retained earnings through Q of separate scales Except for year the market has added value at a rate proportional to the growth in Apples retained earnings Lets for a moment forget any due diligence we have already done on Apple or the seven companies on the other side of the balance and get into the capital allocator mindset We have trillion to invest Are we going to consider buying Apple for that entire amount the price tag would be enterprise value in that case not market cap but thats beside the point Or are we going to consider allocating that trillion to some or all of the other seven That would get us diversified into companies that are not yet the size of an elephant When I force myself to think that way I think I understand the markets reluctance to allocate a lot more to Apples market cap Remember what John Mihaljevic advises Focus on the scale of the investment not on the scale of your portfolio Thats hard to do I didnt do that when I bought Apple oh I just want a little piece of it Thats my small fish mindset Source Buying Apple Consider The Scale Of The Potential
