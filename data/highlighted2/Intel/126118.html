The purpose of this comparison is solely to get into Chief Allocator Mind-Set B ahead of further due diligence.Retained earnings as a simple measure of value creation over the life of a company.SA author Early Retiree put me on to this with his October 27, 2013, article called "IBM Is As Cheap As In April 2009."I have adopted this metric that comes right off the balance sheet into my valuations.Here are the retained earnings for both sides of the scales - the tech companies on the right side of the scale are in descending order of their market caps: Retained earnings are earnings left for investors or for re-investing after any dividends have been paid.Retained earnings are not an absolute measure of value remaining in the company, but the growth in market cap should eventually align with retained earnings, a statement attributed to Warren Buffett.Apple offers fewer retained earnings than the seven large caps in aggregate on the right side of the above table.Here is a graph showing Apple's market cap overlaid with retained earnings through Q2 of 2015 - separate scales: Except for year 2013, the market has added value at a rate proportional to the growth in Apple's retained earnings.Let's for a moment forget any due diligence we have already done on Apple or the seven companies on the other side of the balance and get into the capital allocator mindset.We have $0.7 trillion to invest.Are we going to consider buying Apple for that entire amount (the price tag would be enterprise value in that case, not market cap, but that's beside the point)?Or are we going to consider allocating that $0.7 trillion to some or all of the other seven?That would get us diversified into companies that are not yet the size of an elephant.When I force myself to think that way, I think I understand the market's reluctance to allocate a lot more to Apple's market cap.Remember what John Mihaljevic advises: Focus on the scale of the investment, not on the scale of your portfolio.That's hard to do - I didn't do that when I bought Apple - "oh, I just want a little piece of it."That's my small fish mindset.Source: Buying Apple: Consider The Scale Of The Potential Investment Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
