Will Mark Something Unique Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD has long trailed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>both on process technology and CPU architecture This made AMDs CPU offerings all but obsolete unable to compete on performance power consumption and truly even in value though they are cheaper will bring an unique development for Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD For once its likely that both AMD and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC will be fielding CPUs on the same process node This event is the result of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>delaying its advancement to the nm process node along with GlobalFoundries having struck an agreement with Samsung to use its nm process technology As AMD has already reported it will launch its Zen core during and this core will be coming with FinFET transistor technology This implies it will use the nm process node GlobalFoundries got from Samsung With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>late to nm this means that at least during it is highly likely that the toptier products from AMD will be competing at the same process node as Intels Thus whatever disadvantage AMD might still have at that point will have to come mostly from architecture I say mostly because apparently Intels nm still carries a bit of advantage over Samsungs However there are news in the architecture front as well AMD has long lagged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in that regard with outdated and rebadged CPUs being particularly famous for their low IPCs Instructions Per Cycle AMD tried compensating for this by adding cores and using higher frequencies but the truth is that AMDs offerings simply havent been competitive for years However the Zen core besides using a process node which will match Intels will also be changing AMDs course on IPC AMD promises a higher IPC for it A cuttingedge process node plus a large improvement in architecture should mean a significant jump in performance and power consumption for AMDs leading edge products While there are no recent IPC benchmarks there are approximations like single core tests Still its hard to know if a IPC improvement will be enough Theres also no data on frequencies or number of cores which AMD will use though AMD also announced it is now going for SMT Simultaneous Multithreading akin to Intels Hyperthreading I think theres a good chance that even with the improvements AMD wont surpass <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>However theres also a good chance that the fight will again become close enough instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>keeping its presently massive lead Close enough might mean AMD will be able to compete on value Which it really cant at present While the story I described above should give AMD a chance during there is still an entire desert to cross during where AMD has little if any competitive product in the market Even in GPUs where the fight with nVidia NASDAQ NVDA used to be close AMD is now also just playing catch up with its Fury Fury X GPUs These GPUs match nVidias best But they dont surpass them even with their innovative HBM stacked indie memory promising much higher bandwidth and much lower power consumption So on the CPU side AMD is done until it introduces the Zen cores and in the GPU side the most it has at this point is a match to nVidia which might still allow it to recover some market share Thankfully AMD has no large and impending debt maturities So at the very least it doesnt look like AMD is in nearterm danger If it fails its attempt however this story will change dramatically to the worse AMD introducing a new CPU architecture during on a process node as advanced as Intels is a significant event It carries with it the chance that AMD might exit however temporarily the funk in which it has been for many years As such that event will merit monitoring That said the short term looks so ugly that between now and then there doesnt seem to be much reason to buy and wait The best hope in the short term is simply that AMDs matching of nVidia with its superior HBM tech might allow for market share respite in the GPU market Anyway looks like it might be an interesting year for AMD I will be sure to pay attention lest AMD pull an upset on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Source AMD Will Mark Something Unique Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
