<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings potential for Quarter is uncertain with many emerging growth areas making slow progress Growth areas that may start to emerge in the Q earnings report include portable PCs desktop PCs cloud computing network virtualization new memory and mobile phones I was planning to work on a more indepth series on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC with other SA authors but my recent businessvacation trip to Germany resulted in a lot of catching up in various parts of my life With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Earnings Announcement coming up quickly on Tuesday October I will briefly review in this article my thoughts related to where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may be heading click to enlarge Below I will comment on each of the six emerging growth areas that I see for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Please share your thoughts in comments Its clear from recent sales reports that portable PC sales are strong and growing These include ins and clam shells The new processors announced in September will further fuel this growth The growth in this area is likely muted due to delays in getting the new PCs to store shelves Lots of great announcements but strong positive user experience after the processors are on shelves is needed to really grow this segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>selling into the supply chain early may show up in Q sales Primary sales still seem to be fifth generation processors preSkylake Strong growth in Q followed by even stronger growth in Q is likely This is a billion sales area for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>As such its a scary area for sales On the bad side if desktop sales continue to fall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has billion in revenue to loose On the other hand frequent upgrades of desktop units for workstations and gamers are essential for productivity and enjoyment These groups upgrade their systems about every two years and the impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>PC sales should not be underestimated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>admits they skipped an upgrade cycle for highend desktop processor units and paid the price this year This skip has a possible silver lining if the workstation and gamer buyers now jump in to buy desktop PCs with th generation processors I will be listening for hints of such a boost in Q earnings The cloud portion of Intels Data Center has been a shinning star in earnings over the last year The emerging growth portion of this market will be cloud computing with an emphasis on big data analytics The cloud model has focused on a place to collect data from many sources Ever larger amounts of big data are now available for analysis in a way that can benefit many areas including health business and transportation Big data analytics in the cloud will grow rapidly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with others in an open environment has developed cloudbased computing to make computers much more efficient at processing large amounts of data and has increased utilization of data centers from to over utilization This increase in efficiency and utilization has not slowed the demand for data center growth but has fueled this growth by making the processing of big data quicker and reducing the costs Cloud computing sales are notoriously lumpy from quarter to quarter Q was strong Q not so strong Q could go either way This emerging market has a billion per year potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In the past singlepurpose custom expensive ASICs have dominated the telephone industry computers Over the last five plus years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made large investments and huge progress in working with the industry to develop open software needed to allow lower cost general purpose processors to do the work of the expensive single purpose Telcon ASIC equipment Essentially network virtualization replaces all of the network switches and special purpose equipment with software that virtually creates a network General purpose processors can now do the work previously done by ASIC switches and other singlepurpose processors This emerging growth area is still small with huge potential Intels purchase of Altera is key to better meeting the needs of the telecom industry FPGAs integrated into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors faster at meeting the specialized needs of the telecom industry at a price that will make moving from single purpose ASICs to general purpose processors with FPGAs a nobrainer I will be listening for hints about progress in this area although big announcements are not likely to come until the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Day in November Much has been written on SA about Intels new D XPoint memory and cost disruptive D NAND Micron NASDAQ MU and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have jointly developed the new D XPoint class of memory and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to be better positioned to benefit from the advancement by combining the memory with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors This is especially true with regard to use of the new memory in DIMMs where the speed and lower cost will be a huge step forward in quickly processing Big Data for beneficial uses SSD demand will grow quickly with both D NAND and D XPoint These products have not yet reached the market so the impact will not likely be seen in Q results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made much progress in the area of developing the IP Intellectual Property needed to gain market share in mobile phones The latest Zenfone is a great example of this progress This emerging growth area for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely increase dramatically when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>develops SOCs based on the Core M that accelerates the use of a mobile phone as a PC in conjunction with Windows Continuum In Q we will likely see a further reduction in losses associated with mobile phonestablets as SOFIA numbers increase The big gains in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mobile will come in I would not be surprised to have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announce at the November Investor Day that in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will sell into over m mobile phones with no contra revenue He who lives by crystal ball eats glass This next week we will likely be dinning on very murky and unclear glass The emerging and lumpy nature of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>growth areas makes anticipation of quarterly earnings results difficult if not impossible The longterm picture is bright with the various growth areas and I will be looking for hints at progress in these areas during the Q announcements and conference call on Tuesday The rosy picture special glasses required is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will beat anticipated earnings and set the stage for a stock price breakout above after the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Day announcements in November Earnings below market anticipation Tuesday will make a breakout following Investor Day much more difficult The safer investment approach is to watch carefully on Tuesday for positive results above market anticipation then watch for a stock price increase at the end of Wednesday and opening higher Thursday morning If an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>price rise sticks on Thursday morning a break out in OctoberNovember above is likely We only use your contact details to reply to
