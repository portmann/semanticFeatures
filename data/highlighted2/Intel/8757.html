NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels predicted earnings miss caused the price to fall about Microns stock fell in sympathy with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I have been a sharp critic of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC here and here and somewhat of Micron NASDAQ MU here Some people think they both have great promise for breakthrough technology especially in D NAND Some think they are part of oligopolies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>PC desktop and servers Micron memory and therefore deserve a premium PE ratio And some think they are being held back because people do not really understand them and more explanation of their potential is needed In this article I will explain why I think Mr Market is right on the money so to speak From the bluff head where I watchd today I saw her in the doldrums for the wind Was light and baffling Lord Byron <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron are two of the favorite stocks on SA Since March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has had articles written about it and Micron seven And oftentimes a given article on one of the stocks will mention the other one Of course since they have a JV joint venture to build NAND that should probably be expected If we look at their stock prices over the last months you can see they usually follow one another in the same direction although being more volatile MU tends to have more amplitude for a given price movement But the big kicker is the third line on the chart the Dow Jones US Semiconductor Index which for the first time in over a year is higher than both INTC and MU Some might consider that a buy signal Just today RBC downgraded MU to from a day after Deutsche Bank said FQ estimates are probably coming down The current Nasdaq earnings estimate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is brutal with downgrades and only upgrade Micron is not nearly as bad but still there appears to be little enthusiasm in the market for MU Good news always seem to be down the road a bit In Intels January CC alone there are mentions of nd half or back half by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich BK and CFO Stacy Smith SS Heres a sampling LTE version would be in the first half of next year We are growing below the market in terms of bits Wouldnt expect to have tools running in the new space until more like So INTC and MU are saying to Mr Market first half is kind of sluggish but the second half and beyond are gangbusters and Mr Market is saying I think I will wait and see Thats really all there is to the lack of upward pricing in these two stocks Various other reasons stock prices are down for INTC and MU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to limit contrarevenue going forward and this seems problematic at best Samsungs OTCSSNLF competition in DRAM and D NAND is worrisome to investors Are ARM processors a threat to Intels server and desktop dominance Can Micron be underperforming in NAND right now but overperform in the future Ivan Donaldson We have been underperforming overall in the NAND segments off late So at these depressed prices why doesnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>just buy Micron I think most Micron shareholders would jump at the chance to get a quick a share in exchange for some cash and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock And would only be about x MU earnings The combined billion company would be a monster with about billion in capex and could provide most of the content for any given device And with their size they would be the new bully on the block and could kick sand in the face of Samsung or anyone else who might challenge them And if they moved the headquarters to Boise then management of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might quit and we would solve that problem too When it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron Mr Market is now from Missouri and needs to be shown rather than told how good things are going to be So it will be slow going for their stock price until one or the other or both actually show some of the production and especially profits that they have been talking about for the last year or so I would not be in a hurry to buy either stock right now Why not wait until the second or better yet the third quarter conference calls to see if the future they predict now actually comes to pass You might lose a bit of upside but predictability and clarity would allow plenty of upside with little risk Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>And Micron Stock Prices Are In
