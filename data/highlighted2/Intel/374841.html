Award lists two American companies KLATencor and Lam Research Applied Materials the largest semiconductor equipment vendor is not on this years list Intels increased capex should improve market share for KLATencor Lam Research and ASM International in A strong dollar in negatively impacted semiconductor equipment market shares of foreign companies but a stable exchange rate for will moderate this effect On March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQ INTC announced it recognized companies with its Preferred Quality Supplier PQS award which celebrates exceptional performance and continuous pursuit of excellence here The recipients exhibited extraordinary achievements across key focus areas of quality cost availability technology customer service labor and ethics systems and environmental sustainability Ive been analyzing the semiconductor equipment and material space since and I monitor these announcements yearly as they are critical in projecting the outcome of a particular company from several standpoints <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has one of the largest capex budgets yearly and is the largest semiconductor manufacturer So when equipment is purchased its in large volumes to meet company capacity expansion needs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is one of the leading companies with respect to technical innovation so when the company makes technology purchases as opposed to capacity purchases for a new node or new device the equipment needs to perform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has one of the most stringent qualification programs in the industry to qualify a piece of equipment or material in order to maintain its leadership as described in Suppliers that meet these requirements for Intels award have developed a tool based on quality cost availability technology to enable them to meet requirements of other semiconductor manufacturers and hence generate more income and market share This award serves as a sanity check against supplier claims of increasing market share because these cannot be substantiated and talk is cheap There are more than processing steps to make an integrated circuit and Intels Award covers suppliers across the spectrum of equipment and materials to meet its needs I want to focus this article on processing equipment as opposed to test packaging or materials for several reasons The only two American companies in its most recent awards are KLATencor NASDAQ KLAC and Lam Research NASDAQ LRCX There is the striking omission of Applied Materials NASDAQ AMAT which was last years Supplier Award This Supplier Award serves to reinforce an October article I wrote in Seeking Alpha entitled Making Sense of the Lam Research KLATencor Merger here I noted in this article and a previous one referencing Lams acquisition of Novellus that LRCX was making moves to boost its competitiveness in the D device space Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the D space and clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made a purchase of KLAC and LRCX equipment finding the quality so high that it gave the award to the two companies In the article I detailed market share for the process control sector inspection metrology based on a report by The Information Network I noted AMAT could have readily gained the upper hand in D against LRCX with its own acquisition of KLAC but this is where egos get in the way I pointed out in previous Seeking Alpha articles that AMATs CEO Gary Dickerson was passed over for the top spot at KLAC when he worked there and then left to lead VSEA which was acquired by AMAT a few years ago The result AMAT would never in a million years merge with KLAC this is a merger remember not a hostile takeover with Dickerson at the helm If we look at the deposition etch listing from Intels Award List there are three companies ASM International NASDAQ ASMI LRCX and Hitachi HighTechnologies I wrote in an August article entitled Winners and Losers in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Micron D XPoint here that the winners would be LRCX and ASMI and AMAT would be a loser I stated Key processes for D NAND are dielectric and tungsten deposition and dielectric etch Analysis by The Information Network indicates that LRCX has more than a share in dielectric etch compared to AMATs In metal deposition LRCX holds a commanding share compared to for AMAT So the real winner between the two companies in this sector is LRCX The Information Network estimates that LRCX can generate billion in revenue from D NAND over the next few years LRCX is on the current list and AMAT is not I pointed out in Intels D devices that I suspect that atomic layer deposition ALD will be used due to the unique properties of this technique ASMI is the dominant player in the ALD market I also stated Another clue is that AMAT recently announced an ALD tool I think the company was waiting for the AMATTEL merger because TEL is one of the leaders in ALD Without TEL I suspect AMAT wants to have a tool available for upcoming generations of XPoint Besides TEL another dominant player in ALD is ASM International There is another player on Intels list Hitachi HighTechnologies According to a press release by the company here Hitachi HighTechnologies has been on Intels list for the past years This is unprecedented and the only company on the list continuously for that period of time Hitachi HighTechnologies competes in the etch and process control space I noted in an article in Seeking Alpha on December entitled Large Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturers Losing Market Share To Smaller Companies here that Hitachi HighTech continues to impress In the plasma etch sector of the semiconductor equipment market the report estimates that the company will increase its share over competitors exhibiting a growth of in over compared to growth for Lam Research and for Applied Materials My analysis begs the question whats happening to AMAT A February article in Investor Business Daily quotes several analysts perspectives on AMATs recent quarterly conference call entitled Applied Materials Loots Lam Share But KLA Customer Heist Foiled here Applied Materials looks to have orders up substantially in the current quarter It begs the question of whether there was some shift from Lam to Applied Materials in the current quarter As I mentioned in item above this award serves as a sanity check against suppliers claims of increasing market share because these cannot be substantiated and talk is cheap In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cut back on its capex spending An October article in Electronics Weekly here noted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has cut its capex forecast again the fourth time this year and it now stands at bn plus or minus half a billion down from the bn figure of late last year We cannot be sure about AMATs orders because they are a moving target and the semiconductor industry continues to have pushouts and pullins on equipment purchases based on market conditions and visibility Perhaps AMAT benefited from increased orders from TSMC NYSE TSM With LRCX on Intels Supplier List and not AMAT the statement in the February issue of IBD may be shortsided Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg says the math supports a market share gain by Applied Materials Wafer fab equipment WFE spending fell in vs Applied Materials yearoveryear growth in silicon systems He models silicon sales growth over vs a yearoveryear increase in industrywide WFE sales Applied Materials however says equipment demand will be flat in vs However I pointed out in several articles in Seeking Alpha that the strong US dollar negatively impacts revenues and market shares of foreign companies because market share is always converted to dollars This concept is clearly presented in the April article entitled The Semiconductor Equipment Market Really Didnt Decrease Percent In Did It here was a repeat of with respect to a strong dollar The dollar appreciated against the Yen and Euro to the tune of and respectively Thus Japanese competitors to AMAT in the etch sector Hitachi HighTechnologies and Tokyo Electron decreased in dollar revenues by while the European competitor to AMAT in the deposition sector ASMI decreased in revenues by in the conversion to market share Thus Weston Twiggs analysis that the math supports a market share gain by Applied Materials needs further analysis My perspective based on the above is that ASMI KLAC and LRCX will gain market share in based on capex spending increases and these companies exposure to INTC AMAT may have gained market share in but it is an illusion based upon dollar conversion for the sake of compiling market share Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
