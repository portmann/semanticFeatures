execution Domestic cash buffer around billion is key for debt raises In January technology giant Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported a tremendous blowout quarter leading many investors to expect a large buyback raise Management has stated it will provide an update on its plans at the April earnings report The buyback program has been the more influential part of Apples capital return plan in recent years with more than twice as much cash used for the buyback than the dividend Today Ill discuss why I think the best idea for Apple is a smaller more flexible buyback which may disappoint investors looking for a huge headline increase to the program Apple initially announced a billion buyback in raised it to billion in and further increased the plan to billion last year According to the latest Q filing Apple had utilized billion of that amount as of December th In the chart below you can see how the buyback has impacted Apples splitadjusted number of shares outstanding These are end of fiscal quarter values so the Q point below refers to the December ending period From the peak during fiscal Apple has reduced its outstanding share count by about three quarters of a billion shares which is nearly In addition to helping the stock the buyback has significantly improved Apples EPS figures In the companys fiscal period Apple reported earnings per share of and that figure was boosted by nearly cents thanks to the buyback In the most recent quarter where Apple had over billion in net income the buyback improved EPS by cents over the prior year period The latest turning point in shares was when Apple stepped in and bought billion in shares after the January earnings report Apple shares were in the low to mid s at that point splitadjusted and have rallied continuously since Management believed in the companys nearterm future and put a lot money behind that faith Apple generates tens of billions in free cash flow per year although a lot of that is outside the US The company also has added a lot of debt to facilitate its repurchase program In the table below you can see some key balance sheet metrics at the end of fiscal Q basically the calendar year in recent years Dollar values are in millions In early February the company added another billion in debt Since a majority of its cash is located outside the US Apple is taking on debt rather than repatriate funds and having a huge tax bill With interest rates this low that makes sense At some point however the company may be forced to repatriate funds and investors are hoping that Congress can come up with a deal to lower the tax Like most tech companies Apple doesnt plan to repatriate at the moment especially not with tax rates this high Im very curious to see what Apple does over the next couple of years as some of its shortterm debt comes due especially if interest rates finally do rise The first parts of Apples debt start coming due in with further issues due three years after Apples total debt amount has surpassed its US cash domestic balance as seen in the chart below With Apple taking out that billion earlier this year probably to be used mostly for the buyback we will likely see total debt rise above billion at the end of fiscal Q For those looking for a tremendous buyback raise this would mostly require additional debt If Apple doesnt plan on repatriation anytime soon I dont think the company wants to get its debtdomestic balance ratio up too high There are some differing opinions on what Apple will do with its buyback at the April earnings report Back in January a Credit Suisse analyst called for a billion capital return plan by the end of of which billion would be through buybacks On the other hand a UBS analyst discussed the issue of repatration Apple may wait for more clarity on the tax issue resulting in a smaller buyback over a shorter time period If the company believes a tax holiday is coming it may be more generous with its share repurchase plans Theres one other item to keep in mind and thats stock price The following table is from Apples Q showing open market purchases over the past five quarters Apple spent billion in fiscal Q both and However in this years period the stock price was much higher so Apple did not get as much bang for its buck That situation has stretched even further in fiscal Q because Apples daily closing price in this quarter has been about The companys buyback in the past looks good based on where shares are currently but that makes it harder to get the share count down going forward With the stock currently trading at it is nice to see the purchases above are at significantly lower share prices Apples two completed accelerated repurchase programs bought back billion worth of stock at about and respectively The buyback has been extremely successful since the share price is much higher Last week I discussed how chip giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC decided to rush in and buy a tremendous amount of its stock in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares have fallen since thanks to a weak PC market Intels buyback looks foolish when a large chunk of shares were bought at prices higher than current levels Apples management has done the exact opposite buying when shares were well below current prices Apple had about billion left on the billion plan at the end of December At the current billion per quarter rate the company would finish that plan during calendar Combined with the past announcements each April and talk from management we are expecting an update next month That leaves Apple with three possibilities for the April announcement in my opinion The first option is along the lines of the UBS analyst and something Ive been favoring in recent months In this situation Apple basically goes yeartoyear with the buyback like it has done in the past couple of years If Apple does this I would expect the company to maybe raise the buyback to say billion telling investors it will revisit the situation a year from now April This would leave Apple about billion for share repurchases over a five quarter period which puts the name around a billion per quarter run rate The second option is along the lines of the Credit Suisse analyst Here Apple would announce a significant increase to its buyback and detail a timeframe for it say to years The amount of the buyback would depend on how willing Apple is to take on debt and perhaps if the company believes it will start repatriating funds In this situation Apple could raise the buyback to billion or maybe even billion depending on the timeframe The third option is comparable to what some other technology giants have done and a common practice among stock buybacks Apple could simply raise the buyback to a given amount but not give a timeframe simply repurchasing shares over time as it sees fit In this scenario the buyback is a little more flexible If Apple decides to go with this route then the total value could be almost anything While I dont hold Apple shares currently my personal preference as someone who follows the name extensively would be options one or three I believe that flexibility is the best plan here and those two options give the company the most wiggle room A lot can change in the technology space and the market in a year Also I know that most of the headlines that will come out will cite the buyback total but remember that timing is key A billion plan over two years is more important in the shortterm than a billion plan over five years On Monday I read another article on this site predicting that Apple would increase its buyback by billion to billion at the earnings report next month The contributor did lay out some of the key points that Ive referenced especially regarding timing but I think the article needs a little further analysis First the article discusses the possibility of billion in cash available for the capital return program As part of this Apples calendar starting cash balance of roughly billion in the US is given a figure I discussed above However I believe this cash should be excluded because I believe the company wants to hold a buffer of cash a margin of safety If we go back to last April Apple had a little over billion in US cash at the end of fiscal Q Shortly thereafter Apple took out another billion in debt Thus I believe the billion should be discounted because when the US cash balance gets down around that number more debt is added That happened earlier this year as well Additionally let me point out that the contributors billion to billion increase would be an acceleration of what Apple did last year an increase of billion Since that time the stock has risen substantially and the company has taken out almost billion in additional debt Overall I think that the authors buyback amount increase could be accurate but given my thoughts and the above items I think the timing may be a little off This goes back to the flexibility discussion I presented above If Apple raises its buyback by billion I think thats a twoyear plan Apple is expected to update its capital return plan next month and most investors are looking for a buyback raise Apples share repurchase plan has been quite successful in supporting shares and improving EPS in recent years While most of the companys cash is located outside the US interest rates are low so Apple has been quite comfortable taking on debt In my opinion the company should try to be as flexible with its buyback program as possible That might disappoint some investors if the announced headline number isnt tremendous However I think it sets things up better for the long run In the end Apple will most likely continue its buyback program at a brisk pace and thats a good reason to remain long the stock Source Apple Whats A Proper Buyback Disclosure The author has no positions in any
