Although Intels competitive advantage lies in its ability to scale downwards aggressively at new nodes investors fear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may fail to maintain its process lead It may appear that TSMCs subnm roadmap could make Intels future beyond nm uncertain but the reality is quite different With the industry fast heading towards subnm nodes process size is losing relevance The objective definition of process nodes is different to different foundry operators such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>TSMC GlobalFoundries and Samsung OTCSSNLF The days are gone when a process node was defined by halfpitch and transistor gate lengths Today a particular process node refers to a collection of features such as die size power consumption frequency scaling etc When an IC a microprocessor in this case is fabricated in the process node these features determine how powerful and technologically advanced the microprocessor will be Beyond nm the size of a process node assumes greater importance if the underlying microprocessor technology is EUV extreme ultraviolet lithography For example Intels original intention was using the latest semiconductor technology EUV for nm In the company hinted that embracing EUV might not be possible for even subnm nodes in the near future Intels Mark Bohr said We would like to have EUV for nm but I cant really count on that So we are also exploring the option of a nonEUV version of nm It looks doable At this very early stage we can achieve better density and lower cost But if I had EUV I could do a much better job So we are still looking at and exploring EUV for nm but we are not absolutely counting on it for nm What is EUV and why its so important Well EUV is the next generation technology of making chips which uses extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of just nanometers Todays nonEUV technology uses deep ultraviolet light with a wavelength of nanometers Dutch company ASML Holding NASDAQ ASML is the leading EUV toolmaker of the world The companys EUV systems use LPP laserproduced plasma technology for making chips based on EUV However the technology is still evolving and hasnt yet been ready for volume production of chips In July last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>first publicly signaled that Moores Law is slowing as a result of the challenges the semiconductor industry is facing Its a challenging job to scale down the chip production process toward nm With EUV not ready yet current nonEUV technology is the only option despite its limitations However ASML believes the EUV technology remains the key to getting Moores Law back on track reported opticsorg Why the nonEUV technology is not suitable for smaller nodes Well printing finer features for smaller nodes is extremely difficult using the larger wavelength of the laser emitted from a nonEUV tool This will result in shrinking profit margins for chipmakers Indeed once EUV becomes ready to use it will help chipmakers return to the earlier situation when Moores Law was working EUVs shorter wavelength of just nanometers will do the trick And this holds true for TSMC also TSMC coCEO Mark Liu said Weve made significant progress with EUV to prepare for its insertion likely in nm This in essence means that although TSMC is planning to begin its nm chip production this year it wont use EUV for nm and even nm Between and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will launch three nm chips which are Cannonlake Icelake and Tigerlake In TSMCs nm chips will arrive in the marketplace However without the benefits and advantages of EUV TSMCs subnm chips wont challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm chips ASML is the only company in the world that has achieved some early success in making EUV tools Although ASMLs rival Japanbased Gigaphoton is way behind it the company is also making good progress in this area Gigaphoton founded in has the potential to become the second EUV vendor after ASML For chipmakers this is certainly encouraging because going forward they dont have to depend on ASML as the only provider of the technology As ASML claimed EUV can bring Moores Law back on track If that happens I believe beating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont be easy not only for TSMC but for Samsung and GlobalFoundries as well given Intels billion RD funding and equity investment agreements with ASML Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
