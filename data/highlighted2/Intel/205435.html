Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains a solid play on semiconductor The company proved resilient in the PCCG group and was able to reduce the negative impact from shipments due to the mix shift to higherend components I readjust my estimates to account for Altera and believe that the inclusion of those earnings will result in high singledigit EPS growth for the current year Data center lumpiness is typical during Q and longterm the segment has legs for significant growth For the most part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC had an allaround pretty decent earnings report Now I know many of you would probably disagree with this and thats fine But the change in guidance pertaining to the server segment was temporary for Q as the seasonal impact on data centerrelated spending does tend to slow down in Q However the company does anticipate that the performance of the DCG will be resurgent going into the next year The company reported revenue of billion and EPS of I guess the big surprise was the PC Client Group as the company beat on sales expectation the ASP mix improved due to gaming systems which is hard to verify in thirdparty channel checks However it speaks to the overall strength of certain parts of the PC segment which bodes well for Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA earnings Nvidias earnings have yet to be announced as highend CPU units are complements to GPUs Since gamers are running on new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture which switched over to newer PCI Express lanes the video card needs to be replaced too So theres going to be some strong replacement demand On October IDC came out with a report that stated Worldwide PC shipments totaled nearly million units in the third quarter of Q according to the International Data Corporation IDC Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker This volume represented a yearonyear decline of slightly worse than projections for a decline of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reports that unit volumes fell by yearoveryear However the pricing improved by yearoveryear which is what closed the revenue gap Im sure the other PC OEMs will report a substantial decline in PC shipments as a result of declining PC demand But theres enough evidence to suggest that further upstream weakness in demand could in fact impact PC OEMs Highend core series CPU units are moving significant volume to offset a decline in shipments which indicates that highend PC OEMs like Apple NASDAQ AAPL and enthusiast PC users were pretty busy in the past quarter Credit Suisse NYSE CS offers some insight into the PC channel in one of its recent reports Current ODM data suggests that CH builds could be at the weakest level ever at down yy vs consumption down yy however implied hh growth for builds in CH is up mostly in line with seasonal of hh Additionally we would highlight that ODM units typically experience sequential growth approx bps above seasonal during the quarter of and the quarter following a major MSFT software update respectively They anticipate that further upstream inventory build seems highly probable The analysts at Credit Suisse anticipate halfoverhalf growth and an incremental to basis point impact from Windows refresh which adds to in terms of sequential comps for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some flexibility with its revenue guidance for Q which is reflected in the figure The stock continues to rally higher and I anticipate that upside will be limited to over the next three months Of course there could be exceptions to this assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some surprises in store at its investor day conference in Q I lowered my EPS estimate from to due to slightly worse revenue outlook and a slower pace of share repurchases However my EPS estimate is higher than the consensus because I included the impact from Altera into my revenue and earnings model In prior quarterly earnings conference calls Brian Krzanich mentioned that the impact from Altera could be included in Q so I took the liberty to include the impact from the Altera transaction That being the case the stock has some upside from current levels as my current price target is Slightly lower than my previous target but not by too much I anticipate that PC unit recovery will likely occur in Q but becomes much more pronounced throughout The client PC market bottoming out is highly dependent on whether the PC ecosystem is able to deliver on new technologies that leverage the platformspecific advantages of Windows Of course there are a lot of what ifs here but for the most part inventory buildup will likely resume in Q in response to stronger demand in the period Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recognizes the revenue on PC OEM buildup so if Intels Q is strong PC OEMs will experience some strength in Q but are actually increasing inventory in anticipation of a stronger Q when compared to prioryear comps Inventory days for PCs are historically around days so it wouldnt be surprising to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gain a bit of that inventory buildup towards December as older inventory starts to clear out of the retail channel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also mentioned that losses pertaining to mobile had narrowed in the prior quarter Of course the extent to which is hard to measure because the transition away from MCG muddles the ability to make yearoveryear comparisons That being the case management specifically stated that theyre of the way to reducing mobile losses by million which implies that mobile losses have been reduced by million but the annual burn is still around million Cost reductions are Qloaded because the improvement to unit ASPs will follow a refresh in mobile chip SKUs The development of cuttingedge chips building the wafer capacity for the mobile SoCs and the continued efforts to market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside mobile all add up to significant costs The contrarevenue impact subsided a little bit as a result of releasing competitive parts which reduces the need to price mobile components below the bill of materials Furthermore the company is on track to gain some mobile share in the mobile modem and app processor space which I will go over in much more detail in a different article Overall I see some recovery in PC Client Group continued strength in DCG narrowing of losses in mobile and blue skies for storagememory and network virtualization <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains a
