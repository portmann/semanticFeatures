going to give the MacBook Pro some serious competition Apple selected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for its most expensive MacBook Pros Microsoft also selected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips for its first enterpriseworthy premium laptop Intels NASDAQ INTC shares have recently been on the upswing I hope that Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT launch of its firstever enterprisecentric laptop will further fortify investors faith in INTC Microsoft is using th Generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake Core i and Core i for its Surface Book laptoptablet hybrid The price range of the Surface Book makes it a clear threat to the Apple NASDAQ AAPL MacBook Pro The Intelpowered Surface Surface Pro and Surface Pro continue to threaten the sales of ARMbased iPads and the MacBook Air Microsoft now wants to challenge Apple in the lucrative sector that made the MacBook Pro successful Microsofts ambition to become more vertically integrated like Apple with its Mac computers is a tailwind for Intels already profitable desktop processor business Microsoft and the Surface brand exude great quality and enterpriselevel reliability Please take time to watch the YouTube video to appreciate my prediction that the Surface Book will provide stiff competition to the MacBook Pro and other very expensive laptops Aside from its superior build quality the Intelpowered Surface Book is a real innovative product that exposes the outdated design of the MacBook Pro Unlike the k MacBook Pro the cheapest Surface Book has a touchscreen display that is also detachable for tablet mode usability Creative professionals will find this touchscreenstylusfriendly advantage of the Surface Book the killer excuse to abandon their MacBooks Just look at the screenshot below the Surface Book is the ultimate laptop for creative professionals This Intelpowered highpriced laptoptablet can take advantage of the touchscreen optimizations of modern industrystandard software like Photoshop CC and Ableton Live Enterprise clients are not stupid they will appreciate the obvious savings in buying just the Surface Book The MacBook Pro iPad Pro combination will cost them more money to get the same level of productivity that the Surface Pro or Surface Book already offers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the ultimate longterm winner over Microsofts intensified campaign against the iPad and MacBook products of Apple It supplies the processors for both the MacBook and Surface products The future scenario is that Apple will have to eventually retool its MacBook lineup to match the pricing strategy of Microsoft I expect Apple to eventually create Intelpowered iPads to make them relevant against the onslaught of sub Windows Android tablets Apple will also eventually have to buy the latest th Generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors inside its MacBook ProMacBook Air laptops Last Mays release of the MacBook Pro revealed it was still using the old Haswell Core i and Core i processors I do not think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will give discounts on its latest Skylake Core processors like it would on oldergeneration chips More investors will rally behind INTC if it focuses more on highermargin processor sales rather than on discounted mobile Atom processors The highend Surface brand of computers is good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Microsofts ambitious move with the Surface Book makes it a guaranteed volume buyer of the new Skylake processors Nadella will probably not stop with laptops Theres the chance that Microsofts vertical integration will also include a Surface AllinOne desktop computer product that could rival the iMac Intels desktop PC processor business will remain even more monopolylike especially among corporate buyers once Microsoft starts acting like a highmargin PC vendor like Apple Microsofts continuing snub of Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD CPU and GPU products only affirms my longterm bullish outlook for <span style='background-color:
