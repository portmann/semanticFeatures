ARM Triumvirate Of Growth ARM Holdings plc NASDAQARMH Seeking Alpha ARM Holdings reported yy revenue and operating income growth greater than The success of ARM and key partners is part of the ascendancy of the new semiconductor paradigm over the commodity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>model Even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC reported flat revenue for Q ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH has demonstrated impressive growth in revenue and income ARM together with Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE TSM forms a triumvirate of growth in semiconductors The paradigm shift away from commodity processor makers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been underway since Apple introduced the iPad using its own custom System On Chip SOC In the new paradigm processor design IP is the new commodity Mobile device makers such as Apple and Samsung OTCSSNLF use that IP to design custom or at least customized SOCs for their devices Then silicon foundries such as TSM build the SOCs to order In the new paradigm theres no room or need for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The force of the paradigm shift can be seen in the profitability and growth of the ARM triumvirate Apples guidance as of the December quarter earnings report For TSM I converted their results stated in NT to US and I did the same for ARMs results just reported on April Ive chosen the members of the triumvirate based on their success in adopting or adapting to the new paradigm I could have selected other players such as Samsung or Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM but havent for two reasons The first is that each has to some degree resisted the paradigm shift rather than embracing it fully The second is that the members of the triumvirate stand out for their growth while Samsung and Qualcomm have suffered somewhat impaired growth The fortunes of Samsung and Qualcomm might change this quarter for better or worse so Ill be very interested in analyzing the earnings reports of these companies when they come out And of course Ill have my Apple earnings preview on Friday Although Apple is clearly the big dog of the triumvirate ARM continues to wag the dog by virtue of its position as sole source of ARM processor IP This brings in revenue to ARM in the form of licensing fees for any company that wishes to build an ARM processor Some companies such as Apple license only the right to use the ARM Instruction Set Architecture ISA which is just an agreed upon set of numerical codes that tell the processor what actions to perform Apple then designs its own silicon implementations of the ARM ISA Whether a company licenses only the ISA or an actual design implementation from ARM ARM also receives a royalty for every processor produced While total technology licensing has slowed down to yy growth total technology royalties have grown by yy This in turn is fueled by processor shipments which stood at billion in Q a yy growth ARMs leadership position has been cemented by its introduction of the bit family of processor designs based on a bit enabled ISA called ARM v The importance of bit processing in mobile devices can be seen in Apples success with the latest generations iPhone s and which used Apples custom implementation of ARM v The entire mobile device industry has moved to catch up with Apple and this has led to a new generation of bit processors from Samsung Qualcomm and others One of the interesting points that ARM made at its Q earnings conference call is how rapidly bit ARM processors are being introduced In Q only about of all ARM processors about million were bit By the end of the year ARM expects about half of all smartphones to use bit ARM processors ARM v has also enabled a number of server products from EZChip Annapurna and Cavium The offerings from these companies will not upend Intels dominance of servers but may make inroads this year One analyst asked an interesting question about how ARM v processors compare with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core M I had made the observation subsequently verified by testing a review unit that the Core M in Apples new Retina Display MacBook only performed about as well or a little better than Apples Ax in the iPad Air in Geekbench Some have been inclined to quibble about specific test results and whether Core M might be better than the Ax using other benchmarks Im sure one can find a specific Core M processor and a specific benchmark where the Core M scores better than the Ax This is missing the big picture takeaway that Apple achieved roughly comparable performance to the Core M using an inferior process technology planar nm TSM vs nm FinFET <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>While the ramifications of this may have been lost on some readers it clearly hasnt been lost on ARMs management They pointed out that new Chromebooks are being introduced using a Rockchip bit ARM processor Yes Rockchip is covering its bet on SoFIA that is if they ever produce a SoFIA chip ARM also feels that its next generation bit design dubbed Cortex A will be performance competitive with Core M ARM also pointed out it has started to receive royalties from processors produced on a nm FinFET node which undoubtedly is Samsungs since it was the only one in production in Q This is also an area that will see very rapid adoption in the mobile device industry in the latter half of the year as TSM ramps production of its own nm FinFET process ARM is primarily a research and development organization As such it invests in nearterm technology innovations that will pay off in product royalties in a year time span RD headcount and cost is growing proportionally to revenue growth as they should ARM recently acquired Wicentric and Sunrise Micro Devices specifically to bolster ARM in the Internet of Things IoT Sunrise has hardware radio IP that can be integrated into SOCs This continues the longstanding trend of integrating more and more functionality into the SOC Wireless communication through WiFi Bluetooth or LTE is increasingly being integrated into the SOC itself Eventually I expect standalone wireless modems to be superseded by wireless IP that SOC integrators such as Apple will pick and choose for their devices How companies such as Qualcomm adjust to the new reality where wireless is just a functional block on an SOC belonging to someone else is a good question going forward The ARM triumvirate represents the future of processor manufacturing not just for mobile devices but for most computing devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>represents the past It may be a profitable past but its a past that is rapidly receding like a train station viewed from the train that is pulling away from it The train of the new paradigm has left <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>standing at the station It is symptomatic of companies in decline that they begin to market themselves to investors based on hope for the future rather than current results things will get better next quarter in the second half next year Weve heard all of those statements from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The ARM triumvirate doesnt have to do that Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do
