amwe are long INTC MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Desktop is a billion business at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Half of the desktop revenues are from businesses Half from consumers Desktop sales will grow in gaming enterprise compute stick residential gateways mini PCs allinones and appliance uses Are the growth areas in desktop enough to offset the demand eaten away by more mobile devices such as smartphones phablets tablets ins notebooks laptops <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC provides little breakdown of its desktop sales We know that desktop is a billion business We know that half of the sales are to businesses We know that some desktop market areas are growing and other areas are declining Will the desktop growth areas grow fast enough to overcome the declines in the desktop areas that are not growing This is a similar question that is asked in other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>markets Are the cloud HPC and networking parts of the DCG Data Center Group growing faster than the old school server sales are shrinking Will more mobile PCs eg ins grow fast enough to offset declining sales in desktop More broadly will DCG grow fast enough to offset declines in CCG Client Computing Group Intels Desktop division is now headed by Gregory Bryant VP GM of the Desktop Client Platforms Formerly GB as he says he is often called was head of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Asia unit It appears that he is bringing a new focus to Intels desktop platforms In a QA at CES sponsored by PMorgan GB discussed a number of growth initiatives and strategies within the desktop unit With other CES events and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings little attention has been given to the important topic of Desktop sales The Desktop unit is roughly a b business which puts it a about onethird of the CCG revenues Presumably twothirds of the CCG revenues come from more mobile PCs such as ins laptops and notebooks Included in the Desktop Unit are Gaming PCs VPRO PCs for enterprise Compute Stick mini PCs and Residential Gateways These were the focus of GBs talk and appear to be the growth areas within the Desktop Unit Unfortunately other areas within the Desktop Unit were not described or discussed and no information was provided related to the percentage of sales that are in this set of growth products compared to the products that are in the nongrowth areas This leaves Intels competitors guessing good thing and keeps us in the dark maybe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>desktop revenues can grow like mushrooms A few nuggets were provided regarding growth products MinPCs grew YOY from a small base Allins grew at YOY from a small base Compute Stick had strong growth from a very small base Residential Gateways Broadband <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now the No provider of cable gateways and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now the No provider of DSL gateways As we heard in the earnings call higher ASP Average Selling Price for PCs offset to a large degree the lower volume of sales so that PC revenues declined about while sales declined closer to GB pointed out that there were two main factors driving higher ASP for desktop Integration More and more functions are being integrated into CPU units including strong graphics performance connectivity using a variety of technologies security including multifactor authentications and Thunderbolt Integrating these features into the CPU silicon provides greater value to customers and higher ASPs Segmentation Specific focus on meeting the needs of various desktop segments provides higher value and higher ASPs Examples include higher security for enterprise using VPRO unlocking for gaming CPU memory and fine grain B unlocking expanded the areas that were unlocked for overclocking any geeks our there understand fine grain B We have all heard that there are hundreds of millions of PCs in the world that are more than fiveyears old We have all wondered what if anything will drive people to replace these older PCs I think we can all agree that there are still PC uses that cannot be replaced by smartphones most involve getting work done Smartphones are great for communications and now phablets are great for surfing the web However when we need to open multiple windows to develop and assemble a document like writing this article a PC is a must Im using a PC that is more than fiveyearsold to write this Why replace it But the bigger drivers for me will be associated with fully using the new features of Windows including Cortona This is the biggest reason I want to be able to talk to my PC and have it understand and put into text what I say Now I dictate into my phone and transfer to my PC Edge More effective and efficient use of the web including note taking on web pages use of Cortona while surfingresearch I use Adobe for some of this now Hello Verbal and multifactor authentication to start up and run Photo management Looking forward to having photo management built into Windows instead of as an addon Continuum This is mostly a future feature that will enable my phone laptop and PC access the same appsprogramsdatasetup I do some of this now with Google Chrome A common thread here is integration <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft are both integrating features that previously required multiple pieces of hardware and software into one deviceplatform Integration is now king when it comes to meeting consumer demands for ease of use for all of our computing and communication needs VPROSkylake Surprise Features GB said he was not allowed to reveal the surprise features that will be introduced soon with VPRO on Skylake VPRO is a growing segmentation aimed specifically at the PC needs of enterprise Im expecting multifactor authentication more voice commands and features including Hello and Cortona enhanced media support including K secure and EASY connections to conference room large screens features to bring in and access IoT information securely and easily I would like to be surprised <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is seeing clear signs that enterprise is starting the process to evaluate upgrading to Windows and Skylake much sooner than in previous refresh cycles I gather from this that enterprise uptake of Skylake to date has been pretty small This could mean stronger sales coming to PCs in the near future or it could mean that the new features are not yet enough to drive a widespread refresh My guess would be a little of each and that the refresh in enterprise will be gradual It will start with the companies that rely heavily on fast and powerful PCs for productivity and market growth Then refresh will expand in other enterprise areas Enterprise refresh to Skylake is a multiyear slow process Residential Gateways This is an area that surprised me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>kind of snuck into this area through acquisitions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now the No cable gateway processor provider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now No in DSL gateways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>plans to integrate more features into these processors and grow the residential gateway business significantly Integration includes I see residential gateways as the way to tie together and enhance all IT in the home All electronic devices will communicate and be made more secure through the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gateway The gateway will be key to bringing the effectiveness of G into the home by having multiplatform access to the world wide web of information and services PC Gaming Do not underestimate the impact that gaming will have on PC sales million people buy games at least once a month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has seen YOY growth in PC gaming sales Gamers refresh their PCs in half the time of nongamers ESports is expanding the popularity of PC gaming was the crossover year where more money was spent on PC gaming than on nonPCbased gaming Desktop Refresh Skipped a Year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now recognizes that skipping a year in Desktop refresh was a bad move <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generally skipped a refresh cycle of Desktops in that Skylake was the first nm CPU generally available in Desktops With gamers wanting to refresh more often the skipped year hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales and momentum in the gamer desktop arena <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now committed to annual upgrades of Desktop CPUs for gaming New Node Shrinks A recent SA article concluded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont be able to dominate the PC and Server segments anymore just because of its node advantage I add that in recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has NOT dominated the PC and Server segments JUST because of its node advantage Sure the node advantage is important but what is done with the node is more important and this whatisdonewiththenode will grow in importance as node shrinks continue Whatisdonewiththenode has three main areas PC performance mobile performance and server performance The first part of whatisdonewiththenode is the area of priority and timing Up to a few years ago Intels priority was to develop the best performing PC CPU with the newest node In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>flipped this around and its first priority was more mobile CPUs lower heat production <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>even skipped a year and did not produce much in the way of new gaming SKUs in Also keep in mind that while the Data Center is extremely important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>their whatisdonewiththenode for high powered data center CPUs are about years behind the first whatisdonewiththenode mobile priority in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has shown it has the ability to move whatisdonewiththenode priorities around to be competitive in each segment Personally Id like to see this whatisdonewiththenode priority increased across the board in all three segments Another area for whatisdonewiththenode is integration I keep coming back to integration This is huge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>After all half of their name comes from Integration INTegrated ELectronics This integration of new features into the latest node will become even more important than the node development For example in mobile integrating communication graphics flexibility FPGA memory and CPU is critical to compete in the segment first in a package and then at the silicon level In data center we are seeing memory communication flexibility parallel prepossessing being integrated first into packages and then at the silicon level FPGA D XPoint fabric silicon photonics DCG New Data Center products will be announced and delivered soon including a nm Xeon E a nm Xeon D and the nm Xeon Phi These products should start to show up in DCG revenues in Q with larger impacts in Q and Q DCG sales will continue to be lumpy with a huge influence by the world economy I do see new nm SKUs as a driver of DG sales in the second half of FPGAs and D XPoint and other IP integration will increase DCG sales significantly in Network Virtualization will continue to be a growth area for DCG Mobile phones will continue to take a back seat to DCG IoT and memory as a growth area <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is waiting for the right time to make a push in mobile phones Mobile IP continues to be developed As this IP is developed it is used in various form factors including limited sales of mobile phones Zenfone is a good example of where new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mobile IP will be used as is the use of Wifi and LTE in notebooks and gateways This limited and low volume mobile phone activity will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to cost effectively grow mobile IP as well as be prepared for a renewed push into super smartphones Super smartphones will make use of Windows Continuum to have a mobile phone form factor provide all of the computing power needed to connect to and run multiple large screens keyboards gateways etc Super smartphones will be a convergence point for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and an opportunity to rapidly increase sales I put this convergence in late or early In memory I dont expect to see significant revenue growth from D NAND and D XPoint until late or The top competitor in PCs and DCG processors is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>competes against itself to stay dominant and provide customers with great value This competing against itself in these areas effectively deals with any outside competitors PC and DC processors make up maybe or of Intels business AMD NASDAQ AMD IBM NYSE IBM Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and others are encouraged by processor buyers to compete against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>so these buyers can try to get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to lower prices In the PC and DC space they are making little progress against the rapid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>development of higher value products Going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to compete in other areas to make up for PC sales declines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will grow in DC IoT memory and hopefully eventually mobile phones as they become super smartphones I already touched on DC Looking at IoT memory and mobile phones there are lots of competitors I think the biggest competitors are the fabs including Samsung TSMC and GF in that order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to stay ahead of these fabs in node development ie nm and nm not as the only approach to growth but as an important part of an overall growth strategy One of the biggest problems that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>faces is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sells to customers that make products and then these customers sell their products in competition with products made by the likes of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Samsung For example in the PC area the PC is competing against other form factors such as smartphones and phablets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>customers need to make compelling PCs that compete with smartphones and phablets for attention shine and sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has little control over how compelling the final PC is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>teamed up with Microsoft to create the Surface to show other PC makers what was needed After several years the in is finally catching on and making significant growth Even Apple which initially pooh poohed the in is now selling the IPad Pro which essentially is a in Products made with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors need to be competitive against products made with ARM licenses So ARM is likely the biggest competitor for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Ill be looking for an opportunity to get back in as an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will do well over the long term but the ride will be lumpy as it has been for the last two years Investment timing can bring some big returns to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors Buy low and sell high will continue to present great opportunities associated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock as it swings from high to low and back again A great example was the ride from to from late August to late October <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a situation where its performance is largely dictated by the world economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in all of the worlds economies and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales are impacted by all of the worlds economies The economies of scale that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>operates within have clearly indicated that when the world economy does well volume increases and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>profits increase even more The same is true in reverse When the economy is not doing well like now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>volume decreases and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>profits decrease even more Sure there are some exceptions to this but even these exceptions are dramatically impacted by the world economy Many times the world economy can dampen or reverse the economic benefits associated with Intels technological advances The second half of every year is likely stronger than the first half This is a function of holiday season releases holiday sales and timing of Intels Investor day Without a significant improvement to the world economy in the first half of a year or a significant downturn in the second half the second half of each year will be stronger than the first half The second half of looks like it will be the strongest second half over the next three years given the lead time associated with multiple new technologies including D XPoint FPGAs IoT and super smartphones Tagged Investing Ideas Technology
