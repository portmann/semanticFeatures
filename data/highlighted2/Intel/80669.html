INTC starting to come down if only by a little <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has to move away from capitalintensive fab business Another alternative title to this article could be Was the Altra NASDAQ ALTR acquisition the catalyst to reduce Intels NASDAQ INTC capital intensity and follow the Texas Instruments example The Seeking Alpha editors like a catchy title for readers but it is hard to flush out in a pithy or catchy sentence the concept of how Texas Instruments could be the model or example for Intels capex reduction Although Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN had a rough Q with an inventory build that resulted in lower guidance for Q and for the full year the integrated circuit semiconductor company has done a great job since the halcyon days of the semis in the late s both reducing capex and generating consistent earnings and cashflow growth In a brief interview with TXNs investor relations department after I had written the majority of this article TXN stopped building CMOS internally see article here in the early s and then exited the wireless biz with the CMOS business as I understood it subbed out to the foundries TXN now uses analog factories which can be used years versus the higher tech fabs which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>employs that need to be quickly replaced within years For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>it has been a different story as I wrote here in the last few months INTC has had a tough time navigating the secular growth era of the s and early s as their fortunes are still tied to the PC although that is diminishing as their incredible competitive advantage has become a bit of an albatross <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still spending billion a year on fab construction Here is a quick comparison of Texans capex history as a percentage of cashflow compared to Intels capex history as a percentage of cashflow Capex and cashflow figures are calendar year dollars If readers are wondering if this is financial analysis navelgazing the end product of this analysis is that freecashflow which is the available excess capital that can be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases is a function of a companys capital intensity and thus capex requirements Here is the next table readers might find interesting in terms of freecashflow generation and the return of capital to shareholders for both companies Capital returned is the combination of dividends and share repurchases returned to the shareholder how much capital is being returned via dividends and share repos versus freecashflow generated Source balance sheet data internal spreadsheet as stated on earnings reports and Qs PPE is estimated market value of property plant and equipment PPE as of yearend balance sheet So what is the point of all this TXN has cut their balance sheet in half over the last years while INTC has doubled the size of theirs which explains the substantial capex burden INTC bears relative to TXN and thus helps explain TXNs substantial return of capital While INTC paid a lot for ALTR ALTRs fabless architecture is the key to the deal in my opinion INTC invested in a less capitalintensive business as evidenced by ALTRs capex being less roughly of ALTRs cashflow from operations the last years While ALTRs cashflow is still just a small portion of INTCs enormous cashflow and freecashflow INTC now has a less capital intensive segment to utilize That being said ALTRs freecashflow in was just of Intels freecashflow Was paying billion worth it for ALTR To be frank there is much about the electrical engineering of semiconductors I do not understand PLDs programmable logic devices FPGAs field programmable gate arrays are all Greek to me Just show me the numbers and the growth or lack thereof Summary Conclusion my own opinion is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to reduce its capital intensity over time particularly when their so called moat or sustainable competitive advantage is their fab prowess in a secular low growth segment like microprocessors for PCs The ALTR acquisition seems geared to help grow the Data Center segment which is now of Intels revenue but of Intels total operating income I thought it would happen by now but I was hoping that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would be able to gradually reduce its capex requirement over time Maybe the ALTR acquisition is the genesis of that change Trading at x cashflow and at a x pe for expected EPS growth over the next three years of INTC has been a frustrating position Having written about this capex issue with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a few times here and here I recently applied the same concept to WalMart and Home Depot here The relationship to capex and cashflow is indicative of a companys and sectors capital intensity and the ability to transform or reduce that capital intensity over time as Texas Instruments did and Home Depot did quite successfully can reap huge rewards for shareholders Technically a trade below the low of for INTC wouldnt be good Here is one final table for readers For the year period from q through q Texas Instruments generated billion in cashflow from just billion in capex while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generated billion in cashflow on roughly billion in capex even though both companies averaged midsingledigit revenue growth for the year period Source closing price adjusted for splits etc per Yahoo Finance Or maybe the better headline for this article should have been avoid all capital intensive businesses at all costs particularly when revenue growth is hard to come by Ive always been a believer that an incredible sustainable competitive advantage in one era can be an incredible weakness when Schumpeters creative destruction hits ie Josef Schumpeter the Austrian economist that first coined the term creative destruction as it did the major tech giants in the early s Source Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Follow
