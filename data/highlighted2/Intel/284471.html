class='textDiv'>Looking Through The DJIA Rubble After A Day Slide Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long AAPLBACSCODISINTCNKEPGV MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I applied an Volatility Resilience Filter to the DJIA after the August th correction to determine a starting point for research for my investment club The markets historical slide to begin and a passing suggestion by a CNBC analyst that the August th lows may be retested propelled another application of the filter Three components withstood the filtering criteria Two would represent reinvestment for the club The third possibility could be undergoing massive change Its just days before my investment clubs first meeting of was the first time in years we didnt beat the market Paradoxically confirming the anxiety over needing to make up some hypothetical ground the market has recorded its worst start to a year in its history In the clubs history weve measured our performance based on total return Accommodating the volatility projected for the coming year a shift toward dividend growth investing was going to be a proposed focus in the nearterm And then a passing media comment on CNBC grabbed my attention It advised investors to be prepared should the market revisit the August th lows It prompted a quick review of my previous filtering of the DJIA Originally I filtered the DJIA to ascertain the stocks that seemed to best withstand the volatility of the August th correction Identifying the most attractive of the thirty established a starting point for analysis Four months later as the year ended I revisited the six to observe the effectiveness of attempting to determine volatility resistance The August filter initially returned four stocks in which the club already maintained investments Proctor Gamble NYSE PG Boeing NYSE BA Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Therefore the next six companies from the filtering process were used as the for a focus The table below identifies those companies and buy points for each Comments from astute Seeking Alpha readers on the first article predicted reapplying the filter at different points in time would always produce a different set of results And indeed that was true The December review repeated three of the four components the club already owns Apple Cisco and Boeing Adjusting for these three produced an updated six which are listed in the next table again with buy points To incorporate the CNBC analysts comment from January th into this filter of the DJIA requires a comparison of current closing prices compared to the days low on August th The table below highlights the remaining decline necessary in each stock to retest the August th low As shown four components of the DJIA are already tracking below their respective August th lows American Express Caterpillar IBM and Goldman Sachs The CNBC analyst recommendation seemed to imply it made more sense to be ready to jump on those stocks closest to the low Apple M United Technologies WalMart Cisco and Disney are within of the mark From another angle one could assert the stocks furthest from the low are displaying the healthiest resilience to volatility and are worthy of investment Seven stocks Nike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>EI DuPont Microsoft McDonalds Home Depot and General Electric are all more than from their August th lows The original filter can now be applied to the thirteen stocks identified The next table contains the pertinent data including day moving average week high and dividend yield Requiring a stocks day moving average to have to move or less to its week high eliminates United Technologies and WalMart Eliminating stocks within of their week high knocks Microsoft McDonalds Home Depot and General Electric out of consideration The criteria for a stock to bounce from its low to within at least of its day moving average benches Apple M and Disney Necessitating a dividend yield greater than half the average for the index eliminates Nike At this point only Cisco <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and DuPont remain The club does already have investments in the first two Another dilemma for the club is a portfolio that is slightly overweight in the Technology sector Yet if adjustments are applied to the clubs focus to value a growth in annual dividend income above other factors Cisco and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>do appear to be more worthy of further consideration Dividend growth investing does not purport ignoring valuation fundamentals or a companys stability and performance Therefore that deeper dive mentioned in December into the Dow NYSE DOW and DuPont merger was the task at hand This warning from Alessandro Pasetti is hard to ignore I do not know if the deal will unlock bn of value as Dow suggests it would but it appears evident that the next three years could bring nasty surprises if you are going to hold onto your investment particularly on the regulatory front As well Arnold Frisch reasoned that the FTC does not like the destruction of competition the perks for management were not outlined and I hope you listen carefully because if you do you will have nothing to do with these companies until the smoke clears and you will be happy that you left them to their misery Adam Hartung had similar reasoning including the three breakout companies will lack and severely miss product development RD and marketing the lack of competition will likely result in a loss of innovation and Reuben Gregg Brewer is equally disappointed in the merger plans They Dow and DuPont are just pawns in a financial game Merging two struggling companies usually results in one bigger struggling company Even if this deal doesnt happen it looks like we could be looking at a sad ending for a company DuPont with such an incredible history Michael Boyd was not as wary as others during his analysis of the merger and subsequent threepart split His conclusions however were not as rosy as management projections At the low range of our sumoftheparts we get a valuation of B exactly what we started with given the current enterprise values of both companies Ive found that most management teams tend to overpromise when it comes to synergies and underdeliver when it comes to executing them Should the club still be drawn to the merger albeit apparently akin to a moth to flame this advice to buy Dow rather than DuPont from Fredrik Arnold will be recommended to the club Cisco is under consideration because a potential bounce off its August th low looks appealing The company has lost since yearend If Cisco drops below it propels the dividend yield to over On the other hand Intels decline since yearend is As mentioned it would still have to dive over to reach the August th low which is hopefully unlikely If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>declined another to its dividend yield would then equate to In the end it appears the recommendation will be to jump on any opportunity to reinvest in Cisco below and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>below </div></body></html>
