Exposes Its Lack Of Competitiveness At Computex Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha At Computex AMD announced the launch of Polaris GPUs but didnt provide a firm timetable for Zen CPUs Polaris falls well short of competing Nvidia cards in performance which is reflected in AMDs pricing of the Polarisbased RX graphics card Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD made a number of announcements at Computex about its upcoming CPU and GPU products but the defining moment of the presentation was when Raja Koduri head of Radeon Technology Group revealed the lack of performance of the new Polaris GPUs In the chart below he showed that it will take two Polaris GPUs to get slightly better performance than a single Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA GTX Lacking a highend product that can compete with the best AMD is now embarked on a race to the bottom strategy that will deprive the company of any hope of profitability Koduris chart while self consciously obscuring the performance of the new Radeon RX card based on Polaris revealed the marketing strategy going forward for AMD AMD would now seek to democratize gaming with a card offering the best performance for the price The RX may well offer the best performance for the price Without comprehensive reviews we wont know that for sure until the NDAs are lifted on Jun when the is due on store shelves Based on Koduris chart it appears that rumors that Polaris would offer performance equivalent to the previous generation R X look to be about right Assuming thats the case at the will offer the best performance per dollar available At this point theres probably little question about the value proposition of the card Undercutting its competition on cost is probably the only strategy left to AMD But this leaves AMD just trudging down the same path that it has been on in competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC This is not a path to profitability The main reason it isnt has to do with the Nvidia GTX Although Koduri made the comparison with the topoftheline GTX the less expensive has been prepositioned by Nvidia to take on Polaris at a lower price point As the table below shows the two cards are very similar in basic specs Reviews are already out on the GTX After a brief survey I have found that WCCFtechs review to provide fairly typical results I wont go into the details since this isnt a tech review but in every benchmark the GTX scored better than the R X The was even better than the topofthe line R Fury X in every benchmark except the now famous Ashes of the Singularity for DirectX Assuming that the RX performance comes in somewhere between the X and the Fury X the will still be the better card for most games I think this makes the value proposition of the RX considerably less compelling for gamers even at the price point However I think its reasonable to assume that the RX will sell in large numbers and that AMD may even make good on its intention of gaining GPU market share That market share gain will come at a very high price that AMD can ill afford AMD has lost the top end of the market to the GTX In the September quarter AMDs unit volume of GPUs may increase sequentially but GPU revenue and margin can be expected to decline AMD now finds itself in graphics where it has been so long in processors struggling to be performance competitive and having to sacrifice margin on behalf of maintaining some market share Its a losing strategy The state of Zen shows just how bad things can get once performance leadership has been lost At Computex CEO Lisa Su held up one of the Zen samples and once again we heard that Zen will supply a increase in executed instructions per cycle AMDs Zenbased Summit Ridge will be the first Zen processor and will be aimed at performance desktops with eight cores and threads Basically all AMD has done is replicate the performance improvement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>achieved with multithreading Zen is unlikely to do more than catch up to the current generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake processors We still dont know when Zen will arrive AMD would not confirm a launch date saying only that samples would be more widely available to OEMs in Q In the past AMD has stated that Zen would launch by the end of the year but now the company isnt willing to commit to even that With major foundries such as Samsung OTCSSNLF and TSMC NYSE TSM moving to nm by early next year I consider it highly likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will move up its schedule for nm production ramp to the first half of from the previously announced second half This leaves Zen with almost no window of opportunity before new nm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors arrive For each of the products AMD announced at Computex the company could have provided real benchmarks that would have allowed comparison of its products with its competitors It didnt do so for what is probably the simplest reason It knows its products fall short The only option left to AMD is to low ball its prices Investors have to ask themselves if this can be a winning strategy It hasnt been so far AMD doesnt have the production scale and volume to be profitable with its current gross margin of That margin is very likely to erode further in Q AMD has already guided to a margin decline to for the June quarter For Q I expect it to fall below AMDs stock price has ratcheted up recently confirming my expectation that there are still plenty of investors willing to drink the KoolAid Computex showed that AMD is finally running out of KoolAid I still consider AMD a short opportunity I
