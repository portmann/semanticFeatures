Harder Alternative Managing NAND Capacity In The D Age <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha D NAND is likely to result in extraordinary capacity growth Managing this growth while difficult will be key to the industrys profitability One constant among the elements of as of any erawas the disposition of everyone on all sides not to prepare for the harder alternative not to act upon what they suspected to be true Barbara W Tuchman The Guns of August In our last article we discussed the issue of industry NAND demand growth Hopefully we shed some light on the factors that are important in forecasting rates of growth in a market driven by paradigmatic change Whether or not you found my thesis compelling however we can surely agree that industry supply growth will be just as important a factor in the overall business analysis We will now turn to this topic To briefly review the context of this analysis is the sharply diverging market growth forecasts from Samsung OTCSSNLF Micron NASDAQ MU and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC with only INTC projecting explosive growth specifically a tripling of the TAM B over the next three years Questions arise The first question is the one the industry would love to have to answer If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is right can the industry ramp supply rapidly enough to service the demand The second question is the harder alternative If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is wrong and Samsungs projection of growth is right is the industry inevitably doomed to the Jim Handylike projection of massive oversupply and subsequent profit crash in Is there nothing that could be done by industry participants to prop up prices Central to that question in the absence of demand can the industry reduce overall capacity If so what would the mechanism be for such an action Would they delay D conversion of planar fabs Would it be better to hold inventory Failing either of the above is it feasible for the companies to throttle back or even shutter a fab Before we begin our deep dive in a capacity model lets take a moment to illustrate how important this topic is for the businesses that comprise our NAND oligarchy Lets assume that final bit shipments for the industry were EB exabytes and industry revenues were B for NAND and B for NOR Lets assume a Moores law bit density growth factor of YOY If we do the math on the average price per GB received by the industry across all the various use cases for NAND we would get a GB figure Question What will be the average yearly price decrease factor over the next three years through If you are Ernie Maddock of Micron you have the following answer But if you look at the net cost reduction the aggregate rule of thumb is youd see somewhere around half of the bit output increase conversely applied to pricing So as soon as we sort of get through the initial transitions in the ramp We certainly think that were going to close the gap in a very significant way over the course of the next months or so SA Transcripts Credit Suisse Technology Conference Dec emphasis by author So Ernie likes which is a really sweet deal if your costs are dropping at YOY Lets ignore the gross margin aspects of this for now and run a scenario on industry revenues given the bit increase forecasts of Samsung and Micron against Intels X TAM forecast Heres the avg price per bit calculation at a deflator factor And here are the resulting industry revenue projections Note Samsungs bit increase forecasts barely move the industry revenue needle Microns on the other hand show a nice growth to B in and presumably there would be some pretty good profits to go with that revenue since costs are declining at a greater rate than prices Lets take this one step further however Lets assume a world of oversupply in each of the three years to come What then is your average price per GB estimate Maybe it wont drop much if there is only a small amount of oversupply and the industry is selling the bits in highly valueadded packages such as data center SSDs On the other hand lets say we have an extreme amount of overcapacity What then is your price deflator estimate Think its Well thats bad but you are way too optimistic What if I now tell you that fully onethird of your die cost is in CapEx The price floor at which it could be rational to sell your bits then becomes much higher than doesnt it Heres the nuclear winter scenario at a price deflator of Now the above scenario is obviously overly dramatic assuming as it does that the industry participants would all stay in the market and continue to produce future generations of D NAND through this threeyear period By the end of at the latest one or more of the Oligarchs would be gone Toshiba OTCPKTOSYY and maybe more Western Digital NASDAQ WDC Micron or at the very least throttling down capacity The point that we should all keep in mind however is that once a fab is built the company that built it will run it until the marginal price to be obtained is below the die cost sans DA This is the grim logic that faces the industry participants as they contemplate building new capacity The harder alternative indeed Let us now turn to a model of capacity growth for the industry This article will attempt to shed some light on this multifaceted and often opaque topic Lets start with what we do know about supply in the industry at the very least what we think that we know First off we know that the current capacity of the industry is a little over million wafers per month wpm distributed as follows as of the end of As you can see outside of Samsung no supplier has a significant D capacity currently and even for Samsung in its third generation of VNAND the ratio of D to planar is only Micron has an estimated k wpm of D NAND that was built into the white space of its Fab in Singapore with further additions to its capacity having to await the completion of the FAB X buildout in early calendar Q We also know that the WDToshiba partners have plans to begin commercialization of their D BiCS product aiming to exit this year with D capacity ranging in the area of of their total wafer supply Heres SanDisk CFO Judy Bruner as quoted in Kitguru on August of last year Our expectation is that the industry will likely exit in the range of to per cent of wafer capacity on D NAND said Ms Bruner Our expectation is that we will likely be around the low end of that range We note that since it shares production facilities with Toshiba we will also use that number for Toshiba as well SK Hynixs actual D capacity is opaque at this point but it has announced it will be shipping its layer GB TLC die later this calendar year Clearly the transition to D is still in its early stages Most observers of the market are projecting that D NAND will be a minority of bits until mid My model is more optimistic pessimistic than that It shows the production arc as follows Im going to discuss my assumptions that have driven the outcome shown in the graphic above below but for now bear with me while I offer some reasons for why this is going to happen The central thesis of my argument is that there is an inexorable logic that will drive D deployment by the oligarchs Mirroring the mobilization logic that launched WWI the industry now that Samsung is finally crossing the cost threshold must deploy D or abandon the business Up until now it could take its own sweet time getting the D products to market Those days are over Its now deliver or die its as simple as that While D NAND has been and remains a controversial technology the days of doubting it would really ever work are over D NAND is a proven technology that solves the problem of planar NAND scalability We know that because Samsung has proven it Without D NAND the floating gate planar NAND die is simply unable to continue scaling at a Moores law YOY rate Heres Microns depiction of D NANDs impact on scalability versus planar So D is necessary to continue productivity increases in NAND Any supplier that wants to stay in the NAND business has to match Samsungs D product density ie cost with their own product There is no other alternative that gives them any ability to stay in the business So yes lower cost NAND is vital but whats not so obvious but just as important is that D technology also provides better quality product in several dimensions Heres endurance Cycling capability directly relates to the write endurance of the D die which is at least double the write capacity of a planar nm die This is because the cell geometry of the D NAND cell has been significantly increased probably from nm to nm Heres Microns depiction of this phenomenon And the benefits of D NAND versus planar dont stop there The relaxation of the cell dimensions does other very good things for the NAND user in the areas of power consumption up to less and performance approaching X for writes What has all this got to do with supply Simply this D NAND from any of the suppliers is a better product than planar in every dimension important to a customer Staying with planar is not an option for most use cases and applications Planar NAND is not going away any time soon but it will go away Even if somehow the problem of scalability was solved and a planar die could continue to be cost competitive with a D die the product would not be as good not as fast not as reliable not as power efficient So the genie is out of the bottle and theres no stopping The bulk of the planar NAND wafer capacity will be converted to D NAND as soon as the cost crossover threshold is reached We are by all reports close to that point for Samsung and Micron claims that it will be at that point and rapidly accelerating through it within months SanDisk has also claimed that it will have cost superiority with its L GB BiCS D product when it is ready for volume production in at which point it will be less costly than its industryleading nm planar die Keep in mind that when we talk about Ds superiority we need to understand that largescale deployment of the new technology outside of homegrown SSDs will come only after exhaustive qualification cycles that fully test the new controller driver firmware and memory subsystem capabilities If there is one singular weakness of D NAND it is in the metrology arena As has been often noted the suppliers cant fully measure all the quirks of the new media especially in the middle of the die as layer counts increase Quite simply there are error domains that D controller technology is going to have to deal with that cant be fully predicted upfront You dont know what you dont know This will impact and delay subsystem design and that is all important to fully realizing the advantages that D offers over planar NAND Whatever the possible merits of the IM partners D NAND implementation if any it seems logical that Samsungs experience with its VNAND product through three generations gives it a decided advantage in this area Whatever the difficulties associated with qualifying the new D NAND products they will be overcome D NAND is a technology whose time has finally come To recap its cheaper its higher quality and its now or soon will be ready for prime time Lets now build a model of industry bit growth over the next three years though As we do this we must recognize that we are hip deep in speculative territory regarding several of our assumptions We dont really know how fast and how far the D process can be ramped Jeongdong Choe of TechInsights predicted at last years Flash Memory Summit that ramping D NAND to and layers was problematic slide So skepticism abounds with the single biggest obstacle to scaling being the socalled vanishing string current phenomenon The problem is that as the length of the string increases ie more layers are added it becomes harder to reach the top cells because the cells on the way cause disturbance reducing the overall string current hence the name vanishing string current AnandTech July Two things we do know first Micron thinks D NAND can be ramped for the next decade and retain its overall cost per bit advantage and second that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>projects the process to scale at a Moores law rate ie per year Its important to note here that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has company when it comes to these expansive scalability claims Samsung is on record projecting up to one terabit at up to layers by Since it is currently at layers and GBfor its TLC die one has to question how that is going to happen On the other hand Samsungs pace from its first layer GB TLC product in through this years L GB product is a yearoveryear density increase So here is what a Moores law pace would look like over the last five years of this decade if IM is able maintain it What does this ongoing density increase mean for overall industry capacity Heres where we have to make another set of assumptions because we really dont have definitive vendor data about wafer shrinkage as a function of process change We do know that Micron has characterized the initial move from planar to D as roughly a wafer decrease because of the increased fab floor space required for the new process Ongoing we have slides like the following that show a decrease as D generations advance For the sake of our analysis Im going to assume and for the wafer shrinkage caused by the initial and subsequent process advances for D NAND Lets take the new fab X as an example and assume that had Micron purposed it for planar it would have produced Kwpm Lets further assume that the Micron cadence for process improvement is yearly and the rate of improvement is layers per year through here is what that looks like in tabular form Doing the math with a yield results in a Fab X capacity growth curve like the following Impressive Despite the dramatic decline in wafer output over the process generations bit density increases more than compensate for wafer output decline The result a rate of overall capacity increase approaching year over year We should note that this graph is slightly aggressive in that a Moores law process cadence would result in a slightly less dense die see above Gb vs the projected L TLC Gb die than we have modeled here The conclusion I draw from this analysis is that the industry does not need new fabs unless overall demand exceeds a year Could this analysis be wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is adding about k wpm to the D NAND supply by the end of this year Could it be right Absolutely Let us count the ways First we have no idea if the four different suppliers each with a different process can scale them at a year Other than the track record established by Samsung through three generations we have only the suppliers words to go on Whats more only the IM partners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron have even asserted that such a pace is possible throughout a long time frame Second we really have no idea what will constitute a generation with D NAND Samsung has gone from to to layers Micron slide ware shows milestones of layers but does that necessarily mean anything As we shall see below there are hints that Gen could be more than a layer increase What if its layers If so we are looking at a whole new ballgame from a competitive perspective The other suppliers are even more speculative SanDiskToshiba soon to be WDToshiba have announced a Gen layer device and have not positioned Gen SK Hynixs first product is layers and then will transition to by next year Third once the suppliers get past the initial conversion to D with the Gen process we dont know what the process density cadence will be Samsung has released a new generation every year Will the other suppliers We really dont know Beyond that we dont have good data on how affordable it will be to produce the various generations of D Will CapEx costs overwhelm the density gain We just dont know For example the IM partners may find that it is technically feasible but economically unprofitable to scale their product from to layers Are there different limits for each suppliers design Could be but were guessing Finally we dont know what the end point will be Samsung says it can see a path to layers Micron implies years that the layers count could go much higher Then there is the packaging angle Is it possible that these die can be both scaled and stacked in order to aggregate much larger density Apparently so Jim Handy in his Memory Guy blog quotes a SK Hynix scientist saying that stacking D die on top of each other is feasible giving D NAND a useful life that could be decades long Its important to note that stacking does not provide cost scaling On the other hand the density scaling that could be achieved with this technique is mindboggling Handy goes on to estimate that in Samsungs case of the die could be stacked on top of each other before the stack would be thicker that the original wafer that the die was created from All we can really say at this point is that if we take the IM partners at their word the move to D NAND will result in a torrent of new capacity over the balance of this decade At this point it would be imprudent to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron have a unique advantage over their competitors and that is why I modeled similar bit gains by the industry as a whole Ernie Maddock and the executive teams at Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>beg to differ and well return to this discussion of a possible process advantage for IM but for now lets return to our analysis of the implications of the industrys move to D Remember now that were game planning for the failure of demand to match productivity gains So far we have concluded the following D processes are proven and will work Thank you Samsung There is no reason to expect any supplier to fail at D The D product is a better NAND product in every important dimension Bit density increases could well be in excess of per annum industry wide for at least the balance of this decade and perhaps for well beyond that Planar NAND conversions to D are difficult in the first generation but subsequent to that will deliver cost reductions at a rate of approximately a year Assuming all of the above is true once the process ladder starts to be climbed there is no way to turn back without a supplier leaving themselves exposed to potentially crippling cost disparities with the process leader The arms race has begun and it will be hard to stop This means that Jim Handys projection of a historic glut in NAND capacity leading to massive losses for the suppliers is entirely within the realm of possibility if demand doesnt ramp too well beyond per year I have modeled a minimum wafer buildout scenario and here is how it plays out three years hence at the close of What you see above is basically the bare minimum new capacity and planar conversion build out by the suppliers Note the restraint assumed on Samsungs part in only adding approximately K wpm of D over the course of the three years Heres what it looks like year by year is pretty straightforward Everybody except Samsung is building out new capacity because a conversion this extreme is much simpler to do in a green field fab <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron are further along than the other suppliers but everybody is participating in the move to D Even at growth rate supply does not radically overrun demand in see below Based on that and on the optimism that demand will finally start building in the industry will want to build out the new fabs that were started in This results in the following By the close of we have seen the building of one new D fab per supplier and the beginning of the planar to D conversion Other than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>this outcome marks the minimum that the industry suppliers can do if they decide to commit to D NAND While Intels Dalian gambit does add approximately more D wafers to the minimum expansion scenario we should remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron are jointly eliminating k wpm nm planar NAND capacity over the course of as they convert Lehi to D XPoint SanDiskWD and Toshiba are the real wild cards as they play catch up The main point is however that outside of abandoning D and the NAND business altogether there is no other scenario that is economically feasible Lets now consider what this looks like when we play out the demand scenarios If we further assume that all suppliers have roughly the same D density then heres how this minimum scenario looks against demand forecasts Would it get that bad Yes because there is almost nothing the industry can do to turn off the production spigot once the commitment is made to build the D NAND node By late and definitely in Jim Handys apocalyptic vision is a reality and gross margins on NAND are below water maybe by as much as Wouldnt sales spike as NAND prices fell precipitously in late and Hopefully so enough at any rate to clear inventory and only at a horrendous cost The point to remember though is that the D production logic once the commitment has begun has no economic stopping point short of the eventual conversion of the planar node to D because of the cost and quality advantages of the D product In order to stay competitive highcost planar plants must be converted to much lowercost D NAND The bottom line is simple the industry has to see demand levels far in excess of YOY because of the immense CapEx investments they are making in the productivity gains from D Ive modeled the companies retaining significant planar capacity through but beyond that it would need to be shuttered or converted to D Is it possible that there is a silver lining in this scenario for Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Only if we assume that the IM partners have a significant cost advantage that allows them to make at least a small profit at ruinous pricing levels Could IM have as much as a cost advantage in the late time frame If so it could probably sell at the going rate and still bring a little bit to the bottom line One aspect of this cost advantage would be a presumptive density advantage and this has an additional benefit industry bit production is reduced because of lower contributions from nonIM suppliers Lets model a IM density advantage and see what that means for industry capacity versus demand at the and year growth rates through The first thing you should notice is that overall industry capacity in the years through is significantly less than the parity example above vs EB In this scenario even growth will not overwhelm the industry even though is still a problem At higher sales rates the industry is well under capacity especially as the supplier conservatism in building new capacity in and plays out in reduced wafer outs in The other artifact of industry reserve in and is that a large amount of planar capacity is still in play Playing out this scenario a little further one consequence of Samsung delaying the Xian expansion until next year is that both Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stand to gain big chunks of market share Using the densitycost advantage metric at a sales rate we could see Samsungs industryleading share drop from its current to just south of by with Micron having the largest share of D sales Where does this all lead In my mind the takeaway is that demand is the key and even at the middle scenario of growth there are capacity decisions that once made would overwhelm demand and sink margins especially in If for example Samsung decides to defend its D share and builds more D capacity in and it could totally overwhelm demand growth and throw the industry into oversupply So too could any of the oligarchs Clearly unprecedented restraint would have to be shown by the industry Is there a chance that the IM partners could still do well even in a demand dearth environment because of a product advantage Well yes but there is no way we can have any faith at this point that such an advantage exists let alone is maintainable We simply dont know if IM or any supplier has a bankable product advantage Ive read plenty of commentary about the various suppliers D designs but I have seen nothing conclusive Are we looking at this too narrowly Since SSDs are rapidly overtaking mobile as the largest consumer of NAND maybe a supplier could build competitive advantage in the package ie controllers flash management firmware and NAND together that would add so much value that a premium price could be obtained If so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a good bet to be the beneficiary So sure its possible but one has to wonder how long standing an advantage that this approach would prove to be if necessity dictated that all the suppliers were focused on differentiating their products in this manner If anybody is to claim the overall high ground from a package perspective my money is on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>It truly is the wild card in this hand because of its unique position in the data centerenterprise market If anybody can wring adequate gross margins in this market one would think it could WD the old SanDisk will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>some competition in that space as will Samsung but one would think the strength of Intels packaging IP and system level integration would provide key competitive advantages Samsungs brand and momentum in the client drive market is not to be discounted either The issue there is margins that are unlikely to match those in the enterprise Where does that leave Micron and SK Hynix Frankly I have no idea what SK Hynix is doing in this market Its design is a derivative of Sanshibas BiCS approach and to the extent that BiCS gains traction it could have an attractive alternative for the client market There is a good reason for its similarity of product SK Hynix stole the IP Micron is the swing player in the market To the extent that the IM D design rates well in competition with the other suppliers chips Micron could harvest some relatively profitable business on the merchant side Can it swing gross margins in this business Not unless demand is significantly in excess of supply The wild card is its SSD business and by that I mean the DCEnterprise offerings where to date Micron has fared miserably Given its historically poor performance in the client SSD market and Samsungs dominance there I give it a little chance of winning any profitable business in this segment Once again a strong uptick in demand could certainly help its situation but we can expect Samsung to defend its share fiercely against all comers All that being said we must not forget that any profit in the NAND business is found money for a company that has consistently lost money or barely broke even over the last few years Showing revenue growth and decent operating profits in this area would be huge for a company that desperately needs a return on the massive CapEx investments it is making in D and D XPoint What are the odds it will happen It all depends on overall market growth and over is likely to be very good news for the business as long as it doesnt have a major hiccup with D performance or production Below that level watch out Lets wrap this up I dont like what I see especially for anybody not named <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and maybe Samsung If I had to list my concerns in order they would be as follows Samsungs demand forecast and Xian pull back Ugly Microns growth forecast for NAND Ok but barely enough The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Dalian plant capacity coming on late this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>better be right about market growth Jim Handys the sky is falling forecast for At least one half of the projection seems right the upcoming flood of bits from D Will a paucity of demand make the other half of the prediction true as well Against these concerns I weigh Ernie Maddocks optimism more NAND capacity will be needed and Intels truly crazy market growth forecast of X TAM by Whatever they are smoking Ill have some of that Are you feeling lucky You better be if you are going to be investing in anybody but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the NAND business We all need to be prepared for the harder alternative I wrote this article myself and
