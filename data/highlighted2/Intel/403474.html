Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bears are arguing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has failed in mobile but thats more hype and less fact Intels recent decision to abandon Atom mobile SoCs is a part of accomplishing its longterm objective The objective was winning the IoT and connected devices market originally the communications market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has made a bold decision to scrap the mobile version of its Atom SoCs codenamed SoFIA and Broxton <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bears are suggesting that the company has failed to survive in the smartphone and tablet market after spending billions of dollars I believe Intels decision is nothing more than a change in business strategy And thats good news given that global smartphone market is witnessing zero growth according to IDC If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can afford to change its business strategy even after spending a few billion dollars that makes it a better company for longterm investment with a market cap of more than billion In todays dynamic business environment only deeppocketed companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are investmentworthy for the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seriously jumped on the mobile bandwagon in when it introduced Atom mobile SoCs specifically for powering smartphones running on Alphabetowned Googles NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG Android OS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>officially launched its xbased Atom chips back in for netbooks embedded devices and MIDs mobile Internet devices Atom chips are predominantly based on CISC complex instruction set computer architecture although some elements of RISC reduced instruction set computer are incorporated into the chips The Atom story started way back in when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>took its longterm initiative to build a chip having multiple x cores that consume very low power The company also designed a lowpower core in codenamed Bonnell Intels aim was making the chip highly efficient in terms of performance per watt The initiative finally gave birth to an architecture codenamed Silverthorne which was branded as Atom in A AnandTech article explained how Atom emerged If someone tracks Intels activities prior to it would be clear that the companys original aim was conquering the communications market The smartphone and tablet market which came into existence in with the introduction of Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone actually marks the initial stage of the communications revolution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>knew that without embracing the RISC architecture growing in the communications space would be impossible in the initial stage RISC was far more efficient compared to CISC with its fewer instructions to run the communications devices with low computing horsepower <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>therefore developed the XScale chip line based on ARMs NASDAQ ARMH RISC architecture Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to leave the communications market in when the company sold off its XScale chip line to Marvell NASDAQ MRVL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>knew that its not necessary to win every battle to win a war The company might have lost the mobile battle temporarily but certainly not the communications war The question then arises why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wanted to develop an xbased CISC processor like Atom in I have been tracking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since and therefore I am well aware of the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was ahead of its time when it started developing Atom At that time only a few industry experts knew how the communications industry would shape up Click here to learn how an industry expert correctly predicted in that Internetconnected devices the term IoT wasnt coined then will eventually rule the communications industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>knew very well that the Internetconnected devices of the future would need significantly high computing horsepower compared to the mobile communication devices developed in the initial phase of the communications revolution such as smartphones and tablets The company also knew that eventually the power of CISC would be required to support the high computing horsepower of the devices Thats why it took a longterm initiative back in to develop something like Atom When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich said in the Q earnings release We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected computing devices he actually echoed Intels longterm goal to win the communications market And I am confident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is fully prepared this time to achieve the goal To strengthen the transition process <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced a restructuring initiative Atom started gaining traction in the smartphone and tablet market in the second half of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sold millions of Atom SoCs in the last few years and several smartphone OEMs released handsets powered by Atom Atom adoption was on the rise in the smartphone and tablet market despite the fact that ARMbased chips that are based on RISC architecture were more suitable for smartphones and tablets than Atom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provided Atom SoCs to smartphone OEMs at subsidized prices for gaining market share Inspired by the initial success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>planned to diversify the Atom family with SoFIA and Broxton It launched SoFIA last year and Broxton was due this year Why would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>suddenly abandon the Atom SoCs for mobile devices when the going was good I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made the decision since smartphone shipments witnessed zero growth in Q At the end of April IDC released its worldwide quarterly mobile phone tracker which revealed that in the first quarter of this year vendors shipped million smartphones worldwide compared to million units in first quarter of representing zero YoY growth IDC observed this was happened due to strong smartphone saturation in developed markets Why would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>allocate resources to a market thats on the verge of registering negative growth Instead doesnt it make sense to allocate the resources for a market thats rapidly growing ie the IoT and connected devices market Intels Opportunities In IoT And Connected Devices Are Huge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remained unsuccessful in the first round of the communications game because it couldnt displace ARM after selling off its own ARMbased XScale chip line in just one year before the first iPhone arrived Despite that the company continued to spend billions of dollars to develop Atom Why Well Atom is the name of the game in IoT and connected devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already built a strong ecosystem around Atom for next generation devices such as Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT HoloLens which runs on Atom Atom is already an established name in the connected car market which is poised for huge growth in the coming years In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will use Atom in telecom by introducing G compatible modems and SoCs based on the upcoming Atom architecture codenamed Goldmont The advantages of the CISC architecture will be required to run many of the connected devices such as HoloLens because they will have significant amount of computing horsepower The coming years will see the rise of CISC via Atom making Intels longterm plan commercially viable According to a Pocketnow article All these devices that enable our mobile lifestyles require chipsets of their own many times a RISC chipset isnt the right choice for one of these embedded solutions In my opinion thats where Intels Atom processor family fits in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is wellpositioned for the IoT and connected devices market Although Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM could pose some challenges for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>theyre not going to be significant because Qualcomms strategy is different <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has built a robust IoT ecosystem which will act as one of the pillars of its next success Whenever that happens that would be a longterm dream come true for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I wrote this article myself and it
