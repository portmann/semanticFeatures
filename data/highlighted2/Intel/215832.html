#A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced that it will invest up to billion in its Dalian China fab over the next years for producing SSDs This is a huge development for the companys data center business as its longterm goal is to become a complete provider of data center solutions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC announced last week that it will invest up to billion into its Dalian China wafer fabrication facility to transform it to a production base of leadingedge nonvolatile memory The facility which has been in operation since currently manufactures Intels nm chipsets for laptops PCs and servers Earlier this year the company announced that in collaboration with Micron Technology NASDAQ MU it will develop D NAND flash memory chips based on the D NAND and D XPoint technologies Many industry observers are speculating that Intels recent move can prove to be a threat to Micron with chipzilla possibly lowering its reliance on the JV with Micron Needham downgraded Micron to Hold from Strong Buy stating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>currently holds about market share in NAND versus Microns While details are still emerging as to Intels plans its focus on the nonvolatile memory market leaves us feeling that the pricing and supplydemand environment could come under pressure Yes certainly Its true that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>currently has a small share in the NAND market but it is aiming at grabbing a bigger slice from competitors like Samsung OTCSSNLF Western Digital NASDAQ WDC SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK and even its partner Micron In a previous article I analyzed how SanDisks enterprise SSD products were poised to drive its growth and share price Western Digitals acquisition of SanDisk will certainly strengthen its enterprise SSD product line but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is silently emerging as a tough competitor for the leading players in todays enterprise SSD market The revamp of Intels Dalian China facility is a significant step in that direction For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the NAND market is very important for its data center business The companys longterm goal is to become a complete provider of data center solutions beyond server chips such as fabric silicon photonics and nonvolatile memory Combined with its core x server chip revenue these solutions have the potential to grow Intels overall data center revenue at a much higher CAGR than the general expectation With the company having huge unutilized fab wafer fabrication facility capacity expanding its nonvolatile memory business certainly makes sense In fact it cant afford not to be in the SSD game <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cant afford not to be in the SSD market In todays era of softwaredefined storage processors and SSDs remain tightly coupled in a servers memoryCPU channel wherein SSDs are used as server accelerators Keeping cache and memory including NAND chips closely tied in a servers memoryCPU channel results in optimal performance as long as SSDs are used as server accelerators <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes will make lots of money by selling commodity server chips but by selling applicationspecific SSDs along with these chips the semiconductor giant can generate huge additional revenue How can it afford not to do that with its huge unutilized capacity in fabs When SSDs are used exclusively for storage purpose they might be kept elsewhere outside the server In such cases processors are irrelevant However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is aiming at redefining the boundary between memory and storage which in essence means that SSDs will act as either memory or storage or both depending on the situation Although processors are irrelevant here Intels SSDs will see greater demand than that of competitors due the x platform compatibility In a virtualized environment software assumes significant role and as I have said repetitively in my previous articles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is investing huge money in developing a standardized software ecosystem for data centers Such a software ecosystem will strengthen the platform compatibility leading to more demand for Intels NAND products Altera acquisition will boost Intels NAND chip business Alteras FPGAs field programmable gate arrays are widely used in enterprise SSD systems Intels plan is to make advanced server chips leveraging Alteras innovative FPGA architecture The company will certainly take advantage of Alteras FPGA architecture in building its NAND chips as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron via their JV known as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Micron Flash Technologies IMFT are in the process of making D XPoint chips that would be capable to access data x faster than currently available NAND chips <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is also planning to introduce NVMe nonvolatile memory express infrastructure for XPoint Alteras newly developed storage reference design based on its Arria SoCs can double the life of NAND chips according to a recent report The Altera acquisition will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>develop superfast D NAND chips with improved longevity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said it is aggressively working on bringing its D XPointbased Optane technologysupported SSDs to the marketplace possibly as early as in next year Micron now seems to be more of a competitor for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>than a partner Replacing spinning disk drives with highdensity NAND chips helps data centers mitigate critical challenges to a certain extent for improved IO performance Since NAND chips are capable of delivering fast writing performance at a significantly lower cost per bit data centers are fast adopting them Although the future of storage still lies in hybrid systems comprising of flash and spinning disk Intels NVMeaccessed D NAND chips might alter the equation in favor of flash Thats why I believe the companys memory push in the form of investing up to billion to its Dalian China facility in phases is a huge development for its data
