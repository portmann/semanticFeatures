Apples Mac The data confirms my expectations for the effect of the Windows upgrade program According to preliminary data by research firms IDC and Gartner Apples NASDAQ AAPL Mac line of personal computers continues to buck the overall decline in PC sales increasing market share in the process The purported slowdown in China that was supposed to be so devastating to Apple was nowhere to be seen My key thesis concerning the free upgrade offered by Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT to Windows was that this would tend to suppress sales of new PCs by Windows OEMs This was finally acknowledged in IDCs press release regarding Q PC sales and market share While Windows has generally received favorable reviews and raised consumer interest in PCs many users opted to upgrade existing PCs rather than purchase new hardware There continues to be the expectation promoted by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC mainly that new hardware would stimulate sales in Q Perhaps but I doubt it According to Microsoft about million have upgraded to Windows leaving a huge remaining pool of users over a billion that havent upgraded but could I expect Windows adoption to be rapid and OEM sales to continue to decline Except for Apple Apple has had a policy of free Mac OS X upgrades for some time and as the only vendor of Mac hardware doesnt have to worry about the effect of the upgrade policy The predictions of IDC and Gartner for Macs were a little closer together this quarter Both research firms placed Apple in the number position in PC sales globally and the number position in sales in the US Gartner is predicting slight yy unit growth of while IDC predicts a slight yy decline This is probably in the measurement noise for both companies Chances are that sales will be basically flat compared to calendar Q sales of million units This is not aweinspiring performance except in the context of the continuing implosion in PC sales which the Win upgrade has effectively accelerated According to IDC the yy decline in PC unit sales was according to Gartner it was PC sales in the US were basically flat yy the research firms agree while Mac sales grew in the US although the firms dont agree by how much IDC says US Mac sales grew by Gartner says they grew by The most significant aspect of the research reports is what they say about conditions in China as they bear on consumer spending for computers and Apple products in particular By now one would have expected the dire predictions of so many Apple bears regarding China to be manifest Yet there is very little sign of a China slowdown Gartner reports that PC sales in the AsiaPacific region showed a percent decline from calendar Q IDC wouldnt give specific numbers but for AsiaPacific excluding Japan did say that Volume was close to expectations this quarter The market was softer compared to the previous year due to currency impact on the region and clearing of channel inventory as the main priority for many countries Some big projects were postponed including an education project in India The commercial market was soft and was generally supported by government projects in many countries What was significant about the IDC statement was what they didnt say IDC didnt say that volume was down due to an economic slowdown in China Apples Mac sales also dont suggest much if any headwind in China Although flat year over year global sales of about million units represents a sequential increase Not what one would expect from a slowdown in one of Apples most important markets In the June quarter China represented about of Apples total revenue an increase of from the previous year For the first half of the year Apple reported that Mac sales had grown yy by greater than in China Continuing strong Mac sales indicates that China sales growth continues although not by the blistering pace of the first half of the year Ive repeatedly urged Apple investors to take a data driven approach to Apple rather than a rumor driven approach Ive pointed out in Why Apple Investors Shouldnt Fear China and in a follow up on Nikes NYSE NKE China earnings results that the data just wasnt there to support the idea of a recession or economic contraction in China Chinas economic growth rate may well be slowing Under the circumstances Ive expected the negative impact on Apple to be minimal and in the form of a slowing growth rate rather than a lack of growth or outright decline The Mac sales data appears to confirm this Mac sales growth in China may well be slowing from the yy pace of the past two quarters but will probably still post yy gains in China as well as sequential qq gains Although theres insufficient data to make quantitative predictions for China sales the available data continues to support my thesis that Chinas economy is stable and still growing albeit more slowly Rather than succumbing to panic I urge Apple investors to wait until Apple reports its fiscal Q results later this month which will provide much more reliable details about China Thats what Im doing We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not
