Alpha Qualcomm has recently joined Intelbacked Internet of Things group OCF The upcoming end of Moores Law is bringing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm closer Koomeys Law will drive chipmakers to produce technologically advanced chips in the absence of Moores Law Since the Internet of Things and WiGigWiFi dont need huge processing power <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm are wellpositioned in these areas compared to other chipmakers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM the semiconductor arch rivals are continuing their efforts to come closer to each other In a previous article I explained the rationale behind the collaboration between the two companies for taking WiGig mainstream A few days ago Qualcomm joined a new Internet of Things group named the Open Connectivity Foundation OCF in short OCF is actually the new name of the Intelbacked group Open Interconnect Consortium OIC in short In this article I explain how OCF will help the chipmakers grow together End of Moores Law Bringing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm Closer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was at the forefront of the OIC which was formed in for addressing the challenges of the Internet of Things Qualcomm was not a part of the group Instead it was a part of a competing group namely AllSeen Alliance Why has Qualcomm joined OCF which was originally backed by rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I am coming to that point In addition to Qualcomm Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Samsung OTCSSNLF have also joined OCF However the initiative has different implications for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm than the rest of the companies because both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm will face a stumbling block going forward that wont be conducive for their growth Whats that The end of Moores Law For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomm and other chipmakers that depend on consumers replacing the chips of their devices every two or three years the end of Moores Law could lead to significant revenue loss Amid such a situation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm have joined hands to grow together by taking advantage of their leadership position in PCs and smartphones respectively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has acknowledged that in future processors will become slower in terms of performance But at the same time they will be more energy efficient William Holt head of Intels Technology and Manufacturing Group recently said Were going to see major transitions The new technology will be fundamentally different The best pure technology improvements we can make will bring improvements in power consumption but will reduce speed Thats a revolutionary revelation which in essence means that Moores Law will come to an end The law suggested that the density of integrated circuits doubles every two years while the manufacturing cost reduces and therefore the chips become faster as well as cheaper Heres the paper containing the law which was published back in Once the chips hit nm on silicon chipmakers have to deal with quantum mechanics in terms of preventing quantum tunneling via logic gates Since quantum mechanics allows electrons to penetrate logic gates it is widely believed that nm will mark the end of Moores Law How would chipmakers make money when Moores Law ends The Internet of Things will save the chipmakers especially leaders like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm when Moores Law ends However they need to develop a welldefined ecosystem to retain their market share The primary problem with the Internet of Things is that most of the devices cant communicate with each other in the absence of a common ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm know this Qualcomm has agreed to become a part of Intelbacked OCF for developing an ecosystem Unlike the world of PCs and smartphones where the existence of a common ecosystem wasnt essential and therefore the IntelQualcomm rivalry wasnt a problem a common ecosystem will be most essential for the world of connected homes and cars When the Internet of Things will become fullblown there will be hundreds of devices in contrast to primarily PCs or smartphones today that will talk to one another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said By allowing providers to build on a single open standard OCF will drive secure interoperability for consumers business and industry which is key to unlocking the massive opportunity accelerating industry innovation speeding product development and spurring adoption Interoperability of different devices will create demand for more such devices For example a connected bulb will create the demand for a hub and a remote controller for switching the bulb on and off The bulb can also be operated without a remote controller using a smartphone or a tab In any case the demand for chips will rise to keep pace with increasing availability of different devices An article written by SA author Mark Hibben suggested that the collaboration between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm on WiGig doesnt necessarily imply they are becoming friends Hibben criticized my article mentioned in the beginning saying that its not unusual for rival companies to play nice to each other when it comes to developing standards and beyond that they remain competitors as usual I welcome constructive criticism because this helps us become better investors The things is after developing a common standard for the next technology frontiers such as WiGigWiFi or the Internet of Things chipmakers have to support hardware including chips made by even competitors to ensure smooth adoption of devices This is the building block of interoperability In the absence of Moores Law chipmakers will be driven by Koomeys Law to produce energyefficient chips Koomeys Law says At a fixed computing load the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half Koomeys Law doesnt deal with computing horsepower But thats not a problem The Internet of Things and WiGigWiFi the new growth areas for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm dont need much computing horsepower Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm are longterm buys Disclosure I amwe are long INTC QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long
