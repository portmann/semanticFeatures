style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cofounder Gordon Moores observation on the development of chip technology continues to impact technology and investment in the space Moores ideas on how powerful computing can become may give investors an idea on technologys next step forward This month marks the th anniversary of Moores Law a key observation made in an article written by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC cofounder Gordon Moore that successfully predicted the number of transistors per square inch on an integrated circuit would double every year The observation has had a profound impact on computing helping to usher in the use of everything from the earliest PCs to todays mobile devices Some have said Moores Law will eventually run out of steam Yet the observation has survived the test of time As technology transitions into a new era including the oftentalkedabout move into the Internet of Things IoT Moores ideas on how powerful computing can become may give investors an idea on technologys next step forward Russ Fischer has written about semiconductor stocks for Seeking Alpha since He spent years in the semiconductor industry and now in retirement spends his time doing the deep research necessary for successful investing Russ spent some time answering questions fielded by Seeking Alpha Editor Michael Hopkins about Moores Law the semiconductor space and whats next for technology Q What should investors know about Moores Law A Investors should know that Moores Law is not a physical law but an observation that Dr Gordon Moore wrote about back in Basically he felt that the number of components per integrated circuit at the same cost would approximately double each year for the foreseeable future He never said this phenomenon would continue indefinitely because the time horizon scope of the article was years It is interesting that Dr Moore predicted the home computer automotive controls and personal portable communications equipment Were talking here Serious investors could spend minutes and read the original article here A Millions of talented people have contributed to and extended the early prediction by Dr Moore Dr Moores prediction is now years old and seems to have a perpetual time horizon of years Consider The Apple NASDAQ AAPL A Application Processor was sq mm on a nm process Three nodes earlier was nm The A chip at nm would have been about sqmm sq in cost about and had more the characteristics of a hot plate than a cell phone processor Moores Law made the iPhone possible in and not very much earlier than that I like this one for IoT IoT chips will require sensing compute with onchip ROM and RAM communications wireless and security Whos better positioned than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Consider The first Pentium processor was made on an nm process and was about sq mm Eleven shrinks later that Pentium on nm would be about sq mm Thats a lot of intelligence that leaves room for the other functions and would still be a chip with gross margin Thats Moores Law at work to the extreme A You might profit from watching this Bloomberg video here Jack Rivkin thinks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the most important company in the world I cant think of another IDM that would have pushed fab technology the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has If that push hadnt happened many things that we take for granted couldnt exist today Even IBM NYSE IBM must have thought that Moores Law ended at nm Around nm IBM chose gate first lithography that they knew couldnt work below nm but it was easier and cheaper They took their whole consortium down that road The only one who went Gate Last was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IBM has since soldoff the semiconductor fabs as they were outmoded They actually paid Global Foundries a couple billion dollars to take the fabs off IBMs hands What if IBM had been the keeper of Moores Law Q Some say the observation is becoming dated that eventually Moores Law may not matter anymore Two questions Your thoughts on this and does that create an opening for investing in something new A Moores observation is becoming dated in the XY dimensions we still have the Z dimension to exploit We are seeing the early beginnings of D NAND memory IntelMicron NASDAQ MU the companies IM Flash is a joint venture feels that their D NAND implementation is cost disruptive which is what Moores Law is all about There is still a lot of mileage to be had by moving memory onto the CPU Maybe that will take a D logic process or inexpensive TSV Through Silicon Via technology Moores law has been expanded and reinterpreted by many people since If we expand performance and value to include performance at low power perhaps rearrangement of those billions of transistors to make a PC run on a couple AAA cells continues the value proposition that has always been the heart of Moores Law Q When it comes to traditional tech companies for lack of a better term say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>andor Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT theres one question that surfaces to the top Is the PC dead A Different PCs are born live and die We can only see an Apple IIs in a museum The boat anchor that was my first PC is long dead thank you very much Notebook PCs are still very relevant The number of PCs in use is still growing quite nicely When that number begins to shrink the PC will be dying Refresh cycles are getting extended for several reasons One reason is that PCs are much more reliable than ever before they last longer and dont need to be replaced I might point out that improved reliability is a seldom discussed element of Moores Law I also think the poor acceptance of Windows had more than a little bit to do with the decline in PC sales I would also argue that the PC business has been the victim to some degree of the Osborne Effect due to the rapid introduction and early announcement of ever more capable and lower powered CPU devices With Windows and the Skylake processor right around the corner we will see if my opinion has any validity I also feel that the PC industry has done a horrible job of helping users to move data from their old PC to a new PC Changing PCs has become a dreaded chore for many people That needs to change The traditional PC has run into a slow period while tablets have enjoyed an apparently short period of hyper popularity Tablets of course are PCs so no the PC is not dead A I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is finally getting traction in mobile as defined by tablet computers and smartphones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made some very expensive scorched earth progress in tablets last year Their LTE Baseband device is gaining ground at the expense of Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM The communications chip and processor chip are about equal in value Not all smartphones use the Qualcomm integrated solution and practically none of the cell networkenabled tablets use an integrated solution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will get their program together on a capable smartphone chip within the next months and unless the world stops using smartphones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be a factor The recent Microsoft Surface is no longer a joke but a serious computing device The introduction of the Surface seems to have obsoleted Windows RT which is another little cut to ARM ARM TSMC NYSE TSM and Qualcomm Q Theres offandon talk concerning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acquiring Altera NASDAQ ALTR something that has caught the attention of Wall Street Could there be consolidation in the semiconductor space I have to thump my chest a little bit I was told that I sold the first forrevenue FPGA for Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX Since Xilinx was the first and only FPGA company at the time I sold the first FPGA on planet Earth FPGAs as accelerators for data center server chips make a lot of sense in a market that seems to demand customization FPGAs are reconfigurable so a single device could in theory execute many different custom algorithms at different times as required by the system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been quietly doing fab work for a couple of startup FPGA companies for years the closest one to marketing a product is Achronix details here Achronix is on the market with FPGAs made on the intel nm process These are very dense very fast FPGAs that have the distinct advantage of being totally and immediately compatible with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>manufacturing Im surprised that Achronix wasnt the first company to be considered for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>purchase Maybe they will be considered now Another device that could perform some of the acceleration functions on server CPUs is the Micron Automata Processor here The acceleration and customization demand on server application will be satisfied by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>whether through FPGAs or the Automata Processor or both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will spend any amount of money to defend or enhance their position in the data center business so Xilinx Altera or Achronix will come under the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>umbrella Any deal would should happen in the near future so maybe the play is AlteraXilinx call options at about months out Q Who benefits with further consolidation should that happen A Consolidation decoded means less competition In that sense it is shortterm bad for consumers of semiconductor devices Long term it is good for everyone that the semiconductor industry generates the ROI necessary to continue a high level of innovation which benefits those same consumers of semiconductor devices There has already been a lot of consolidation in the semiconductor business and it will continue where it makes business sense A semiconductor deal that looks highly dilutive to earnings can turn very accretive with some pricing solidification by the acquirer I would look for candidates that either reduce or eliminate competition in certain product categories as being the companies of interest for further consolidation Qualcomm could be shopping for some other businesses since their mobile and communication businesses are facing some real competition today If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants to dominate the IoT market a sensor company would be a nice tidbit Invensense NYSE INVN comes to mind A Actually I am flat on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for now I expect to be back in big for the second half and I have an eye on Integrated Device Technology NASDAQ IDTI for their memory support products and power control products They have an analyst meeting coming up in May I might be in it before that The date is not yet announced The D NAND memory shakeout is worth watching All four suppliers fabs use a different technology so there are no D NAND technologies with true second sources Toshiba does the fab for themselves and SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK and IMFT does the D fab for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the unique position of being a true second source to Micron fabs by opening up an Intelowned D NAND fab The IntelMicron joint venture allows for that Simply having a second source could make IntelMicron their joint venture the selected D NAND technology A Im still watching for the final outcome in the and nm struggle On the one side is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with an ongoing billion in X revenue to fund the ever more expensive technology development The foundries including TSMC and Samsung OTCSSNLF are throwing truckloads of money at what amounts to about a billion worth of nonIntel bleeding edge business billion for Apple and billion for everyone else They are currently spending about twice the amount of the available business How long can that continue The rumors are that both TSMC and Samsung have horrible yield on nm finfet processes and that the costs of finfet transistors are increasing for the first time while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>claims their transistor cost continues to come down If one of the foundries throws in the towel on finfet there will be an audible worldwide gasp from the bleeding edge semiconductor users Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>go home with all the process marbles Disclosure The most recent update from Russ is that he is short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>puts with the objective of being assigned the shares at a lower cost or keeping the premium He may initiate a call spread for a shortterm small bull play on earnings which were reported after
