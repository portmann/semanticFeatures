Another AMD Buyout Makes Sense But Is Unlikely Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha This is the second significant rumor of AMD being bought out by Microsoft AMDs struggling business and vertical integration for Microsoft justified this reasoning Rumor has it and has had it for several months on more than one occasion that Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD is going to be acquired Theres been Samsung OTCSSNLF BLX and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT to name a few This is the second significant buyout rumor concerning Microsoft that weve learned of with the last being just in June This time Fudzilla states that Microsoft is seriously talking to AMD about an acquisition There are a number of reasons why these rumors have some merit with the biggest being AMDs rough business situation However a Microsoft acquisition seems a bit out of place Sure Microsoft can vertically integrate its products with AMDs chips but what about its strong relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC And how will this affect Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA who is very reliant on sales to Windows customers I suppose its plausible but I dont see how itll fly There are two reasons why it makes sense for Microsoft to acquire AMD The first and biggest is due to AMDs risk of bankruptcy About a year ago we learned about AMDs new architecture Zen which is the only product that investors should be concerned with in the long run With its debut occurring sometime in mid its been all about surviving until then Investors were fairly comfortable with this idea because AMD was steadily nearing profitability throughout and claimed that it would be profitable in However AMDs most recent earnings report notes a decrease in revenue YOY and a loss of M Furthermore AMDs gross margins fell to from YOY and the company only expects a increase in revenue for its upcoming quarter the peak quarter of the year Theres no question that the business is in trouble and bailing investors drove the stock to an alltime low With so much trouble AMD may need a savior and Microsoft could be just that The second is for Microsoft to be able to run a cheaper vertically integrated business like its arch rival Apple NASDAQ AAPL Apple has prided itself in handling the software and hardware side of its product but with iOS its taken it a step further by designing its own ARM processors This has been very profitable for Apple but since Windows is x based Microsoft can only obtain chips from either AMD or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which is expensive This affects Microsofts pricing power and if iPad and Surface go to war pricing may become a concern and might only be within Apples ability There are a variety of reasons why this acquisition doesnt make sense and in this section I will discuss four reasons which should be enough First theres AMDs heavily diversified product portfolio AMD knew that living with its Bulldozer cores was going to be a survival game so under exCEO Rory Read AMD started to temporarily branch away from the PC and focus on things like embedded medical gaming consoles professional graphics and more If this never happened AMD wouldnt be here today because AMDs PC and graphics revenue was an unbearable M down YOY Outside of those segments which includes consoles enterprise and embedded AMD generated M That segment is expected to grow as AMD adopts more design wins such as this new Fujitsu ThinClient design win and the new semicustom design win that will start adding revenue next year These are at least halfdecade commitments and I dont see where Microsoft fits into all of this Second theres Wintel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been Microsofts best friend since the start of the industry and if Microsoft acquires AMD for its x capabilities its a little difficult to see where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will play a role in all of this While AMD may not be competitive with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at the moment Zen is expected to be a major contender and a leap forward that could close or dramatically reduce the gap AMD has and probably wont have a product that can power the Surface tablets anytime soon so I dont know how betraying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to play in Microsofts favor Third is Nvidia AMDs other competitor If Microsoft were to acquire AMD Nvidia would be dropped in quicksand Sure Nvidia is a bit of a jerk in its pricing schemes so some may say that they deserve just that However theres a lot more than silicon that goes into graphics products and with both Windows and AMDs Radeon under Microsofts wing I cant imagine how this would go well or be fair in anyway to Nvidia It has been suggested that AMD may spin off its graphics unit and simply license it back for its APU but that doesnt alter this problem very much Fourth and lastly is that AMD has a greater upside on its own AMD is standing above a gold mine as it has both a strong computing and graphics API under its sleeve Nvidia has no x license and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still way behind in graphics If AMD overcomes this hurdle and launches Zen along with its graphics API you can expect to see AMDs stock triple or quadruple in a very short amount of time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is worth B Nvidia is worth B and AMD who has the chance to thrive in both markets is worth only B Why would AMD want to give away all that upside Theres no doubt that AMD is in trouble and needs a little bit of cash to get by which is chump change for Microsoft so perhaps this is why these rumors are taken seriously by investors However there are ethical problems with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia being victims and worries on whether or not Microsoft can even manage the company Im sure the Nokia fall through isnt going to give Microsoft a strong argument Disclosure I amwe are long AMD MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am
