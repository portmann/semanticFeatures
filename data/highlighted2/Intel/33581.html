AMD Falling Into The Abyss Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMDs earnings seem to have surprised many people they shouldnt have Q will be a very poor quarter for the company By now most readers have seen the Q earnings AMD NASDAQ AMD released on Thursday and have seen all the gloom and doom scenarios written and the overall pessimism regarding the stock The earnings more or less played out the only way they could have once we knew what the market looked like and we saw AMD was not releasing new graphics processors So well go over what happened in the earnings fairly dispassionately To understand AMD you still have to understand the PC market and the relative positions of the companies This is more difficult to do than it sounds as people are quite passionate about AMD and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC but it still has to be attempted AMDroids want to think Carrizo is the greatest thing since the ABomb just like Kaveri was supposed to be Well its not although it is a bomb in a different sense Even smart people talk about these inferior products in a manner that AMD announces them without any further thought Its easy to believe what you want But these are not good parts and do not compete with Intels better designed products This understanding is fundamental to correctly evaluating the investment potential of the company Lets first differentiate between price and cost because they are two completely different things Price is what the market will bear Cost is what it takes to create the part It is not the same as price in any way Its critical to understand the difference because that gives insight into the possibilities or lack thereof for the company Many times people talk about how AMDs parts are competitive at lower price points with Intels and thats good for them Well not really It might be good for you if youre looking to buy something but as an investor it just means the market wont pay much for it Thats not a good thing So one has to compare the cost to see if a design works or not Size gives a rough estimation of cost although there are many factors But one thing is clear the Bulldozer line of processors are not inexpensive to make as AMDs margins are relatively low And thats because the design is poor Even the company has decided the design is so poor it should not be continued There are other issues for the company and well touch on them but the most significant is the big processors are poorly designed and not competitive Carrizo is not going to change that Its just how it is With that in mind the earnings had to be poor because Intels were AMD does have better chips than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the lowend but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is being extremely aggressive with pricing simply because they have to be they have fabs they need to keep busy AMD noted their smaller chips had been doing very well in previous quarters but we did not get any information like this in Q But it starts and ends with Intels superiority in the big chips because this finances segments where they lose money Although the earnings report was pretty predictable this does not mean nothing of interest came from it Well go over some of the points in the conference call that I found interesting or revealing Lets first establish that the only way for AMD to survive is to take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on and go head to head <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going after every market so how can it be avoided Rather than concede the big processor segment of PC market and servers AMD has to put it in play Its the easiest market because there are only two players and Intels recent products run from awful Bay Trail family to disappointing Haswell to wondering if its even better than the predecessor Broadwell Many still view Intels fabrication technology as a key obstacle to AMD releasing competitive products Thats understandable because years ago it mattered a lot It no longer does Did Ivy Bridge nm really improve significantly over Sandy Bridge No not really in fact in some ways it was worse Did Broadwell nm significantly improve on Haswell Overall clearly it did not So fabrication technology matter much less now as shrinks do not bestow the same kinds of advantages in clock speeds like they used to nor the same drop in transistor cost In fact for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the nm Sandy Bridge is still considered their best overclocker On top of this TSMC NYSE TSM and Samsung OTCSSNLF have significantly closed the gap Clearly then this does not prevent AMD from competing in performance I bring this up because Lisa Su has made it clear shes going for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Theres no way around it and its a battle they can win By ditching SeaMicro and by increasing big server investments which she indicated AMD did the company is clearly being aggressive about the traditional server market It also indicates a vote of confidence for the newly designed processors coming out in It is also important to note that this has implications outside of the server context since the mainstream market will be essentially the same technology It was critical the company accept this challenge Thats the crux of the situation AMD will continue to struggle in until the new design known as Zen is available to compete in the higher end of the x market Until then theres going to be pain Ive said this since Kaveri came out and bombed and it took no insight to say it Its just that obvious But there were other points to consider from the earnings although none are as important as that Embedded was flat year to year and thats unexpected and quite disappointing since AMD had put a lot of effort into growing that segment Is it a short term blip or does it show a general weakness in AMDs offerings Because it was caused by a drop in thin client demand it appears more likely an aberration as other subsegments increased enough to offset it Still we should keep an eye on this as the year unfolds The GPU market was horrible but that was expected AMD simply doesnt have competitive technology remember the difference between cost and price when evaluating this and so continue to suffer In addition to this the company is clearing downstream inventory However management indicated they expect to gain market share with the new product releases which is in sharp contrast to lack of such predictions in the PC market With regards to the PC market the word hope was used giving no indication of real expectations Rory Read and Su both said they focusing on more commercial sales last year and in the conference call it was indicated that this happened So thats a good thing except it is improving on such a small number its not clear how much significance to attach to this Minimally it does give some credibility to management in terms of keeping predictions though We also got more information on the two new semicustom wins AMD won for Revenue will now be in the second half of the year whereas before we were just told without any reference as to when in One disturbing part of the conference call is apparently AMDs new GPUs will not be out until the second half of the year Lisa Su said were also launching some graphics products in the second half of this year So any relief in the GPU segment is at least a quarter away Expect Q to be fairly abysmal Carrizo is not going to save the day When they were discussing the wafer agreement it became very clear the back end of the year is heavily weighted and the GPUs are one reason Console chips will be another The Windows release will cause OEMs to lean out their inventory in quarters leading to its release with the consequent increase after One point that impressed me about Su was she was quite open and honest that she was not sure how much of an impact Windows would have This is sensible because theres no precedence for it considering the market conditions and the fact Windows and users get a free upgrade to Windows Intels management seemed a bit more concrete with their predictions which is alarming since they so badly mispredicted the impact of Windows XP support ending this quarter One thing that is clear though is for consumer parts inventory levels will be kept relatively low by OEMs since they have to play it safe So even if consumers are indifferent to the release of Windows there will be that impact Q is just not going to be pleasant Overall I was pretty happy with the conference call because AMD is a very simple company to figure out If Zen is a good product AMD will do very well If anything the extra investment in the server platform indicates AMD has much more confidence in this processor than it does with the Bulldozer line which was never competitive except in very limited scenarios Im a bit disappointed by the new GPUs being released in the second half but was more encouraged by the continued success in the professional GPU segment which is more important going forward Greater commercial shipments also could be quite positive particularly as AMD develops more competitive technology in So it might look bad particularly the numbers but theres probably more good coming from it than bad provided one had realistic expectations going in If not hopefully you will for Q which is going to be bad Theres just no other possible scenario Source Is
