Theory Of Apples Product Success Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple SVP of Marketing has presented Apples philosophy underlying its computing products This has been called a grand unified theory but it leaves unexplained Apples unique success Apple has been most successful in its smallest and most energy efficient devices In a recent article SA contributor Neil Cybart presented what he called The Grand Unified Theory of Apple Products based on statements made by Apple NASDAQ AAPL SVP of Marketing Phil Schiller Cybarts is an interesting and enjoyable article but I found myself interpreting Schillers statements a little differently In this article I present my own Theory of Apple Product Success aimed at explaining why products such as the iPhone have been so successful a topic of immediate interest to investors Let me take as my point of departure Phill Schillers statement which appeared in Backchannel We are in an amazing time where there are different ideas competing for your computing life Thats greatwe love that And we have thought long and deep about what choices we want to offer customers One is iPadit can do many things you want to do on a PC so many that people choose to make it their primary computing device and it can do that Thats more true with the iPad Pro than its ever been But thats not everybody There are other people who will decide that nothing does the things they need in their lives as well as a Mac They are all computers Each one is offering something unique and each is made with a simple form that is pretty eternal The job of the watch is to do more and more things on your wrist so that you dont need to pick up your phone as often The job of the phone is to do more and more things such that maybe you dont need your iPad and it should be always trying and striving to do that The job of the iPad should be to be so powerful and capable that you never need a notebook The job of the notebook is to make it so you never need a desktop right Its been doing this for a decade So that leaves the poor desktop at the end of the line Whats its job Its job is to challenge what we think a computer can do and do things that no computer has ever done before be more and more powerful and capable so that we need a desktop because of its capabilities Because if all its doing is competing with the notebook and being thinner and lighter then it doesnt need to be What Phil says strikes me as a perfectly sensible statement of a product positioning strategy but Im not sure it quite rises to the level of a grand unified theory of anything Part of my reason is that virtually everybody in the computer industry is offering the same range of devices as Apple This nonunique product positioning doesnt serve to explain Apples success or provide a conceptual framework for investors to predict future success Theres also the danger of taking the second paragraph of the above statement a little too literally more literally Im sure than Schiller intended The statement implies that Watch only performs a subset of functions of the iPhone iPhone only performs a subset of functions of iPad and iPad only performs a subset of functions of MacBook and so on In fact each device offers unique capabilities not offered by the other device groups I illustrate the difference in the chart below may John Venn forgive me For simplicity I chose not to separate iPhone and iPad I point out that each operating system group offers unique capabilities because I consider that actually very important to Apples success with its products Any unified theory should account for this and its a point Ill return to later in the article One point that Cybart made that I thought was very important was when he showed a frame from Apples March special event where the Watch was launched Cybart refers to the product lineup shown as a spectrum of products Indeed it is and the important way in which it is a spectrum is that the products represent a range of electrical power consumption as I indicate above If theres a unifying conceptual framework for Apples products I sense that it lies in this range of power consumption Theres been an ongoing trend in the history of computing devices from the earliest vacuum tube computers to the present of reducing the power consumption of the fundamental computing element These computing elements can be vacuum tubes transistors or in the case of the human brain a neuron In the chart below I illustrate the progress weve made in reducing the power per computing element for various systems In the chart above the ENIAC was an early vacuum tube computer The University of Manchester computer was one of the earliest based on discrete transistors The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was the first commercially available microprocessor The reductions in power consumption per transistor have gone hand in hand with the reductions in size as integrated circuits have shrunk The reductions in power consumption have enabled the mobile device revolution and continue to reduce the power consumed by our mobile devices even as battery technology has stood relatively still How This Relates to Apples Product Positioning The improvements in computing element efficiency have been an industry wide trend so this doesnt in itself explain Apples success with its products The key to Apples success has been its ability to anticipate the trend and get out in front of it The iPhone is the classic example of this The iPhone anticipated handheld computers becoming much more powerful than they were in when the iPhone was introduced The iPhone was a solution to the problem that didnt yet exist of how to provide a workable user interface for a computing device with a relatively tiny screen and nothing else At the time the iPhone touchscreen as cool as it was seemed like overkill for what you could actually do with the phone iPhone was an answer to the question of what a computer of that size and power could do in order to be useful At the time the answer was be a smarter type of mobile phone Being a phone was the principal unique capability that set iPhone apart from other Apple computers It was very necessary to find just such a capability to justify the existence of what otherwise was a not very powerful handheld computer But eventually processing technology and a larger screen size would make the iPhone a much more powerful and useful personal computing device Apple Watch is an attempt to anticipate the next even smaller even lower power mobile computing device Its an attempt to answer the question of what can a device of that size and power do in order to be useful and the initial answer is to be a smarter type of watch As in the early iPhone being a watch gives it a unique set of capabilities that justifies what is otherwise a not very powerful wrist worn computer But eventually processing technology and a larger screen size will make the Watch a much more powerful and useful personal computing device as well Each year we see more and more computing capability pushed down into the smaller device categories in Apples product line Eventually well see much of the current iPhone capability pushed into the Watch including GPS and cellular data voice communication and even Facetime WatchOS apps will become more powerful and the Watch much less dependent on its data link with the iPhone As Phil Schiller indicated at each product group level Apple is trying to push as much capability as possible into a given level A key to Apples success is doing that before its competition The process is ongoing and occurs on both the hardware and operating system fronts As Ive pointed out before Apples A processor in the new iPhone s s Plus appears to be the fastest and most energy efficient overall of any smartphone based on performance and battery life benchmarks reported by Anandtech Apples iOS brought multitasking features to the iPad once again an example of pushing more compute capability into lower power devices My theory of Apples product success is that Apple has anticipated the trend in increasing efficiency of computing devices to exploit low power computing applications The trend consistently is to smaller lower power devices and then grow the capability of the devices as efficiency improves In this model of product development Watch is still in its infancy and it may take several generations of the Watch to achieve the kind of success that iPhone has In this model theres always the danger of some cannibalism and it can be argued that larger screen iPhones may have cannibalized iPad The problem of cannibalism is offset by the Jevons paradox that says that as a technology becomes more efficient such as processors with respect to electrical efficiency economic factors promote greater use of the technology This has the paradoxical effect of increasing the overall consumption of the resource in this case electricity I would suggest a corollary to the Jevons paradox If a technology is more efficient than a competing similar technology then it will be preferred in the marketplace According to this corollary mobile devices have become more prevalent precisely because they were the more electrically efficient form of computer And among mobile devices the more electrically efficient will also be selected preferentially by consumers and become dominant in the marketplace The Jevons paradox corollary explains nicely why Apples revenues have grown as it has gravitated toward smaller lower power and more electrically efficient computing devices This suggests that the future of Apple Watch and other wearables that Apple may develop is
