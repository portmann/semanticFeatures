Fate of The Tech Bubble Is In The Hands Of Just One Company Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Today China remains central to the notion that the world is in recovery Itis believed to be growing at not as rapid as the growth were used to seeing but still Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site With the Nasdaq sitting at new highs having finally eclipsed the previous record of set in March of and with consumers notsoeagerly awaiting their chance to get in on the supposed wave of the wearables future by purchasing their very own Apple Watch we learn that the fate of the tech bubble now rests entirely on the shoulders of Tim Cook because as FactSet notes blended Q YY EPS growth for the Information Technology sector is but excluding Apple the blended earnings growth rate for the sector would fall to And as it turns out its not just the tech space YY EPS growth for the entire SP is expected to come in at excluding Apple knocks more than a full percentage point off the already negative results The blended earnings decline for the entire SP is Excluding Apple the blendedearnings decline for the SP would increase to Fri localsavage Fri tmmyBerg It is actually amazing they have held up until now I gave them one year from the death of Jobs The iPhone refresh set up a new cycle of buying though Now that that has largely run its course what next As you say absolutely nothing Fri zaphod I know more and more Apple people who are switching from iPhone to Android or who have all MacAirs but just got a Dell XPS There is no functional difference between iOS or Android for phones or Mac and Win for consumer PCs Well except for the limited choice and high cost on the Apple side Fri random Fri Herd Redirectio Whats funny is Apple think their success was due to marketing hence why change anything in the company if the marketing is good they can do no wrong They completely forget all the WORD OF MOUTH advertising Apple users USED to give Constantly promoting Apple products to their friends Who in their right mind would do so today And which idiotic friend would believe that an iPhone iWatch etc is worth the price Fri BobPaulson The stock buybacks were the first big sign of a coming iCrash How can a company think there is more return on buying their stock than growing their business and developing new products Fri KarlHungus I confess I do love my MacBook I have hated every new windows OS in years and the phones are even worse I like my iPhone too But I wont be propping them my purchases I actually use things until they quit working and care nothing for having the latest and greatest My MacBook is years old and still going strong just got an iPhone s about months ago after my year old iPhone stopped working In my personal experience they do make quality products but the companies valuation is the pinnacle of irrational exuberance and I dont think its going to end well for most holders of their stock Fri Au_Ag_CuPbCu I have a really hard time reconciling buying a watch that requires me to carry a phone that will pretty much do the same thing as the watchsayin Fri BullyBearish Fri NoDebt It has nothing to do with that The Csuite is getting paid almost exclusively on share price of the company And its not just Apple Fri BullyBearish OKlets see how well the C suite can keep the price up when the OWNERS decide its time to sell Fri MonetaryApostate Success is only temporary and rarely long lasting take what you can get and then move on to something new Innovation is what made Apple successful for a time but if their innovation stalls or fails to deliver awesome products down goes the legacy As we see is happening now No matter what the price of the products were Herd people still bought them regardless and Apple had the capital to invest in more new innovations but we shall see what comes Something tells me Jobs cashed out because he knew the end was near not just for himself but the company as well A Great Leader died they cant replace him Also major team members left like Guy Kawasaki who went to Google and so you can probably see the end drawing near In the world of crony capitalism you have got to realize when the captain abandons ship its time for you to as well Fri Dubaibanker One of the biggest scams in the US is the corporations NOT paying most of their taxes while the individuals get thrown into jail and pay penalties for having a Swiss bank ac Go figure As of Tech and digital technology being the leading contemporary and high potential growth sector no one exemplifies tax evasion by US corporations better than Apple Just like Apple dozens of top US corporations either do not pay taxes or barely pay any The stash runs into trillion dollars kept overseas while the individual taxpayers bear the brunt of poor healthcare low policing crumbling infrastructure and higher prison costs etc When will anyone call their senator to demand equality and grow some balls Heres What Could Be Fixed by the Taxes on Apples Offshored Profits Apple hoards of cash overseas fearing high US tax rates On the other hand we have CAPITALIST China where everything is run by the book and rules are equal and followed by all Last week Alibaba the largest tech company and a major competitor to almost all US tech companies rolled into one paid a solid USD billion in taxes to the Govt of China Alibaba Hailed as Chinas Top TaxPaying Internet Firm Fri BeaverCream Yes we need more tax revenues so we can expand the welfare state and pay off Obamas hawaii vacations Federal taxes dont provide me with shit so I dont care Fri Dubaibanker There is wastage for sure like Obamas vacations but we still need to pay taxes to have some form of civil society You will get access to pensions emergency health care when required and a general sense of safety hydro decent roads and kids education etc You get all that like an umbrella When it rains you may get some drops of water on you but you wont get drenched when you need it the most If you were the POTUS would you not wish to have a few vacations as a perk being the most powerful person and all that jazz Fri Dubaibanker US lost its grip in the last decade MIC has overwhelmed the national fabric for the sake of greed and money and in order to continue to hold the grip on the slipping power A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE WHO WISHES TO UNDERSTAND WHATS GOING ON FOR THE LAST YEARSI DID NOT REALISE UNTIL TODAY THAT THE BRITISH WERE RULING THE AMERICANSFASCINATING WATCH Fri InjuredThales Theres nothing small government about Somalia Somalia is a civil war zone between multiple competing big government contenders They all want to tell you who you can date how old you need to be to do so what you can eat how many times you can pray each day and so on and then complete idiots like this fucktard try to tell us that this is the devolution of the libertarian ideal Im sorry but no thanks to the state I already have access to health care and I take care of my own and ask nothing for it No thanks to the state I am saving enough double no thanks to provide for my future Im not having kids so fuck em I dont want a fucking sense of safety I want a sense of freedom so fuck the state on that too Im pretty sure that people would be lining up to sell me power no mater what so fuck the state on that Most of the subways in both New York and London were built before the state owned em so fuck the state Im pretty sure that roads that cost a fraction would be built without its machinations Stay in your shithole You deserve it There is a bigger good to be had for all humans by living in a society being social animals But you wont get itbecause you want to live lonely and die lonely A pity Fri TheAntiProgressive Yeah well society is full of people and generally people just are not that great especially if they want something and cant provide it for themselves Try dumping the bankster free ride role and try on a retail job for months and comment again Fri KarlHungus Pull your head out of your ass There is a huge difference between society and government With all your muh roads bullshit you would probably fit in a lot better on huffpo or salon Fri I woke up DB Ive read alot of your posts and you have provided some good insight but I have to disagree with this greater good meme its what takes power from the people and gives it to a few Its readily aparent that it not working out so well so Id like to try the opposite for a while Fri Ward cleaver Sir have you ever heard of a role model When of the country is living paycheck to paycheck do you think it wise for the POTUS to be so visible in his wasting of those same peoples taxes Its just that he simply doesnt care Fri cnmcdee Taxes are horse shit never in US history have either the democrats or republicans veteod a deficit budget no matter what the income tax rate is they are incapable of managing their money And it is completely irrelevant what the income tax rate goes to governments always will spend every penny given them and seek for more consider places like Sweden and their national debt deficit even though their taxes are approaching The reality is governments must be banned forever from borrowing or from taxing and derive their income through the issuance of currency as a percentage of gdp and encased in constitutional law with all departments and employees payed as a percentage of of this figure If they need more money for a project it must be approved by the people via vote card or it cannot be Fri kchrisc Fri Dubaibanker Companies pay taxes in all other parts of the world except tax havens of which Delaware is also a part A company is defined as a legal person in every corporate law book globally Laws must be equal for every person legal and individual alike For example if I sell something to you I must pay taxes as individual on its profit for example could be an investment property or a boat or a diamond or whatever else However if I use my company to sell why should it be any different Income is an income Most companies in other countries have not had the global reach that US corporations did over the last years Only China today is comparable in scale and size When Chinese companies can pay taxes in their country or UK companies then why US companies hesitate to pay and always use lobbyists to find a loophole Fri Mr Pink You failed to name one fucking thing that is paid for by federal income tax Please enlighten me as to what we get from the feds besides endless wars and bail outs for the TBTF Fri Dubaibanker All this radical polarization created by MIC started barely years ago until when US was a prosperous nation Now all money goes into the pockets of corporations billionaires and a few bankstersand endless creation of new terrorists by bombing normal peoples homes None of the ZH spammers are reading you May be they cant and that is the problem All you points are completely valid only idiots are down arrowing you Fri Grimaldus China is run by the book huh The book of one despotic regime after another for thousands of years killing tens of millions of their own citizens What is the police state doing in US for the last years How many blacks and others have been killed in the US Is that not the same killing own citizens Fri Grimaldus China killed moar of its own citizens than the total number of death for any reason at the hands of American progressive criminal governments Fri AmarUtu Fri Ward cleaver Hitlery says having more than one item is impossible to manage That is why she was so great as SOS cause u dont need to multi task Fri localsavage If they could get the cell companies and phone manufacturers to quit messing up and adding their shit to the android phones OS Crapple would be done Fri Oh regional Indian Fri I need more asshats Fri kml Android is very competitive with iPhone but MacOS is still light years ahead of Windows Not to mention the build quality of Macs versus PC laptops the closest Dell can get is a secondrate knockoff Mac prices are also becoming much more reasonable Fri McMolotov Completely agree on all points Windows is basically a virus masquerading as an operating system Im a Linux guy but I use MacOS for work and its so much better than Windows so much more logical theres just no comparison Also no BSOD I get that most people are forced to use Windows at work but I have no idea why anyone would want to willingly inflict Windows on themselves at home when there are better alternatives Fri kml Microsofts only saving grace is that Windows was first to market and many people dont want to learn something new Windows and MacOS quality have been on opposite trajectories since XP I made the switch about years ago I will not buy another PC laptop Mac hardware and Parallels to run WindowsLinux if needed is where its at Fri MayIMommaDogFac I hate Microsoft but I have not seen a BSOD in about years versions of OS and I really put my machines through the paces both hardware and software wise Fri MonetaryApostate Regardless of it being a freaking NSA spy box even linux has been proven to be nothing short of the same and even Linus Travold said the code had become extremely over bloated hard to manage with all of the new innovation out so its definitely NOT the original Linux that he originally produced Far from it really Some distros will crash on you if they dont support your hardware Often because its too new and so the tables have turned and Linux may be considered by the dumb masses as Buggy I dont care what the Linux fan bois say to the contrary Linux is NOT perfect Far from it really However its still suitable for certain task and its still far superior in Kernel to Windows However there is the hackablity of Windows Issue which I hope they do one day put to an end but I wont hold my breath truly Fri EdSav On Windows keeping with the theme they really gayd up the BSOD There is a frownyface and everything and a cute message referring to the kernel dump as Were collecting information about this crash and then well restart your computer I have been into computers and technology for a very long time and I hate what it has become and what it seeks to be I hope it implodes under the weight of its hipsterdouchiness Also of note pretty sure that this is the first new generation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors in which their predecessors beat them in nearly every task nm vs nm So much that in most usage scenarios it can result in higher power consumption via constant thermal throttling nm has less area to disperse heat from core Give it a year and Ill move to Banshee Pennsylvania and call myself Proctor Fri froze Fri McMolotov I realize this is just anecdotal but I have a G tower thats been running everyday for the past eight years for work and I havent had a single issue with it If you open it up and look at the guts it looks like fucking miniature magic elves with OCD put it together Do NOT follow this link or
