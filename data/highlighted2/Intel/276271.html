offers a significant boost to readwrite speeds when compared to consumer SSDs but is still too expensive for consumer adoption However when compared to enterprise HDDs the cost disadvantage seems to have narrowed a little The narrowing of cost will support Intels storage revenue growth but I dont anticipate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to generate mind boggling numbers quite yet My time frame for cost parity of NAND with HDDs is due to trends in cost per GB pricing While Im optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I think investors have gotten a little carried away with expectations on sales and earnings from enterprise storage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU made some pretty big promises on the future potential of DXpoint and D NAND But when doing further research on the specifications Im really starting to wonder whether there are useful applications for main system storage thats as fast as shortterm memory Furthermore pricing information is not available for its nextgeneration technology but given Intels lineup of enterprise grade SSDs not reaching cost parity with enterprise HDDs my excitement on the cost front is more muted Intels current storage offerings are significantly faster in terms of readwrite speeds when compared to consumer class SSDs However even with the readwrite speeds being anywhere from to times better due to improvements in cell density and various other technologies the cost per GB seems fairly prohibitive When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made presentations on the future of its SSD technologies they mentioned that it would be fairly cost disruptive due to the transition from D NAND to D NAND which Samsung markets as VNAND What ended up happening was that the cost of these faster solutions didnt keep pace with competitors in the past year and the marginal performance improvement was nonexistent according to an indepth real world performance test with the exception of vastly improved random access read and write speeds In other words the incremental performance advantage of Intels current storage offerings doesnt justify such a massive pricing premium so consumers wont be using Intelbranded SSDs for quite a while SSDs typically sell for around to cents per GB but Intels SSD costs around cents per GB which is approximately x more expensive with very minimal performance gain From my perspective the cost of producing these NAND equivalents were supposed to be inline with the broader industry so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could compete on both cost and performance Instead the cost of manufacturing each wafer is still prohibitive for whatever reason or the company is pricing its new technology too aggressively The engineer made comments at the Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>partnership update back in March of about the cost disruptiveness of verticallystacked NAND cells When talking about cost the engineer was pretty vague but pointed out an exponential path to lowering costs at the wafer level We fast forward a couple quarters and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>arrives with the most expensive NAND storage solutions whereas every other storage player has implemented aggressive strategies to lower the cost per GB particularly Samsung and Mushkin Whats interesting is that Micron is the provider of nm NAND for the Mushkin Reactor and is priced more appropriately at cents per GB for the GB drive Again reasonable with very little performance compromise when compared to Intels series In other words Micron seems better positioned to leverage D NAND in the consumer space but its not the market leader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mentions that the TAM will grow by x in the span of three years For some reason Im skeptical of Intels claims that the market will expand as rapidly It would be more believable had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>released an SSD product with mbps read speeds and mbps write speeds at a price point below per GB In that scenario the market could have rapidly responded to the technology because its both cost and performance disruptive These enterprise facing drives have to compete with storage thats somewhat cheaper According to Oppenheimer the enterprise storage market can be broken down into four broad categories fiber channel storage area network network attached storage internet small computer interface storage area network and directattached storage The entire storage market contracted this year in terms of pricing but overall storage needs grew NANDbased storage doesnt compose a meaningful amount of the storage volume and its more expensive when compared to hard disk drive storage which is why many data center designers will situate frequently used data on the faster SSDs and leave much of the older archives on HDDs Its also common for backups to be situated on HDDs which is why the progression of SSDs into the enterprise has been slow The above figure is in terms of millions of TBs of storage with capacity at Petabytes The pricing is derived from the industry revenue divided by the total storage capacity which is estimated to be per GB from my own calculations due to rounding whereas Oppenheimer calculated per GB The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SSD costs around per GB so the cost needed to come down a little more to be fully competitive with industry averaged pricing Furthermore the cost dynamics of HDDs for servers is a bit different from consumer class HDDs so the pricing tends to be higher even if its an HDD While theres no denying the growth of SSDs in enterprise and Intels rapid ramp up of SSD revenue The enterprisefacing storage division needed to lower the cost even further perhaps into the GB range to be truly competitive HDDs are expected to decline in pricing at a sustained pace with a regression of around to the norm for the past couple years To leapfrog HDD SSDs need to reduce cost by to at a sustained pace Enterprise facing drives are more expensive than consumer drives so there will be a discrepancy in the cost comparisons Determining the intersection point of SSDs and HDDs is difficult Various industry forecasts sound overly optimistic on the pricing economics of HDDs and overly pessimistic on flashbased storage From what I understand Moores Law will likely sustain for the next years but its not yet clear what other new technologies will be developed to sustain HDD pricing If anything HDDs arent going to become a legacy technology until the timeframe so investors should be cautious of wildly optimistic forecasts on Intels storage revenue and somewhat cautious on bearish views when pertaining to conventional storage names like Seagate NASDAQ STX and Western Digital
