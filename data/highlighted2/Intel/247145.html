Alpha At the Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>pointed to key growth engines data center Internet of Things and nonvolatile memory However I expect growth in the data center and IoT areas to slow due to increased competition In its Investor Meeting presentations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC pointed to the Data Center Group DCG and Internet of Things Group ITG as engines of growth for the company For DCG especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has high expectations for of revenue growth in the midteens and operating income growth in low double digits However both groups are about to run afoul of formidable competitors in DCG will encounter new more powerful and efficient Power Architecture servers from IBM NYSE IBM Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM with its mature and cost effective communications processors will stymie Intels IoT ambitions Year to date performance of DCG has been strong with revenue up yy and operating income up yy CFO Stacy Smith presented Intels projections for DCG of revenue growth in the midteens and operating income growth in the low double digits Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sees no disruption of what is becoming an important profit center for the company In Q DCG was second only to the Client Computing Group NYSE CCG in revenue at billion vs billion for CCG and it was almost the equal of CCG in operating income at billion On Investor Day DCG was the star of the show being featured as the primary growth engine for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>With the exception of IBMs high end Z and Power servers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the server market to itself and DCG growth is effectively market limited Fortunately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>growth of Cloud Services has dramatically increased even as the traditional enterprise server business has leveled off The Investor Day presentation of Diane Bryant head of the Data Center Group highlighted the changing growth by enduser segment Although cloud computing is growing at a CAGR its not yet driving DCG growth at the same rate since other segments are growing more slowly and cloud is not yet at the point where it dominates DCG revenue Given Intels dominance of the server processor market it was to be expected that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would make a status quo projection for growth in Is there something that could disrupt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>DCG growth I think there is but its not the usual suspect Its not ARM As I pointed out in my article on Qualcomms ARM server <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to enjoy tremendous scale advantages compared to would be ARM server suppliers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can leverage the RD investments in the Client Computing Group by reusing CPU designs for its Xeon server processors The client business also provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with tremendous production scale Intels nm process regarded as the most advanced in the world was developed in large part with the support of the ongoing client business Most importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>enjoys market scale in that virtually all server software stacks are optimized to run on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>This creates tremendous inertia in favor of continuing to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the data center In another article I pointed out that a more potent threat will come from IBM in the form of its Power Architecture descended from PowerPC servers Diane Bryant acknowledged during her presentation that IBM was trying to move down market with its OpenPower initiative IBM created the OpenPower Foundation in order to encourage third parties to create Power Architecture processors servers and software Anandtech recently reviewed a Power server system and found it deficient both in terms of its Linux operating system and in power consumption I believe that IBM and the OpenPower Foundation will continue to mature the software stack The Power processor is fabricated on a nm nonFinFET process and would benefit from being moved to the SamsungGlobal Foundries nm FinFET process These developments can be expected some time in The time phasing for when more competitive Power Architecture systems hit the market is open to question but I believe that when they do they will have a disruptive effect on Intels DCG business Probably the first noticeable effect will be a decline in operating income as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cuts prices in order to preserve market share Although I believe that Qualcomm has little hope for its ARM server it stands a much better chance of competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the Internet of Things Qualcomm has pointed to IoT as a growth area to be pursued and in my view it is much better positioned than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt have the lock on IoT that it has on the data center According to ARMs Q earnings presentation ARM processors have more than of the market for Embedded Connectivity Basically this is an ARM embedded controller low cost low power combined with on chip modems for WiFi and cellular communications Qualcomm certainly has the communications part covered While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still working on developing its next gen standalone LTE modem Qualcomm already offers a higher performing X series modem combined with the Snapdragon system on chip SOC Qualcomm is one of the few ARM processor developers to successfully merge WiFi and cellular modems into its ARM SOCs Qualcomm can mix and match modems and processors to meet the needs of particular markets and customers In general by virtue of ARMs low cost and low power architecture its a much better match for IoT than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture Both companies want this very badly so I expect the fight to be protracted and bloody For I expect ITG revenue growth to slow and operating income to decline again as it is projected to do for I expect that Qualcomm will emerge victorious in the end but not unscathed My basic problem with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is its lack of adaptability besides its lack of candor Repeatedly we see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>trying to make its markets and customers adapt to the needs of the company rather than the other way around Intels mobile device strategy is more or less in ruins because of it Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes tablet and phone processors but nothing thats competitive with the best ARM devices And its not selling very many of them Intels lack of adaptability can be seen in the way it has coped with the paradigm shift away from commodity processors to the custom SOCs used by the industry leaders Apple NASDAQ AAPL Samsung OTCSSNLF and Huawei Being on the wrong side of the paradigm shift is still Intels biggest problem and its only going to get worse Intels reflexive response was to try to reassert the commodity model Thats what contra revenue was all about Contra revenue failed because the industry leaders had grown too large and powerful and because the new paradigm works so well Partly in response <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has fallen back on the Wintel partnership but this amounts to returning to its comfort zone in Windows PCs And theres probably no growth to be had there In servers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has unquestioned dominance but its unlikely to last IBMs OpenPower initiative is aimed squarely at commodity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>servers The other engine of growth in nonvolatile memory is unlikely to generate sufficient revenue growth to compensate for decreased growth in DCG and further declines in CCG And for thats basically whats in store for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>projected overall revenue growth in midsingle digits but this appears to assume continued growth of DCG in the projected midteens I consider it likely that Intels revenue will stagnate next year through a combination of slower than expected DCG growth and continued declines in CCG I consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a Sell Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US
