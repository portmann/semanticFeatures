long been a Good Enough effect leading to longer replacement cycles This Good Enough effect led to lower unit sales and also lower CPU shipments Now however a different kind of Good Enough effect might be appearing A more dangerous kind still And its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>thats bringing it on itself A long time ago I wrote an article on how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and others were exposed to the Good Enough effect This article When Good Enough Is Good Enough postulated that this effect would lead to ever longer replacement cycles Obviously longer replacement cycles lead to less units being sold per year other things being equal Good Enough thus referred to the fact that even an old PC could stay usable because its original specifications were enough to run most of the jobs the user requires Jobs like web browsing email watching video listening to music light use of spreadsheets word processing etc This effect was even made a bit worse by Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT improvement of the underlying OS This improvement came with Windows and now Windows all of which didnt increase and might even have reduced the necessary specifications to run them Put another way a PC that was able to run Windows Vista launched in January is still able to run Windows today For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>this also meant more or less that any CPU launched since the Core Duo from onward was able to stay running consumer workloads up until today This effect has been raging in the PC market for years and is certainly one culprit for the declining unit shipments that have been plaguing the PC market both in desktops and laptops Laptop sales were more resilient certainly on account of many factors including Better lighter and more performant designs more portability The laptop battery losing capacity over time and needing replacement inducing the replacement of the whole machine The increase in power efficiency which led both to lighter machines and longer durations on battery power However and this is the gist of this article yet another Good Enough effect is about to hit demand for CPUs and especially laptop CPU replacements This other problem is the reason I say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be its own worst enemy There is already an inkling of the problem in the way Chromebooks are enjoying some success though those are usually powered by ARMderived CPUs Chromebooks are usually less powerful than Intelpowered laptops However they still manage some success because theyre cheaper with a good part of that cheapness coming from said ARMderived CPUs Of course Chromebooks dont run Windows which somewhat limits their appeal at times A whole different article could also be written on how they have their own specific attractions but Ill leave that for another day But heres the thing There is a new class of laptops coming that do indeed run Windows And these laptops are comparable to Chromebooks in the sense that they are as cheap or cheaper These coming laptops run full Windows on account of using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips What are those chips I am talking about chips which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>designed mostly for tablets namely the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom X and X lines comprised of the Z Z and Z CPUs These launched without great fanfare during early but only now are they getting timid traction somewhat outside of their originallyintended target market The problem however is that this traction will probably increase greatly and will certainly be more reinforced still when these CPUs see their successors The betterknown use of this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU line would be in the Microsoft Surface originally priced at and carrying a X Z CPU If these new laptops I am talking about were being placed in the market at such prices though they wouldnt make much difference However something is brewing out of China One after the other unknown brands are putting together tablets and Tablet PCs using these <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs and running full Windows These tablets can easily be found for as low as and Tablet PCs based on the same type of specs can be and below As examples Source GearBestcom Chuwi Ultrabook Keyboard is actually a extra These are prices akin to what you find in lowend Android tablets or Chromebooks Yet they run Windows and in some cases instances have mostly display specs which rival laptops costing up to x as much Plus with these being based around a mobile logic they have their expandable storage based on microSD cards up to Gb which can be found for as low as Why am I writing about these forsaken brands nobody knows Because the overall specs of these machines are likely to be copied by betterknown brands And then these machines are getting Good Enough themselves this can for instance be seen if you compare an old <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core Due P from Q with these CPUs The P is entirely able to run Windows at a respectable pace I know I had an oldie Toshiba laptop running it The Core Duo P will have faster single core performance but only had cores For instance CPUBenchmark puts its singlethread rating at and its Average CPU Mark at The P did not have an integrated GPU The X Z cheapest among those CPUs I listed and common in the products above has cores CPUBenchmark puts its singlethread rating at just but then has its Average CPU Mark at not far from the P It also comes with integrated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphics GPU The X Z used in the Surface also has cores CPUBenchmark puts its singlethread rating at still lower than the P but then it has an Average CPU Mark of which is already significantly higher than the P It also comes with a slightly faster than the X Z integrated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphics GPU These performance figures explain why it can be used in the Surface without consumers puking on the device So whats the problem here Well these <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mobile CPUs prove themselves to be able to run full Windows at Good Enough levels Levels which could be sought by many consumers whose old laptops gave up the ghost or battery And the problem is as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>lists in its website that these CPUs carry recommended customer prices quantity tray of X Z X Z The Pentium U It carries a recommended customer price of Were not even talking about a lowend mobile i like the i U That has a recommended customer price of These prices change over time and are merely exemplifications True prices will be lower for all cases but theres no reason to believe the relative relationships dont hold See the problem Not only is the regular Good Enough a problem because PCs get replaced less often with laptops being saved some of it but this new type of Good Enough will And lead to diverting some many replacement sales which will carry CPUs costing th or less to rd of the alternative lowerend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offerings like the Celerons This hasnt hit yet because these machines which could be considered alternatives to other lowend laptops are only being offered by unknown brands However the proposition for a customer wanting to replace his year old machine for something with the same level of functionality since its Good Enough is clear With the proposition being clear its just a matter of time before similar machines are again offered by more mainstream better known brands I say again because there were previous attempts to launch such machines like the HP Pavillion X but these were based on the previous Atom generation which was still too weak to fulfill the role Indeed its already starting Heres an ASUS with specs very similar to those of the machines I listed above and at a price thats not much higher for a much betterlooking machine A recent Ashraf Eassa <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corps Next Atom Sees Significant Delay covered precisely the delay the next Atom generation codenamed Broxton was seeing Eassa puts it down to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>kind of giving up on the mobile phone market However one wonders if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>actually saw the damage to an even faster Atom could start doing to its own largecore higherpriced much highermargin bread and butter CPUs instead Seeing this it could have seen it fit to delay the reckoning Compounding the existing problem of Good Enough PCs lengthening replacement cycles and leading to lower unit sales now comes the problem of Intels mobile CPUs getting Good Enough to serve as alternatives to Intels traditional CPU line Obviously this problem mostly applies to consumer PCs which make up part of Intels Client Computing Group segment which represented of Intels revenues Still this problem might itself ultimately have as large or larger impact than the original Good Enough problem This is so because while replacement sales would still have an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU in them this CPU would be so much cheaper and lower margin that the ultimate outcome might exceed the impact from just selling fewer units on account of longer replacement cycles Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I
