components of Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM for the iPhone and iPhone s The modemwireless components costs more than the A processor Winning an LTE modem supply contract for iPhones is better than selling

from Apple to help it reduce its figure operating losses on mobile chipsproducts As a leader in smartphone evolution Apples move could also inspire other top vendors like Samsung OTC SSNLF Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY and LG Electronics OTC LGEAF to also use the more powerful XMM LTE modem Samsung and LG already used the older Cat XMM in some of their Android smartphones The Cat XMM Mbps download is x faster than the Cat Qualcomm MDMM LTE Mbps The new iPhone s iPhone s Plus and iPhone c might get unveiled this coming September I believe that Apple will likely use Intels LTE modems on cheaper handsets to attract more budgetconscious buyers in emerging markets like China and India The massive success of the iPhone and Plus created a Super Cycle that might hurt sales of the next highend iPhone models Sales of the iPhone tend to be cyclical Unfortunately the extreme sales number of the iPhone coupled with the relatively short period between the iPhone and s release is not conducive for people to replace their iPhone Even though the iPhone s will come with twice the RAM GB Force Touch and a stronger aluminum body majority of buyers in China and India are unlikely to replace their iPhone The highcost of the iPhone in markets outside the United States compels people to avoid replacing it just months after they bought it Since iPhone s is projected to get lower sales numbers than the iPhone Apple will try to make cheaper versions to attract buyers in priceconscious countries A cheaper iPhone c with cheaper <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modemswireless components could persuade Chinese buyers who previously could not afford the price tag of the iPhone I opine that Apple would use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE modems inside lowerASP iPhones China and India the top emerging countries will likely get Intelpowered iPhone s or iPhone c models Maintaining its market share in China is important for Apple because that country already contributes more than of iPhone sales The huge success of the iPhone meant that China sales have peaked and are already on a downtrend Only cheaper iPhones might help slow down the decline Cheaper handsets like the iPhone c could also help Apple increase its market share in India Apple is capable of selling million iPhones every year If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel

is also highly desirable INTC is a Buy The XMM LTE modem has a huge market in smartphones ABI Research estimates that global shipments of LTE handsets will increase from million units to million units
