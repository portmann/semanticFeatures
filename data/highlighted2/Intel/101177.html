</span>formed a joint venture with Micron not knowing that it might take more than years to build a truly competitive D NAND business After having developed cost disruptive memory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may be called on the remainder of its interest in IMFT Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might not be a storage player for much longer Microns recent partnership with Seagate and the vague commentary by Mark Durcan on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>partnership further substantiates my suspicion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron will go separate ways I dont know how to say this as constructively as possible without sounding alarmist in front of my readers But basically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU have this partnership in NAND flash and theres a buyout clause for this partnership that may favor Micron overwhelmingly Of course theres no telling if Micron will actually exercise the call that will start in But based on the language a call would imply that they have the right but not the obligation to buy back the remainder of the IMFT partnership interest in which they own of Some of the contributors on Seeking Alpha got into the gory details about how D NAND flash had immense upside potential and why Intels consumer CPU business has a supplementary sidekick in flash memory So even if worst comes to worst and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is unable to generate ramping CPU volume at least the ramp up in solid state storage devices would make up for the difference Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had signed away its right to own the NAND business for much longer Quoted from the Micron Annual Report page Since inception in through August we have owned of IMFT a venture between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and us to manufacture NAND Flash memory products and certain emerging memory technologies for the exclusive use of the members IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers and the number of managers appointed by each member to the board varies based on the members respective ownership interests which is based on cumulative contributions to IMFT The IMFT joint venture agreement extends through and includes certain buysell rights with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>put right commencing in January and our call right commencing in January pursuant to which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may elect to sell to us or we may elect to purchase from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Intels interest in IMFT If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>elects to sell to us we would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing of the purchase price from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for one to two years from the closing date I guess the real kicker is the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will give Micron the financing to buy back its interest in IMFT So instead of receiving a lump sum amount of cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will instead finance the sale of IMFT back to Micron if Micron elects to buy the remainder of its IMFT interest from onwards Upon launching the D NAND layers bit per cell the cost becomes disruptive Therefore the upside to investing into IMFT as a result of lower memory cost per GB is roughly when Micron will be able to take back a substantial ownership stake in IMFT So thats a huge problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors who were banking on this business partnership to be longterm accretive to earnings Theres the potential that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>no longer owns IMFT following So a forced sale for what could have been a star business could become a problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders On the most recent earnings conference call an analyst asked about Intels relationship with Micron Heres what Mark Durcan CEO of Micron stated Now relative to Microns and Intels plans for production theres not a whole lot I can say about that today other than to say it continues to be a very close partnership We continue to develop the D NAND technology together and we have existing longterm supply agreements with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to support planar NAND and we anticipate that we will build D NAND for them as well through an agreement out of Singapore And thats probably all I can say absent an agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to share more information with you So at this point were not even sure if Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue down this path as partners and with Micron also forming a partnership with Seagate NASDAQ STX its entirely plausible that Micron will exercise its right to buy back the remaining ownership interest in IMFT It will then go down a path where it supplies Seagate with flash memory products and develop NAND flash technology jointly with Seagate So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might not be a memory supplier for much longer folks Just have to break the bad news to you guys However they might create a new agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Just not sure if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will bite and while storage is a promising area Im curious to see how much Micron will have to pay in order to gain back the IMFT business At the current growth trajectory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will get a big lump sum of cash between and So its not bad But ideally I would have wanted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to own IMFT past Source IntelMicron Joint Venture Might Not
