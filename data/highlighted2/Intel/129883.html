serious about making a bid for the company News that the company was setting up a joint conference call with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC for tomorrow Tuesday had shares of Micron NASDAQ MU popping higher in early trading on Monday As you can see shares briefly popped early morning on Monday but have since recovered The rumor of a call tomorrow was on Microns IR site but has since been removed Well await further developments on the call but in the interim its a nice time to remind ourselves why Micron is a steal under Short sellers still seem to have their sights set on semiconductors Semiconductors are a step before finished technology goods so the performance of the chip sector is often held up a as a gauge of how the coming months will go for technology As you can see from this Wall Street article shorts have increased short bets in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AMD Qualcomm and MU over the last couple of months In addition to shorts piling on China isnt helping US semiconductors either Theyre funding plenty of Chinese companies to enter into the same market As part of that push we saw Tsinghuas reported bid for Micron this month Yahoo Finance writes Chip manufacturing is a space where China lags significantly According to the Wall Street Journal China spends billion every year to buy chips Among the leading semiconductor suppliers to China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Samsung Electronics OTC SSNLF top the list Tsinghuas latest offer to buy Micron Technology is a step forward in this strategic movement According to McKinsey estimates the Chinese government aims to provide trillion yuan in funding over the next five to ten years to uplift its native semiconductor companies It wants to enable acquisitions both at home and abroad in the semiconductor space Reason for concern Maybe But to us this is more of a series of indications that deals for Micron could remain competitive especially with the way the security is currently priced This mornings speculation over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>whether warranted or not also is not surprising to us We had stated in our last article about MU The companys billion market cap and continued partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would make it an obvious takeover candidate We think MU is a buy regardless of whether or not the Tsinghua deal holds up They may not be the answer but were confident that between PC demand picking up Microns low valuation and the activists in the company an answer is on its way At the time of our last article we didnt even know if the Tsinghua bid was going to be considered as a real bid Since then Tsinghua has reiterated that theyre serious about the offer which was dismissed by Micron Tomorrows rumored call with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may be nothing more than an update on the two companies NAND partnership But it caused the market a stir today for a reason people believe that Micron is cheap enough for someone to just pick it up tomorrow As weve said in the past you dont need to be a financial heavyweight or have someone knocking at the door to understand that MUs valuation is attractive At x sales and x book Micron is undervalued any way you look at it even in a sector where growth may be slowing The companys x EVEBITDA makes Micron an extremely attractive candidate for a takeover In addition to the showing demand for MU now we still think that Windows will provide a needed boost for the PC market despite numerous pundits predicting it wont Weve had a chance to use it and we think it could be the long awaited answer from Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT that once again creates demand Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MU over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses
