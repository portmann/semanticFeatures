again We think that underlying business could actually see an inflection in end demand growth numbers in Q which will drive Qualcomms results Before that though Qualcomm revenues have the chance to surprise as they resign customers that stopped paying after the Chinese government accused them of antitrust Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has gone through a period of multiple issues which has dragged results and the stock price We think over the next year those issues can turn into drivers As those drivers take hold in combination with lapping weak results Qualcomm could begin to show an inflection point in revenue growth We believe that is the key driver to cause investors to need to own Qualcomm a market leader again We will review each step of why the stock has become out of favor and the drivers that we believe will sway back fundamentals and investors Apple NASDAQ AAPL Revenues Slowing We know that Apple revenues have been slowing Apple made up of Qualcomm revenues in K As Apples revenues have slowed Qualcomm has had a slowing impact on their sellin to Apple Below is the quarterly trend of Apple revenues IDC has said that Q global smartphone growth slowed to which was down from growth in down from in Of which Qualcomm has by far the largest market share of G and G chip technology As goes the market so goes Qualcomm Qualcomm with the market has also seen its revenues slow and go negative China began investigating anticompetitive claims at the turn of Those claims materially slowed business for Qualcomm Even though Qualcomm continued to sell in to clients they had difficulty collecting or knowing if they were going to collect The stock price peaked soon after as the case weighed on investor sentiment and business trends The case was resolved in February but Qualcomm continued to have difficulty collecting from customers in China In many cases when they collected on a sale they did not book them to revenues because they did not know what the outcome of the enforcement would be As for revenues revenues started to go negative yearoveryear in the June quarter of You can see in the chart above that is when the stock started to accelerate on the downside This is also why we believe that positive revenue growth will help repair the stock price There may be a new driver to market share in Asia taking share from Apple Apple owns the premium segment but the fastest growth in Asia is coming from lower priced smartphone devices While the overall market has been slowing lowend device makers have been growing According to Qualcomm they actually have less content per unit when selling in to Apple than they do in other vendors Because of that Qualcomm can begin to grow again As lowend vendors take share the mix of customers that have a higher content per phone of Qualcomm chips increases Samsung Huawei and OPPO all have phones that sell in Asia for about half the price of Apple While the overall market is seeing growth slow in the right column the lower end players are taking share Look at their year over year change versus the market Even Samsung with growth is taking share from Apple That means Qualcomms content is gaining share because they generally will have more content per unit of players outside of Apple The chart above also shows lower end players gaining share As has been reported see Mark Hibbens Report after the Mobile World Congress In Barcelona Qualcomm has been a big winner at multiple vendors outside of Apple Qualcomm has wins from many of the vendors listed above We think they will continuously win especially after a strong showing earlier this year at Mobile World Congress We think the huge demand for performance driven by huge data demand growth will force vendors to have to go with bestinclass chip performance Step s conclusion Apples pain is Qualcomms gain in a way Apple slowing still hurts but when growth rates at the low end overtake premium declines the overall market will grow and content per device can increase for Qualcomm The overall market could pick up as well We will hit an inflection point when premium phones that are slowing will be overtaken by low end growth as they take over market share numbers We think we need to lap this years strong Apple comparisons before that happens When we finally lap Apples huge numbers in Asia from last year the slowdown of the premium market will ease its influence on the overall market slowdown That will happen after the September quarter or months away you see in the chart above that the last difficult comparisons are in September The excercise to see revenues grow is part qualitative low end picking up share and part numeric that premium declines will stop being a drag on overall share soon Stock prices discount in advance but we already have visibility that the share shifts from premium to low end are in effect which has slowed the overall market That overall market slowdown will end we believe after these comparisons are lapped That will give an upward bias to overall growth led by the lowend growth numbers We also think that Q numbers may have been held back by the economic and stock market downside in Asia in Q Now that markets have stopped going down consumer confidence may have normalized somewhat Qualcomm said that they only collected from of their customers in China in They said they expected to have that number reach this year That said they did not include that in their forecasts China made up of their overall revenues K The company guided to B B of revenues for next quarter The street is at B That said the company expects that of that will come on to revenues just by collecting from customers already purchasing their chips That is additional revenue growth this year to the overall revenue base Add to that as they bring these customers back as paying customers they will account for past revenues that they either received and did not book because of the lack of clarity if they would be allowed to keep those revenues or revenues that they did not collect at all as customers used the excuse of government action not to pay Customers either owe them money or Qualcomm did not book cash as revenues holding back results As these customers sign back on there will be current revenues received and catchup revenues booked that will drive earnings You can start to see the path to growing revenues again Keep in mind the high end of Qualcomms revenue range actually already calls for revenue growth which may be upside to our thesis We begin to lap last years slower numbers just as we are going to start to collect from customers that are already purchasing chips As we get deeper into the easier comparisons in combination with increased collections revenues have the ability based on that alone to start to go positive in Q Add to that what we said about shareshifts to the low end helping end market demand in Q which they will book in Q there is a lag in some of their recognition We have three meaningful drivers to revenues coming in about two quarters comparisons collections share shifts Short interest is not high but it has jumped of late up The stock has traded off after earnings in each quarter over the last two years Add to that it is off of its high It is fair to say sentiment likely has room for upside Qualcomms PE of late was x Before it averaged x or more The street is expecting for Fiscal September We ran some numbers and it is not hard to get above that if some of the items we mentioned above go well That means that x can get you up to or upside That said of SA readers are looking ahead If you vote you can see the overall sentiment of SA readers The company has missed guided down and disappointed many times over the last two years You need to be ready for that You need to be prepared for the stock disapointing on earnings and looking passed that to a future pick up Analysts on last earnings call were annoyed with management that they were not flowing through to guidance the extra collection revenues in China Analysts thought it was conservative The company claims that it is reasonable given the difficulty they have had to date of collections and they dont want to expect too much If collections continue to be a problem revenues may be stuck in the mud The overall market can continue its descent to lower negative numbers We showed the immense slowdown in overall growth Even if the low end wins share if the market descends to negative numbers the low end growth will not help Qualcomm get back to growth There is huge competition for chipset makers to win devices Qualcomm has been up against their own customers as well as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and other huge names to hold and gain share This can change at any moment That said we think that Qualcomm seems to be showing important design win momentum and we think that will be a shield nearterm Review of the stair steps to revenue growth the key ingredient for stock performance Low end taking share where Qualcomm has more content per device Low end revenue growth overtaking premium revenue declines Larger content per device of the market share winners less content per device of market share losers Make up revenues and booking older revenues from large customers that are already buying after settling antitrust issues Q economic bounce back in Asia and the world Holiday period reemergence of overall growth led by low end and easier comparisons Overall g and g growth from legacy g in emerging markets India and rest of Asia driving growth next year There are plenty of drivers that are stacking up including easy comparisons share shifts and China payment collections that can help Qualcomms revenues go positive again There are plenty of risks and Qualcomm has disappointed Wall Street for two years straight so this is not an easy journey That said given likely bearish sentiment if this market leader can get back on track we think everybody will need to own Qualcomm again Elazar Advisors LLC regularly speaks with corporate management teams and specializes in earnings and predicts analyzes and reacts to earnings
