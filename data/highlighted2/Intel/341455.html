class='textDiv'>Tier Smartphone Ramp For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha It has been reported months ago that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was trying to win the modem design for the iPhone using more than engineers and researchers It looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>won of the modem production for iPhone probably for emerging markets At this point those engineers are very likely also working on providing the A design at nm for the iPhone S The iPhone modem production would imply billion in revenues while the AP production would imply additional multiple billions Back in November it was reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC may be working to win some modem design and production for the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone series and that it may also be working on the future AA SoCs In another rumor it was reported that the company was working on the LG OTCLGEAF Nuclun which points at the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making tests for the application processor AP market But things have changed recently putting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in a different and really a better position as regards the mobile hardware market modem application processors and WiFiBT maybe while Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM is under threat It has been reported that the company has probably won the of the next iPhone modem production mainly for those markets where CDMA is not required It is possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modems could also be supplied for the upcoming iPhone SE even though it would be quite difficult due to the timing but not impossible But which modem is it Considering that people are working on this modem it is very difficult to see a simple XMM inside future iPhones since it is already commercialized and is designed at nm meaning that it would have a great disadvantage against the Qualcomm counterpart As regards the speed concerns the declared speeds are not achievable by any carrier which means that it is not the main discriminating factor It would make a lot more sense to have an updated XMM or XMM X An updated XMM would have to be redesigned to be built with a nm node while CDMA adoption would be possible through the CDMA acquisition at the end of but this would essentially be an XMM X The XMM X was reported to sample during H ramping up in Q However Apple has already managed to obtain hardware anticipations andor temporary exclusives from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the past In addition the fact that the supply is only for of the future iPhone means that the overall volume is about million modems not the entire million volume Finally the XMM X is already set to implement CDMA support The XMM at nm may still make sense if it is confined to the iPhone SE but considering that this smartphone is likely to mount the A SoC nm the adoption of a nm modem still doesnt make so much sense while the previous two Qualcomm modems were built using nm node Besides the iPhone SE is rumored to be released this month making the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem adoption quite difficult The modem design win may also translate into additional business related to the future iPhone S which is set for release in late Taking for granted that the A will be produced by TSMC NYSE TSM the A remains an open challenge TSMC earthquake issues may push Apple to defer its production another time Samsungs OTCSSNLF plan to improve its foundry scalability may leave a margin for a price per unit reduction in relation to an eventual Apple supply Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already won part of the iPhone modem production a future production of A by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would make sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs massive tier smartphone production in order to become a first mobile market player and therefore good prices are possible but forget contra revenues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm is denser than Samsung or TSMC The same goes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm which is much denser than Samsung or TSMC nm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm production is set for in perfect time for the A SoC In a combo order with both A and modem would likely drive down the price per unit through scalability As a modem supplier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is sensible because Apple is targeting to integrate the modem in future SoCs Thus using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>foundries to integrate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modems inside Apple SoCs is quite logical and efficient In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may also infiltrate another Apple supply market the WiFiBT combo chip and the relative power management chip The company is already working on switching its chip production towards the nm node so a combo chip joint with the XMM modem could be a feasible solution Maybe it wont make it for the iPhone but the iPhone S or Pro will likely be the right device to see a WiFiBT combo chip from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>As I have already shown in the past Intels overall picture is a larger one The company is working with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT on the future Surface Phone which will probably be a topend device SoFIA will switch to nm with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>foundries and it will hit not only the lowend market but also the midend These SoCs are also related to the IoT market and the VR market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is reported to be working on a personalized VR while it supplies SoCs for Microsoft Holo Lens D Xpoint may be suitable to join <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoCs in the near future The scenario is very wide and the company is improving and preparing different approaches to strike both the lowmidmarket and the highend market CLSA states that modem supply will bring of revenues and earnings to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>while Qualcomm will lose of revenues and of its earnings For what concerns <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>of revenue would translate into million but if the company able to sell even its WiFiBT combo chip and the relative power management module the revenues would increase by or million And what if Apple entrusts the A production to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>If we consider a supply of the of actual iPhone sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would generate revenues for an overall or million Obviously if the entire production was entrusted to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the overall revenue increase would go beyond or billion Such an increase driven by a sole customer in the mobile sector would be great for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which is still struggling in the mobile market On the other hand Qualcomm would be hit seeing its revenue market crash by depending on which kind of deal Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will make in the months and years to come TSMC would face a similar fate since it produces all the Qualcomm products used by Apple It is quite peculiar how a single product given the specific situation may trigger a lot of market changes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is posed to surge in the mobile market but it all depends on its capacity of winning some design for a tier smartphone If the company able to do it the lowmidend strategy SoFIA will be a great help in infiltrating every end market Disclosure Iwe have no
