#A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might be the most important company in the world The nm pushout is a juke move by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is composed of two primary businesses the Client Computing business PCs and the Data Center business server chips All other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>businesses if combined would be in bankruptcy Critics of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>point out that the client computing segment is declining and seem to imply that the end point is zero In fact the client computing business is about billion in revenue sporting a gross margin The client computing business has as Jack Rivkin says made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the most important company in the world PCs have funded Moores Law at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for years Moores Law in turn has driven progress in all its forms in the semiconductor business Without the manic progress of Moores Law the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone would not be possible as well as most other high technology gadgets Personal computing has stimulated the growth of the Internet data traffic which in turn made high performance servers PC chips on steroids necessary hence the second major <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>business the Data Center Business This is a billion gross margin rapidly growing business supplying an array of unbelievably complex and high performance computer processing chips to support all the data generated by the fruits of Moores Law everywhere <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is further criticized for missing the mobile business opportunity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>certainly did miss the shift from simple cell phones to the much more complex smartphones in use today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at the time was dealing with very high and increasing complexity in microprocessors for client and server applications while the cell phone industry was increasing complexity from a very low level to levels that could support todays smart functions That these two efforts didnt connect is very understandable So the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>we see today is made up of billion worth of incredibly profitable business and billion of small or unprofitable businesses How does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>double its revenue from here As I see it there are only two semiconductor businesses of sufficient scale and process sophistication to be of interest to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>One is the storage business and the other is the missed mobile business The IntelMicron NASDAQ MU joint venture in nonvolatile memory has produced what appears to be an impressive solution to D NAND memory to be used in solid state drives SSD The NAND based SSD opportunity is said to be a billion business thats only penetrated at this point Samsung OTCSSNLF is the first supplier to enter production on D NAND and has been ramping production for the past year Recent industry whispers would indicate that Samsung is having difficulties with their approach to D NAND The highest density device available from Samsung is a Gb TLC part while the first device from IntelMicron will be a Gb chip three times the Samsung capacity In answer to a question during the recent earnings conference call no less than the CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Brian Krzanich said But what we have said is that D NAND especially with the architectural choices that Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chose we believe gives a significant cost and performance advantage over their competitors and those specifics are holding as we go through the ramp process If Samsung is in trouble with D NAND and with Hynix and SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK both claim to be using charge trap approaches nowhere in sight for production of D NAND <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron could divide the billion SSD business that promises to develop over the next years Picking through a variety of documents and the great SA article by Stephen Breezy on recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>patent applications we can see that the IntelMicron joint venture is getting ready to launch new nonvolatile memory You might wonder Why a new NV memory when you have this wonderful D NAND beginning a production ramp The answer is that this nonvolatile memory is actually a Random Access Memory RAM This is expected to be a replacement for both onchip cache SRAM and system DRAM A comment in Breezys article points out that the proposed Phase Change Memoryw Switch PCMS is significantly cheap and denser than DRAM If PCMS is cheaper and denser than DRAM it will be much much cheaper and denser than SRAM which now takes up over half of the silicon area in state of the art mobile SoCs NV RAM used in mobile application processors and as a replacement for DRAM system memory will allow much lower power levels and associated longer battery life in any mobile device Process node is no longer as important for mobile devices as it was nodes ago Its all about power consumption now and of course package heat might ask Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM about that So NV RAM used in mobile devices is the compelling feature that could get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>virtually all the mobile chip business as new designs replace old designs The mobile business of interest to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the AP LTE chip and the DRAM that would become PCMS A very rough estimate of the total mobile business of interest for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be as high as billion I view this a maddening juke by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for the foundries that are trapped into spending like drunken sailors As the lithography nodes get more difficult and expensive it really makes sense to run the nodes longer over three chips rather than two chips per node If Moores observation is basically about cheaper transistors there may be better ways to get the desired density and cost D NAND for memory is a good example In D NAND the lithography is relaxed while the vertical direction is exploited As a little side note here in order to exploit the vertical direction etching technology becomes more important than lithography technology High aspect ratio etching is very difficult to do with perfectly straight sides Finfet technology requires mastery of etching technology You can see the progress made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>from first generation finfet to second generation finfet The fins in the first generation were trapezoidal in the second generation the fin sides have almost no slope It seems that progress in finfet etching leads to progress in etching the D structures in the new NAND process There is already a vertical layer increase and a lithographic shrink in the roadmap for the IntelMicron D NAND At the end of those advances years the original Gb chip will become Gb chip or the equivalent of a GB single chip SSD I find that amazing In the example above the new NV RAM memory cell will be as effective in reducing cost as a traditional lithographic shrink would be A significant reduction in power also will come with that new memory cell So a dash to nm is no longer necessary or even desirable For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a new tick tock tock cycle will reduce capex and associated depreciation by about a third The part of RD that is expensed capital purchases should also decline by a third Both of these enable more of that gross profit to appear at the bottom line Moores Law can live on as advances in exotic materials or mastery of D technology As the cost of design for complex custom chips at the bleeding edge of technology increases field programmable technology makes more sense than ever before Moving the design load to the customer improves cost and time to market while allowing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to produce a small number of high function and high quality FPGA SKUs Since the interconnect fabric of FPGAs has always been SRAM I think we will see some effort to replace those SRAM cells with PCMS cells discussed above The FPGAs would become nonvolatile much smaller and still retain their ability to be reprogrammed or programmed on the fly Again from Brian Krzanich during the earnings conference call Finally integrating Alteras worldclass technology with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture in the highgrowth data center and Internet of Things market segments will create new product categories and capabilities Now where did that come from IoT parts will be of limited capability can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>be thinking of including a section of FPGA in these simple cheap parts in order to transfer the design load to the customer and allowing for some serious custom design of low volume IoT devices What if these sections were to use the PCMS memory cells as the FPGA interconnect fabric The result will be tiny cheap power sipping chips of amazing flexibility and capability with surprisingly high gross margin to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Maybe all this is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is willing to pay an absolute ton of money for Altera If FPGA blocks appear in nearly everything that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes the buy price for the company might look very reasonable in a few years Chinas Tsinghau Unigroup is reputed to have made a share offer to buy Micron As a joint venture partner with Micron in some very important emerging memory technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would have a keen interest in how this comes out It is hard to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would want China as a partner in this technology However the fact is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>actually invested billion into Unigroup last year Uncle Sam might have an opinion on a China takeover of the only remaining western hemisphere memory manufacturer Obviously Micron shareholders will have to vote on any takeover Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the only entity outside of Micron to know what is going on in the JV they might choose to make an th hour offer to buy Micron in a stock swap If the D NAND and NV RAM are as important as I think they are no price would be too high to pay for Micron There are a lot of moving parts in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>right now There is a cluster of meetings and presentations happening during the month of August that simply must flesh out information on the new memory initiatives While Micron would be a buy for many reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will wind up the end beneficiary of any of these new technologies and is therefore a strong buy at these low levels Source How <span
