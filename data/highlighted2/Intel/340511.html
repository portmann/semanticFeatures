style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>RealSense image processing combined with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>freeD video modeling will create a new billion business for the company by in the autonomous IoT arena RealSense image processing models movement in D freeD combines multiple numerous video feeds into one video model Combined these two technologies will disrupt technology associated with autonomous device movement by predicting object movement outside the view of any one object Gartner estimates that by there will be some billion connected devices IDC is even more bullish and expects there to be about billion connected devices by Many of these devices will have just a few sensors and little need to compute There is still profit to be made in the small IoT devices with little need to compute However profits will be much greater associated with the IoT devices that move autonomously My previous article focused on the part of the IoT market that will require the greatest amount of compute power and collect the most data the next big things Autonomous devices require many sensors and the ability to see and compute They also will collect the most data from video streams as the autonomous devices move around on their own Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is most likely to earn the most profit from the Autonomous IoT platform both in the field end and in the data center end The company is building an autonomous device platform from end to end As part of this platform it is providing the RealSense silicon and algorithms needed to see interpret collect and make decisions based on D image processing what is around the autonomous device At the other end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is providing the compute power in the data center to analyze the huge amount of data that will be collected by D image processing devices moving around autonomously An example of this is its basketball court data processing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>takes video from or more cameras around the basketball court and weaves all of these images together to create a reallife D video model of the action on the court From this model the company can create new dynamic video views of the imagery using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>freeD Think of it as taking the complete volume of any arena and breaking it down in to a collection of small cubes Once you have that complete set of voxels you can use a large computer to put yourself anywhere on the court or the field and view degrees around you Imagine being able to witness a slam dunk from the defenders perspective or the defensive rush from the quarterbacks perspective Amazing right Well thats what well see this weekend at the AllStar slam dunk contest and during the NBA AllStar Game Well see the slam dunks blocks and steals from every angle every position This D video modeling is done with normal video cameras It is also done as a replay Now take this concept several steps further and use D image processing data from D cameras like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>RealSense in real time Now imagine a bunch of autonomous devices including cars augmented reality NYSE AR empowered smartglasses and drones all contributing D image processing data to an overall truly D freeD model from various perspectives We then could have a realtime D model of the movements of everything in an area and even things that are approaching the area This model would have the ability to predict movements of things within this D video model Having this D modeling available in realtime woven together from multiple perspectives would truly be disruptive and be a huge leap forward in collision avoidance autonomous movement Who else besides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in position to deliver such a D freeD system in real time The company is is in position to deliver this system from end to end from the RealSense image processors moving around on devices to the hubs that collect and process this data to the data centers that analyze the yottabytes of Big Data collected by Dimaging RealSense devices Yes the Star Wars character Yoda is a homophone for yotta and is a cousin of Google also a number Yotta is the largest decimal unit prefix in the metric system One yottabyte is one trillion terabytes and times a zettabyte Further connections at the hub level will allow autonomous devices to share data associated with reactive movements in order to avoid collisions For example if two smart autonomous objects are about to collide the sharing of information can make sure that both objects do not try to avoid collision by moving to the same spot colliding in an effort to avoid collision The G work that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing with many other companies as well as the drone work that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing with ATT will help build the IP and communication system needed for D freeD autonomous collision avoidance This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IoT shared IP pyramid helps to explain the high profit potential for Intels RealSenseempowered freeD modeling in real time in the real world IoT devices that are not autonomous will be more likely at the bottom of this pyramid in the range Autonomous devices will more likely be in the range These higherend devices will be less of a commodity than the bottom end of IoT devices These autonomous devices while lower in number will have contribute much greater profit levels due to the limited competition for these extremely complex devices that require super highspeed connections from the field device to the hub to the data center and back again Lets say that half of the vehicles AR smart glasses robots and drones have this advanced imagery processing ability That is half of million per year or million devices a year At each for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that is a new billion a year business by Dont hold your breath for this one or run out and buy INTC stock based on this huge opportunity In the short term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to struggle as it invests in the companys future and diversifies outside of PCs This future will likely include an endtoend platform for D freeD image processing from multiple moving and autonomous devices for collision avoidance I am watching for investment opportunities in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The stock is likely to drop back to a share this year before rising on the back of new tech advancements In the near term I will be looking for signs that the company is being successful in turning around the PC market rapidly growing data center sales expanding IoT and growing its new memory business Maybe these signs will start to show up in More likely we will need to wait until the second half of for these signs to be more obvious and secure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the middle of a longterm effort to make itself more relevant in new tech innovation and application I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
