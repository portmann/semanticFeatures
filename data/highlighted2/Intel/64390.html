Secretary who will take you through the formalities of the meeting Thanks Andy On April nd we began to distribute our meeting notice and the Proxy Statement and March rd was our record date for the voting of approximately billion shares outstanding at that time Approximately of those shares are present in person or by proxy at this meeting This is the majority of the shares outstanding which is a necessary quorum for the meeting If you have already voted as Andy said you dont need to do anything further If you want to change your vote or have not yet voted you can do so with the representative of our voting tabular forum who is in the back of the room Jim Alden ph from American Election Services will be serving today as our Inspector of Elections The polls close at am so all

todays presentations including Brian Krzanichs business update contain forwardlooking statements All statements made during the annual meeting that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially Please refer to our recent Q earnings release our Form K and most recent Form Q for more information on the risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ If we use any nonGAAP financial measures during the presentations you will find on our website intccom the required reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures And a remarkable reading that was I was sure that the audience was going to break into applause when you finished On behalf of the Board I would like to thank the stockholders who returned their proxies and are here to vote in person We have eight items to deal with today Our first proposal today is election of directors I would now like to introduce the nominees I will ask you to stand and remain standing until all have been introduced and of course hold your applause so then we dont want the meeting interrupted by constant applause First Brian Krzanich CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Next Charlene Barshefsky Senior International Partner at the Law Firm of Wilmer Hale On the phone is Aneel Bhusri who is Cofounder and CEO of Workday Susan Decker that was Aneel Susan Decker Principal of Deck Ventures also attending by phone John Donahoe President and CEO of eBay Jim Plummer Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University Dave Pottruck Chairman and CEO of Red Eagle Ventures and Frank Yeary Executive Chairman of CamberView Partners and me Andy Bryant the Chairman of the Board And with that you all may be seated So Ive begged and got your applause The other nominees Reed Hundt and David Yoffie were unable to attend the meeting today There were no other nominations submitted in accord with the bylaw requirements and nominations are now closed The second matter today is ratification of the selection of Ernst Young as our Intels independent auditors for I would like to introduce the two partners here and ask you stand as well Geoff Lang and Matt Sapp ph from Ernst Young Our third item on agenda will be an advisory vote to prove executive compensation We are asking stockholders to prove on an advisory basis the compensation of Intels listed officers as described in detail in the proxy statement We have a long history of strong payforperformance alignment and we believe that our compensation programs operate in the best interest of our stockholders While this is an advisory vote the Comp Committee and the Board take it seriously if issues arise through the vote that will certainly research those issues to directly better understand any concerns of the stockholders and take appropriate action The next item is the amendment and extension of the Equity Plan This is the plan we use to grant stock options and restricted stocks to employees Our policy is to present the plan every two years for approval by the shareholders the stockholders so that they can actually see how were using the plan on a fairly frequent basis Next item will be the extension of the Stock Purchase Plan This is a plan we use to give employees the opportunity to acquire stock through periodic payroll deduction apply towards the purchase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>common stock at a discount The primarily purpose of this plan is to provide employees with the opportunity to acquire ownership stake in the Company We present this plan for approval every five years so that again the stockholder could see how were using the plan The final agenda items today are votes on three stockholder proposals The first stockholder proposal was submitted by Mr Harrington and his representative Father McManus will be presenting the proposal Is Father McManus here Please step forward to the microphone and wed like to offer you five minutes to present your proposal Good morning Mr Chairman and all here I rise to move the resolution on the Holy Land Principles The Holy Land Principles are proJewish proPalestinian and proCompany The principles do not call for quotas reverse discrimination divestment disinvestment or boycotts The principles do not take any position on solutions to the IsraeliPalestinian issue The principles do not try to tell the Palestinians or the Israelis what to do The Holy Land Principles only call for fair employment by American companies in PalestineIsrael who could even begin to argue against that Irrespective of what Americans think about the PalestinianIsraeli issue one thing is certain all Americans expect American companies in the Holy Land to practice fair employment Our resolution calls on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to set the standard by signing and implementing the Holy Land Principles which are best on the very effective MacBride Principles for Northern Ireland Initially American companies doing business in Northern Ireland resisted signing the MacBride Principles but now American companies doing business in Northern Ireland eventually saw the light and signed the principles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>tried to get the SEC to exclude this resolution naughtynaughty but the SEC in its great wisdom and profound knowledge ruled against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and in favor of the Little Holy Land Principles So that tells everyone the world over that the Holy Land Principles therefore are intrinsically valid inherently fair and reasonable and in the best American tradition This is a historic moment and that it is the third time ever that an American company is voting for the Holy Land Principles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should sign the Holy Land Principles that is the American way God bless America Thank you It will be So called progressives have really been in action for the proxy season right thinking shareholder proposals were submitted dealing with environment political activity and human rights Proxy Preview a group who tracks this stuff calls Father McManuss proposal a human rights proposal It is not The proposal is a polemic and not a serious attempt to cure any evils on the part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management We know this right off because the authors choose to call the land in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>operates PalestineIsrael The Romans in defeating the Jews in AD renamed the land Palaestinia When I was a boy I made donations at a time to Jews of Palestine But in the nation of Israel came into being This proposal attempts to change the name of Israel back to Roman times as if the Queen of England decided to bring the name of the state of Maine back to its th century name Massachusetts Itll never happen If you read this proposal carefully and related items on the web you will see the proposal for what it is an antiSemitic screed against the Jews of Israel and an argument against their continued survival Good morning I am here like I live in this county Welcome Father McManus I will speak against the proposal I invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation because of its activities in Israel I was so impressed by that IntelIsrael its good for the corporation its good for Israel its good for the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has an exemplary exemplary human rights policy for which I commend the leadership of this corporation and its development I looked at the HLP the Holy Land Principles in detail I read the pamphlet over and over I was shocked by the omissions in the principles Yes its a good thing to say there should be no discrimination on basis of national religious ethnic origins But theres nothing about gender theres nothing about sexual orientation theres nothing about disability in these eight principles In other words one if I were being snippy I might ask does that mean that the HLP thinks its okay to discriminate against people in Israel or anywhere else on the basis of gender for being a woman for being LGBT for being disable for being pregnant But if you read that those proposals that would be a logical conclusion I dont understand why those are admitted Intels principles at governance operation in Israel are times better than the HLP Im sorry to say And so I understand the by reading carefully the language that the HLP is anything but neutral and unbiased And reading the language the weakweak language youll understand that But Im going to ask that we reject these on the basis that its a shockingly inadequate set of principles that allow discrimination that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would never allow on its own Thank you Thank you for your comments And thank you Father McManus for describing the proposal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recognizes and the board recognizes that the importance of equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees Im proud to say that Intels policy and practice in Israel and around the world meet the tenets of the Holy Land Principles We believe that adding staff and compliance process for principles to which we already comply to be redundant and unnecessary cost as well For that reason we recommend against the stockholder proposal as well The next item is a stockholder proposal submitted by Mr Chevedden Is Mr Chevedden or representative here today Please step to the microphone we would like to offer you five minutes to introduce your proposal as well and can you please state your name for us Good morning my name is Barbara Flaherty ph and I stand on behalf of John Chevedden to move proposal number seven Independent Board Chairman Shareholders request that our Board of Directors adopt a policy that the Chairman of our Board of Directors shall be an Independent Director who is not a current or former employee of the company and whose only nontrivial professional familial or financial connection to the company or its CEO is the directorship The policy should be implemented so as not to violate existing agreements and should allow for departure under extraordinary circumstances such as the unexpected resignation of the chair Shareholders are best served by any independent Board chair who can provide a balance of power between the CEO and the Board empowering strong Board leadership The primary duty of a Board of Directors is to oversee the management of a company on behalf of shareholders A combined CEO chair creates a potential conflict of interest resulting in excessive management influence on the Board and weaker oversight of the management Many companies already have an independent chairman An independent chairman is a prevailing practice in the United Kingdom and many international markets This proposal topic won plus support at five major US companies in including support at Netflix Please vote to enhance shareholder value both for Independent Board Chairman proposal number Thank you Thank you Ms Flaherty Ph The Boards general policy based on experience is that the positions of Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer should be held by separate persons And as an aid to the Boards oversight of management if the chairman is not an independent director the Board appoints a lead director to serve as the independent lead director The independent directors are a significant majority of the Board currently of directors and the Boards policy allows the independent directors to implement the Boards leadership structure that they believe is best suited for the Board at any particular time The Board believes that its existing policies empower the independent directors to act independently of management and better serve our stockholders than the inflexible rule requested in this proposal For these reasons we recommend stockholders vote against the proposal The last agenda item today is submitted a stockholder proposal submitted by Mr Rehm and Ms Geary They have appointed Ms Larry Ph as their representative standing in front of the mike at the moment so I dont need to ask her she is here Please take five minutes to describe this proposal Thank you I stand on behalf of Investor Voice of Seattle to move proposal number which calls for simple majority voting Currently a number of corporations like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>choose to use two different voting formulas when tallying votes at their annual meetings This simple majority proposal seeks to remove abstentions from the formula and to harmonize how our company counts and reports votes results to the SEC its stockholders and the press <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already uses a simple majority formula for director elections So it should be neither cumbersome nor difficult to adopt simple majority at the uniform standard across the board A recent white paper study the impact of counting abstentions It examined voting in the SP and Russell over years Weve evaluated more than individual votes The Wall Street Journal published an Exclusive on this research and Corporate Secretary magazine named a simple majority issue in Must Read for Executives One key finding among many rather than having a neutral effect counting abstentions creates times greater negative impact on shareholder proposals than on management terms The studys findings correlate to make it clear that when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>pushes abstentions into its formula the result is not neutral and all items are not treated equally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders deserve a harmonized fair and consisted voting system not a twocount system that creates multiple outcomes advantages Boards elections skews other vote and disproportionately harms shareholders Three points in closing Number one from data provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>of the Companys own peer group already use the simple majority standard and of the SP and Russell do as well which makes this a reasonable and mainstream request Number two a third of companies receiving this proposal have adopted simple majority to enhance their governance all these are from SP and half are Delaware chartered like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Number three simple math shows the counting abstention skews votes and research now provides conclusive evidence that it also inordinately harms shareholders Shareholders deserve accurate equitable and consistent vote counting And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should match the governance standards set by of its peers Therefore please vote for proposal number Thank you very much Thank you The board certainly recognizes the importance of good governance and we have evaluated this topic and have not found any indication that the vote counting standard requested in this proposal is viewed as a corporate governance best practice or otherwise as an emerging trend We view the proposed changes unnecessary and contrary to the best interests of our stockholders The vote counting standard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>currently applies to both company and stockholder proposals other than election of directors as required by law acknowledges and gives effect to stockholders affirmative action to abstain on a specific matter and is the standard applied by most large public companies incorporated in Delaware For these reasons we recommend against the proposal The next order of business will be the CEO report But before we get to that I would like to take a moment to thank Cary Klafter Cary please stand Cary recently stepped down as Corporate Secretary plans to retire from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>later this summer He has presided over annual meetings and we thank him for his service Thank you Andy Good morning everybody Its good to see everybody here this morning I thought I would give just start with a summary of and give you a picture of how I saw the companys performance and then will spend a little bit of time on as well and just talk about what are our objectives and what do we see as our imperative So lets start with just a quick look at We really look at as a strong year when we really performed well and our technologies really came into its full maturity For there was a total shareholder return This is including stock appreciation plus dividends and so on And if you take a look over the last decade weve returned about billion over the past decade The cumulative investments in our business over that period of time has been the billion or roughly billion So investments in the business and shareholder return has certainly been a focus I think really represents the results of that billion of revenue was a record year gross margins of almost at generating net income of billion or operating income of billion and net income of billion and a dividend per share increase to And for us that really represented quite nicely our performance and how the technology demonstrated over the year Id like to take that perspective and turn that into our what is our vision mission and strategy for growing this company moving forward Our mission is pretty simple and that is utilize the power of Moores Law By the way this is the th anniversary of Moores Law this year To bring smart connected devices to every person owner And the real objective here is that smart and connected And we believe and youve seen our investments in our communications technology that almost everything that you build moving forward will have some form of connection whether its WiFi Bluetooth LTE things are going to mean to be connected whether you go from data center down to the smallest of the wearables or Internet of Things all of those things have to have this connectivity And that keys into some of our strategy which Ill talk about in a bit Our vision is if its smart and connected its best with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Were really trying to use Moores Law and our architectures to really drive that best in performance And best in performance sometimes is in form factor small and light low power or sometimes its in just pure raw performance in nips or instructions or how we want to measure the performance graphics capability And our growth strategy is really driven off the combination of these two that is we believe our highest shareholder return our highest shareholder value will come from a strategy that uses our core assets to move into profitable complementary markets The good example of that is how weve started with the PC and what Ill call client computing and moved that in both directions And weve taken those technologies and moved into the data center and have built data center products now that have built off those same cores those same silicon technology And we moved down into the Internet of Things Many of the cores that we use many of the products that we develop for the Internet of Things are simply products that we scale down or made small altercations to to bring them to the Internet of Things So those are two good examples that demonstrate that strategy and action I thought I would take a look there at what we said last year This is my third shareholder meeting And I think that one of the things that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>prides itself is being held accountable and showing performance And so we went back and we pulled up our foil from and we thought we would grade ourselves a little bit and well talk about this We said we would do five things in that we would continue to lead in Moores Law well talk a little bit about that we build on our ultra mobile momentum And this is really around tablets and phones and well talk about that both in and well talk about that again in And we continue PC innovation core of the business the majority of our revenue and income comes from and we need to continue to innovate there And we delivered doubledigit growth in the data center and well talk about that but as we said this really drives off the fundamental technologies and architectures that we built in the core products And then drive leadership in the Internet of Things and wearables and well show you some examples of that this morning as well So lets take a look at these one at a time and how to break them down and look at the performance in If I take a look at the first one continue to lead in Moores Law We continue to think that this is really one of the corestrengthens of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Last year in we introduced our fifth generation core products on our nanometer technology But in addition to that weve introduced products in the memory space that are really leading in both density and cost with D NAND We believe we have a worldclass leadership position here with D NAND And then just our overall silicon technology nanometers is our second generation of D transistors or FinFETs for those who know the real definition of it And its our true nanometer technology leading in density and compaction So we continue to see that our Moores Law leadership continues We continue to see Moores Law beyond what you might read in the press that Moores Laws ending we see a future of Moores Law well beyond what is presented off and out there So Moores Law is alive and going The next thing we said we would do is PC innovation And I really think this has been a great year for this space We said last year we would accomplish a couple of things First was we said wed establish a footprint in the critical tablet business And if you remember at the beginning of the year we said we would go out and we would ship million units of tablets At the end of the year we were really proud with that so wed actually beaten that by considerable margin we shipped million tablets We actually became the number one merchants provider to the tablet industry And whats also great is we led with innovation And if those of you attended CES innovative product events was a tablet that was built between Dell and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The Venue which is just a phenomenally the worlds thinnest tablet great screen and was the first product that introduce RealSense Since then weve also in introduced a number of form factors and really innovated two in ones all in ones theyre becoming thinner lighter and more mobile You can see that people are starting to utilize those much more And an entirely new form factor with the Compute Stick where you can now take a full computer with you in your pocket and plug it into almost any monitor We really believe this is a form factor that will continue to grow as we look forward and youll see even more innovation in this space With products from all price points and we introduced the product last year SoFIA SoFIA is a product Im very product of SoFIA was not even on our roadmap as we entered into the fourth and third quarter of And by the end of not only had we qualified that product for production but weve gone into China and built a partnership with Rockchip to produce those parts as well and they do their own designs around that architecture And I can tell you that towards the end of Q of this year they actually qualified their products as well On both of those products weve already gotten orders for over million units on each So a product that was not even on our roadmap a year and half has already have orders for over million units in each and is shipping in production Weve worked really hard to become OS agnostic and we make sure that our products run on over OS out there I think this is critical for the growing markets and the diversity of the markets that were into And really where I see a future of computing is in these experiences and innovations there We started to see really just the inkling versus what we see in our labs and were starting to see wireless charging As we go through into the second half of this year more and more of our products will ship with wireless charging and then youll begin to see RealSense We have product shipping right now with RealSense but as we go in again through the remainder of this year and into next RealSense which is really giving compute eyes the ability to both see you and see the world and understand it do something with it Its going to really change computing as we know it Youre interaction with computing but computings interaction with the world All of those things will shift we believe with these experiences So we really feel good about the innovation that weve done on the client space in this last year with a lot more moving forward in The data center I think is we look at it as our next big growth engine for the company Its a business thats over billion a year now it grew at last year and its being fueled by almost every segments of the data center from software defined networking and infrastructure to enterprise computing high performance computing Big Data applications And you saw our relationship with Cloudera this year and our efforts to really improve Big Data applications and the speed at which they can be implemented And then one thats the big driver is the cloud Remember we said everything needed to be connected and the importance of that thats because everything feeds into the cloud now And all your data and your information tends to move there and that connectivity provides that ability But our data center products are really what fuels and powers the cloud as well Thats allowed to grow at last year Weve committed to grow at through this decade And as I said this will be the next real engine of the company for revenue and growth The next area is really driving some of the next I would say the future of where computing is headed and thats really the Internet of Things and wearables And you saw us really drive a new energy and a new focus on the Internet of Things Internet of Things business grew last year and its over a billion business annually now So this is not a new and emerging business this is a billion business growing at We said we can commit to grow through this decade in those mid to high teens as this business continues to expand And people talk about billion devices by that will be tied into this Internet of Things and again that connectivity comes to play there Weve got products like SoFIA Edison the Galileo boards and you saw us introduce at CES of this year Curie which is a full computer that can fit in a button on your jacket The products that are being innovated will come out on all of these devices over the next few years are amazing And in wearables you saw use we have the Basis Peak watches which are really if you look at fitness tracking and fitness monitoring one of the best products out there You saw us introduce the MICA bracelet with Opening Ceremony which is really a full cellphone on your wrist from a data standpoint and a variety of partnerships with companies leading companies like Fossil and SMS and Oakley and Luxottica all of these companies are working with us now to build products over the next couple of years in this wearable space using these innovative technologies like Edison and Curie and products beyond those that we havent even introduced yet So those were our key imperatives for We feel very good about our progress there I thought I would then take a look so you can measure us again next year at the same meeting and what our imperatives are for First is to continue to innovate in the core business The client computing PCs desktop mobile and tablets will continue to be a core of this business We need to continue to innovate there We think this year we will ship somewhere between million and million phones into the market Asus ZenFone which launched earlier this week in the US is just one example of products now coming to the US with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside So were making progress in all areas of the mobile in this segment Profitably grow our mobile business Were committed to reduce our losses in this space by million this year and we are on target to do that Stacy and I report at every quarterly meeting our progress and we are on target there Deliver doubledigit growth in the datacenter And as I said weve committed to have through this decade we will continue to grow that this rate You saw results in Q continued to meet or beat those numbers Grow our next new big businesses which we really look at is the IoT space and that memory space D NAND we believe gives us a very competitive cost and density advantage that will let us continue to grow whats over a billion business in memory already And then we talked about the IoT which again is an over billion business which grew at last year and will continue to grow in those teens for this year as well And then lastly is continue to lead in Moores Law The fundamental driver of this company will always be Moores Law and the silicon underneath it And we need to continue to be seen as the leader and to actually deliver those leadership products And so Moores Law is critical to how we drive the growth The last thing I want to talk about is that a company needs to do all of that while taking care of the community and planet we all live in And so we call that doing the right things the right way which is really delivering those results in a way that has a corporate responsibility and a community responsibility Today we released our th Annual Corporate Responsibility Report and we invite you to go visit our website to download and learn more about the responsible businesses and practices that we follow in all around the world I am very proud of that as a company Ive been a part of this company for over years and thats always been an area that I personally have engaged in And I can tell you with high confidence thats an area that we as shareholders should be proud of And so I really invite you to go look at that report And as you drive out today if you look up on the roof of our main building you will see I think theres about micro turbines and there will be over level largest micro turbine installations in California at least as we continue to generate power in alternative ways so to say So with that I would like to invite Andy and Rene on stage Andy back on stage Rene let me introduce Renee James our President of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and we are I am going to hand it quickly over to Andy in order to take questions Were not going to sit down because were trying to keep this media a little more informal And Andy you know how to control So well take questions from this audience we also will take questions from the web If you have questions we have two mics set up so please get to one of the mics In fairness to all who wish to speak we ask each speaker to limit their time two minutes Any specific topic will be limited to six minutes And with that well take the first question actually we have one in the room Ill go and take one in the room here Please state your name and your question My name is Peter Fant ph and I came all the way New Mexico And I appreciate thanks for the presentation I appreciate the corporate response because particularly I wanted to address that or bring that up as also the diversity in the workplace that Bryant had been in the press that Bryant has been the champion because what I do right now I have a company in New Mexico and I work with your New Mexico operation for outreach to Native Americans and particular we have a STEM scholarship program that Intels now been involved with and theyve been working with us and were looking at students that were getting out of program and getting into internships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>And its a particular challenge just because with this particular ethnicity its not only working with the students but its getting back into the communities And your guys out there Sean Sabeti ph in the Rio Rancho Facility is doing great job working with us getting into the communities getting that message back to grade schools So it really ties the corporate responsibility that Brian mentioning and I just wanted to let you know I really appreciate that and look for continued support in the future So thank you Its our transparency I should say And Peter is a good friend of mine And it just shows you that people who are raised up in similar ways end up in similar type of jobs and with the similar value set So his effort on social responsibility with his company has been equally as good as well Let me take the next question from the web Question is what mechanism does the Board use to evaluate the performances of directors And for that one I would like to turn it over to our Lead Independent Director Sue Decker who is here in the front Do we have a mic for Su Yes we have been evaluating director performance for over years We have an annual process that we go through as a team We take into account individual performance we take into account committee efficiency and effectiveness and we take into account how the Board works as a whole This last year we decided to add to that a deep interview system of all of the directors and that will be overseen by the Lead Independent Director but conducted by an independent third party So we plan to start that in January and do that annually to coincide with the performance evaluations of employees Thanks My name is Sheldon Ehrlich ph I am a very small shareholder How can we get business from Apple Thats my question Thats good All the Mac lines whether its an iMac or Mac Pro or MacBook Air all of those products and innovation that goes in side of our are based on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture And we worked together veryvery closely with Apple team to deliver those products I think they represent the innovation in the industry quite well So thats if you take a look at it thats a growing part of our business and its a growing segment and I want to continue to earn that business And thats what key with Apple There is that iPhone Again you see us weve had to point the Company to the mobile space to the phone and the tablet space We made great inroads in tablets last year and we said wed be shipping somewhere between million and million phones this year The way to win Apple is that you have to build the best products for the best price and that will be when we get into those other apple products We have to go with it And so were working on it were constantly working on it There is but it ends up its always about whether you can build a product that meets their needs at the right price So were working Okay Next question from the web will be what does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>do to align the pay of executives to drive value to stockholders For that one I would actually turn to our Compensation Committee Chair Dave Patrick Good morning everyone We work very hard at this We believe that we have alignment of the way we payforperformance Our bonus plans have very specific metrics that align payforperformance in terms of annual performance and setting the stage for the future The best majority of compensation for our CEO our President our Senior Executives and even going down into the company is around the incentive comp and thats bonus plans and stock options restricted stock a very large portion of our senior executives equity compensation is tie to the performance of our company total shareholder return of our company versus a comparable list of other tech companies And we make sure that were providing a total shareholder return that meets and exceeds these comparable companies in our industry and our executives are held accountable for that and their equity awards go up and down based upon that relative performance We consider that to be extremely important So we constantly monitor this We hire consultants to help us We try to have best practices We study other companies to make sure that were at the leading edge of making sure that our employees our leaders compensation is fully aligned with the returns to shareholders and the benefits to shareholders Is there anything also I should add to that No That sounds okay All right there you go My name is Joseph Pruss Ph <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been kind of around the block on content streaming devices thought a lot of that was abandoned couple of years back Can you explain where you see this relationship with the Chinese company Rockchip in your TV dongles or your HDMI TV sticks Where do think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going with that relationship and your new product Our relationship with Rockchip is around building products like SoFIA What they provide is a channel Actually they provide two things They are in additional design resources so they actually take our first generation SoFIA as an example And they may do additions or changes so that its targeted towards the markets and channels that they are targeting So in the cases of the GR they did some improvements to graphics they did some improvements to some of the memory modules and things like that But what they really are is they are very very good at what Ill the Shenzhen and Beijing ecosystem which is working with roughly ODMs literally ODMs that make sub tablets for Asia And that channel is one that for us to go and invest and get into would just take too much effort too much money and were not as good as that matter So working through them as a partnership we feel is a better way to enter to those markets And thats really the relationship We will bring products as they see they want to grow into segments So for example theyre GR they just qualified for IoT so they did expanded temperature and environmental specs for that product so they could take in into IoT applications and were helping them write software and applications for that Things like the Compute Stick are products that they may or may not choose to take over time You cant really use SoFIA for that product they just didnt have the graphics and things like HDMI capability But we could work with them to develop a product that could do that over time But there is no plan to do that currently with them Compute Stick is driven more by what I call our classical OEMs partners Ill take the next question on the web Can you update us on how your mobile strategy is progressing What recent successes would you highlight again Again that one is for Brian Sure So Id say again lets just take a look at last year We came out and said that we were going first target the tablet space so we get to million I think when we started last year and we put out that million unit target people kind of questioned our ability to go from roughly to million in a year And as I said we hat million tablets but really whats neat to me is the innovation that we are able to bring as well For we said well grow what the market grows out for the tablet space My guess is actually the tablet space may actually shrink a bit this year as two in ones and phablets the bigger phones kind of eat into that market But our focus for this year was to really reduce our losses in mobile That million target was what spaces I put out there for reduction of that loss and we are well on our way to that Every shareholder meeting people come in and said when are we going to see you in a phone Weve been shipping phones starting in last year to some volume But again we think well be in roughly million to million phones this year and you can actually start to see and penetrating the US with the ZenFone is the first example of that So we feel like our mobile progress is going well and our strategy of entering these markets using partners like Rockchip and Spreadtrum and now focusing on cost is the right one to go to I am Shirley Lin ph of Silicon Valley I appreciate hearing that the Company name a product after Madame Curie someone who not only won a Nobel Prize but twice I have two questions today First what were the lessons learned from some instances some years ago and in they had come home to risk ph with a fine of billion The second question is without seeing any other soother seeing that today is the annual meeting how much factor does it play in the company resuming the talk with Altera so quickly What I read was in some instances happened some years ago has caused the company to be fined for billion That was in the news I saw Then I was wrong I thought it was with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and it was some years ago and it might have been something related to the European We did pay a fine over billion several years ago based on European investigation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>thats how many years ago three four five There has been nothing current there has been no issues that were aware of I thought that it was just decided completed their investigation and then decided on a fine but were the lessons learned even though there were instance that happened I mean still billions of dollars are billions of dollars I think what came out of that was a set of practice changes that weve been combined with the sales group and the legal team to really ensure that all of our sales are independent In other words we dont tie them to any kind of marketshare gains or competitive alternatives So when we go in and sell to somebody we cant tie our price to if they give us a share or they keep the competition out or any kind of competitive risks like that with a very strong audit process plus on a very strong audit process to make sure that were never selling below cost to ensure that our products are out there competing fairly with the competition and not below costs And there is a very strong audit process that again the legal team and the sales team go through on a regular basis and is inspected by our auditors as well So we have an audit process an independent audit process and a set of guidelines now for the sales and legal team to do pricing how contracts are set up and how negotiations are done to ensure that the practices are faired even Well thats good to hear because its certainly those practices are good hopefully Wall Street will follow your kind of practices as well So my second question To your second question we as a policy dont comment on rumors or reports on the papers that we we are not part of So I understood what your question was We will not comment on any negotiations with any companies that may or may not be going on The next question from bridge What is Intels longterm plan as we begin to push up against limitations of smaller transistor geometries That one I turn to Rene As you heard from Brian its the th anniversary of Moores Law And we feel that were in a normal year horizon of development and the near in fiveyear were in execution And this year we will take our nanometer process will crossover to be our predominant high volume process The thing that follows is nanometer and the nanometer development is progressing very well Youll start to see startup cost in the second half of the year on nanometer And we will talk about the timing of that later this year the early part of next year about when that will happen After comes nanometer and we feel very confident that we have line of sight of how to manufacture that note So overall we think were in very good shape My name is Guiney ph and I have couple of questions Number one is that does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have a green energy initiative in the emerging market Number two is does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have any initiative to encourage the growth of electrical vehicles in this country So I can answer both of those questions especially since I own two electric vehicles So absolutely we have an effort to work with electrical vehicles If you take a look I think we have over electric vehicle charging stations on this campus and we have them at every one of our campuses So we have actually if you take a look at the charging stations per employee theyre one of the highest densities or the largest numbers in the valley here So we are big proponents of supporting those kinds of products If you just take a look at what do we do across the world from energy reduction and energy conservation in the US we are the number one purchaser of green power and have been for three plus years probably four years now So we buy green power projects to offset a of our operational cost in the US Theres solar installations at almost every single one of our worldwide large locations So there may be small sales offices that we dont have them at or small locations or least locations But if its a companyowned and its out there almost anywhere in the world now weve installed a solar energy to pretty much maximum we can fit on our roof tops now And we are looking at continuing alternatives Weve got Bloom Energy systems which are LP driven systems in Folsom and we are installing one in India now These are first Bloom Energy system in India powering our new building that we are building there And then you see us experimenting the things like micro turbines that you will see on the roof here that if those work well carry them out to other locations as well We also have in the audience here Michael Jacobson Director of Corporate Responsibility If you have any of these types of questions you want grab some of the afterwards he is the one who got to spend some time with Next question from the web What are your longterm prospects for the PC market are you seeing continuing secular decline are you seeing a cyclical impact Brian Sure So we if you take a look at last year PC market actually grew it actually grew in the low singledigits And we think that was largely fueled by XP replacement And so we continue to see growth from that As we entered this year we are going through another transition Windows upgrades And we are seeing some quartertoquarter pushing but we continue to take a view of our longterm forecast A longterm forecast is the PC market should be flat to slightly down mid singledigits over the longterm There are going to be years where its higher its positive and there is going to be years where it will be a little bit lower and it will certainly have quartertoquarters call it economic or macro implications But over that long haul we think it will be stable to down mid singledigits Weve built that into all of our forecasts and we are offsetting that with growth in the datacenter and those other businesses And thats how we grow the company My name is Steve Young ph from Hillsboro Oregon I am a shareholder I am concerned about the Folsom site the lake or the Folsom Lake is the principal water source for Folsom and last year it was on the verge of dead pool which is a federal designation where the water the level drops below the water intake for clean water Is there any plan to move Folsom site or any plan for the site at all And is there going to be anymore expansion in Oregon So there is no plan to move the Folsom site Remember the Folsom site is not a manufacturing site its mostly I will call it office building kind of site so its not a heavy water user in anyway I agree California is state wide under a drought condition And if you take a look at this site for example were expanding it into other sites or so thats surely pulling out of our lawn If you go into our central courtyard we have taken all our lawn So were trying to become more and more water wise and we will move that to Folsom as well I cant talk about theres no published plans for further expansion in Hillsboro but I can talk about things that are on a public roadmap Next question from the web What is the company doing to increase diversity on the Board I will take that one Most people say diversity they are talking about a general unrepresented minorities So let me start there We did adopt a policy its in the Proxy Statement that says as we look at approval of candidate we will ensure that we have both generative diversity and unrepresented minorities We currently have I would say a list of potential future candidates who are looking at and then hats included that our policy says it will be But really to us diversity goes well beyond that If you look at our Board I think you would realize it has been thoughtful everybody nominee gets elected a day its Ph We have strategic professor we have technical professor we have two current setting CEOs we have people from Washington DC legal representatives So if you look at the way weve built this Board weve built it looking at a different skills and capabilities we might need Weve actually looked at international Weve had in the past a Director from outside United States So our concept is to find what we think are the matching skills for the Board and to complement we do believe stronger that you get a better results if you have diverse skill in the room and hear diverse opinions and voices I think you were on the mic next so well hear Good morning As one of the older member of the stockholder group I remember when my first times in business we were talking about never using germanium is the chip from which were working And as a member and as working for Californias two technologies Jet Propulsion Laboratory that time we were one of the first to have to move to Silicon So the question Im asking is how far can we ride this silicon horse and what is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doing to take care of the limit of what silicon will eventually the limits that silicon will eventually impose upon us and what alternative is available to us As I said in my earlier answer I think we have good line of sight with silicon for many notes to come We have an advance RD organization that looks at materials and is looking to beyond the year horizon and experimenting Would you add more to that We put materials on silicon now to enhance silicon So we deposit germanium and we can deposit the films that you probably look at next for speed and performance truly just on the silicon itself to build those devices Beyond that we are looking at other products as Rene said But right now those are outpassed the year mark And the reason I dont give you a list of them is because the way we have it always is in this funnel and there is probably of those elements today that will narrow down over time Hello My name is Shirley Lin Kinoshita I am President of the Silicon Valley United Nations Association and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Shareholder I just wanted to applaud you for your corporate responsibility You live in a world that has many needs One thing I did not hear was Intels corporate response to humanitarian needs We are facing tremendous stresses from refuges and migrants in the world that are affecting us locally as well as worldwide The United Nations is celebrating its th anniversary this year It was founded in San Francisco So we have close ties as a region to the principles of the United Nation which includes human rights as well as humanitarian aid So what is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doing specifically in this arena So we do many things to start with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>philanthropies and foundation So our foundation efforts we work with a variety of multinational organizations both on direct relief for things like existing disasters like earthquakes in the fall et cetera We send technical people We actually have an outreach team that comes in and mobilizing team and helps with technology and getting people back connected When we had earthquake in Chengdu we actually used our own facility for clean water and for housing people So we do have a response team as part of our foundation for immediate to faster Then through NGOs we have foundation contributions and our employees are able to their own donating through our <span
