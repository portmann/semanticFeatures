#A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cancelled OnCue its TV project Now it is throwing in the towel on mobile Additionally the company is going to execute a layoff in the coming months Both measures are counterproductive for a company that needs its best employees to turn the ship around Recode reports that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has invested billion in its mobile unit over the last years Now the company is throwing in the towel on this endeavor After last weeks announced layoff this is another set of negative signs coming from the giant chipmaker Brian Krzanich argued the company needs flexibility to invest in hot segments like Cloud and the Internet of Things IoT Intels management seems to be suggesting that layoffs and RD crash programs are the way to achieve flexibility I couldnt disagree more Three years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>launched an offensive to get a nice piece of the mobile chip market The company showed willingness to put huge financial resources and technical staff behind this ambitious project However fast forwarding years to the present <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>just killed several mobilerelated programs Additionally one of the first measures taken by the current management team was to cancel the TV project Clearly theres a pattern here Philip Fisher the growth investing legend once said that research projects cancellation was a waste of money but more than this a waste of brain power Brilliant scientists are put on fiveyear projects just to see them cancelled after just three years All the work goes down the drain and the scientists are relocated to some other tasks starting from scratch Thus preventing the staff from gaining the technical reputation that so many times drives the ambition of great minds This doesnt seem to be a good allocation of the companys resources nor the way to motivate the bright minds that can come up with the innovations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to improve On another note <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced that it intends to part ways with of its employees The company also stated that it will pursue voluntary and involuntary agreements to achieve that figure My view on layoffs is always pretty negative and I have voiced against investing in companies undertaking this tactic Usually layoffs are the managements confession of poor business decisions and in my experience it doesnt really help managements devising better business strategies Actually it works inversely When a company announces a layoff employees cannot avoid reading such initiative as a war declaration Basically the company is saying that when problems arise it wont care about employees itll just care about shortterm results and Wall Street The theoretical negative impact on productivity and employee morale is well known but since these are difficult to measure many managers and investors tend to overlook them However the problem is well beyond productivity and morale Voluntary severance packages are an open door for the best brains to leave Only the employees who feel confident enough about their own skills will pursue opportunities outside the company Layoffs are the best way to leave a company struggling with mediocrity or metaphorically speaking leaving a body with no head There are some positives that may or may not offset the gloomy picture presented in the previous paragraphs Going through Glassdoor I like to check this website to get the employees feel on the company reviews on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already incorporate a negative sentiment towards layoffs However even considering the layoffs they still see the company as a great place to work in full of competent people and compelling projects Additionally focusing on growth segments where margins are above the companys average is a sound strategy If the present layoffs and project cancellations end up being a oneoff then the current refocusing strategy might work in the long run Intels problem seems to be the lack of consistency coming from the management team Three years ago they were fully committed to mobile but now that mobile is no longer the hot trend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is giving up Who knows what will happen to the current bet on Cloud years from now Management behavior seems erratic and suggests that the present efforts to refocus might be scrapped if new problems arise during the process We will need to wait and see but overall Im not positive on this one Most likely the current layoff program and the lack of persistence on RD projects will have a negative impact on sales and margins During the next years profit margins and return on equity will be good indicators of a successful turnaround The company claims to be refocusing on areas where it has better margins therefore if the turnaround is successful we should see some improvements on margins and ROE If the indicators dont improve enough that might be happening because the company is no longer capable of keeping its brightest minds paving the way for the future In order words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might have lost its head Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and
