class='textDiv'>AMDs Financial Analyst Day What Did We Learn Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD will not be releasing ANY nm parts including GPUs and Project Skybridge processors K will be delayed to but thats of little consequence As many readers know AMD NASDAQ AMD had their Financial Analyst meeting on May th with a lot of important information given and many of their confusing strategies cleared up Unfortunately theres a lot of misinformation including articles based on false charts Its important to completely understand AMDs strategy which would have made it obvious the chart was false due to Ks positioning Otherwise its very difficult to understand whats real what isnt and whats actually important This also allows us to understand if their strategy is coherent and plausible In many ways the company has very nearly reversed itself from previous strategies due to the loss of the fabs as well changes in market dynamics Some of this is due to Intels NASDAQ INTC change in focus and much of it is due to the emergence of other very competent microprocessor designers The AMD of the past was content to sell into the lowend of the market and fight on price This was feasible with one competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and that competitor being relatively expensive On top of this AMD had fabs and it had massive expenses associated with them As such it had to move products in volume and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was content to allow it Of course AMD has since spun off its fabs Equally important the market has fundamentally changed So has AMD Perhaps most significantly the growth of smartphones and tablets has caused a shift in the market dynamics Not only are there more opportunities there are more competitors These new devices also negatively impacted AMDs core business the PC market The shrinking of the PC market and the new competition also has caused <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to become extremely aggressive in pricing its lowend parts Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has fabs that need to keep busy and with the PC market shrinking it seems very likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue very aggressive pricing for the foreseeable future Of course those are mostly negative incentives that forced AMD to deprecate the lowend PC market There also are positive influences including Intels recent Core releases not appreciably improving performance Add to this the recent advances by AMDs fabrication partners and theres a real opportunity for AMD Many will feel that AMD should compete in smartphones and lowend tablets because they are big markets However an unbiased view begs the question of what AMD could realistically bring to these markets that would give them an advantage over the crowded field of ARM processor manufacturers That AMD is moving from the lowend to the highend is unmistakable Of course the company was never entirely lowend and will not be exclusively highend but the overall trajectory of the company is clearly following this course Management has made this decision without having all the parts in place to do it Clearly this transition is perilous while the technology tries to catch up with the new market focus with awkward and painful earnings part of transformation Its imperative that one understand that AMDs strategy has changed dramatically Their other decisions have to be judged on that context not on the former reality The meeting dispelled two important questions we had whether the next generation GPUs will be nm and what happened to Project Skybridge The answer to the first question is no Project Skybridge always something I wasnt clear would provide real value is dead In both cases they were sensible decisions Skybridge was often misunderstood and only represented using the same socket for both ARM and x Dropping that in itself isnt a big deal because having it wasnt a big deal But there are associated implications that are much more revealing Perhaps more importantly is we will not see a nm ARM chip or Puma Also theres no mention of Puma successors which could indicate the end of this heretofore very successful design This is a very risky decision if true and could show the lack of development resources AMD has However this is not a certainty as it could be included in the ASeries Lisa Su spoke of but this seems somewhat unlikely It may be disappointing to many that AMD has stuck with the nm node for the GPUs This probably also points to AMDs shrinking resources and being forced to make difficult decisions Since the node will have a relatively short useful life as FinFets follow the cost may not have justified the benefit Either way for High Bandwidth Memory will be the major new feature for AMDs highend GPUs FinFets will have to wait until Another sign of AMDs diminishing RD budget showed up with the delay of K AMDs new ARM processor This was originally intended for and has been pushed back to ostensibly to focus on Zen Zen an x processor is clearly more important and choosing it over K is a correct and obvious decision However that this decision had to be made at all shows a disturbing lack of resources Other than that moving K back to will have little impact on the company as the market for this processor is not developed regardless of how competent it may prove to be As time progresses so should this market although I believe more slowly than most are predicting There were a few very positive indications from the management at least from my perspective It has been my contention for quite some time AMD has to take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on directly and compete on singlethreaded performance I also believed Zen will define the company far more materially than anything and everything else AMD does The whole approach of avoiding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>always seemed very misguided and moving away from a market with million units per year with one competitor even more so Those days are over thank goodness Zen is clearly intending to take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on in performance not avoid it It does not apologize for CPU performance while trying to convince the customer they really need GPU performance As if to confirm its conviction AMD will be releasing Zen first as a FX processor not as an APU As an FX processor it will have to stand on its merits as a CPU and management seems very confident it can Many reading this will have the obvious point of view that AMDs position might be chestpounding and fluff to push their product However if one contrasts that with the position of the company with the releases of Kaveri and Carizzo the emphasis is completely different For the latter two AMD stressed either GPU performance or power savings but not CPU performance With Zen which Mark Papermaster says improves IPC by compared to Excavator Carizzo is being described mainly by its performance Also refreshing was AMDs new commitment to the server segment This also indicates confidence in processor performance because this segment is much less costsensitive and values performance and performance per watt highly All in all there was a lot of bad going from abandoning nm products including Skybridge and GPUs as well as clear consequences of the reduction in RD Moving K back to is yet another face on that picture Most alarming to me is the possibility the cat processor line is being abandoned but that is not certain All of that falls to nothing if Zen is a good processor and AMD seems to be placing the proper emphasis on its importance as well as confidence in it As many have seen me say in my articles the technology is what matters and everything else is fluff When Lisa Su said essentially the same thing and when Mark Papermaster discussed how they greatly improved the cache and memory subsystem two other areas Ive hammered AMD on I gained a lot more confidence that management was deadon I didnt want to see a Zen APU at least not first I wanted an FX and got it I didnt want to hear about Zens performance per watt ad naseum or HSA I wanted to hear confidence in raw CPU performance I got it I didnt want to hear about building OEM relationships for more unit sales but the importance of technology I got it After hearing so much nonsense for so long and the improper emphasis on things that dont matter I came out of this feeling much better about the company And Zen Which is pretty much the same thing for now Source AMDs Financial Analyst Day What Did We Learn Disclosure The author is long AMD MoreThe
