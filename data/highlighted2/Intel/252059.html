Expected growth is not what it seems Management has history of being too optimistic Last time short interest was this low shares collapsed in following months Weve seen a nice rally in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC after some positive news at the companys Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provided a decent forecast and raised its dividend sending shares back to again Unfortunately for investors I believe the stock is fully priced currently and see a few factors that could limit upside in the coming quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guided to midsingle digit revenue growth for next year and were starting to see analysts adjust their forecasts Some have already hiked their numbers with the current average estimate calling for top line growth in That number is likely to go higher because at least one current estimate calls for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>revenues to decline next year which right now seems unlikely There are a few items to consider when examining this guidance however First management detailed that this will be a week fiscal year The extra week based on average forecasts for accounts for more than of the expected dollar increase next year Additionally weve seen a number of recent years where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guided to decent future year revenues only to cut those forecasts as the year went on was a great example of this and dont forget last years investor meeting called for mid single digit revenue growth this year That hasnt worked out with analysts looking for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to report a decline in revenues for The other large part of revenue growth comes from the Altera NASDAQ ALTR acquisition which is a very expensive purchase Based on current expectations after subtracting out cash and debt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is paying more than times sales for Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>itself currently trades for less than times expected sales so you can see how much of a premium is being paid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is hoping the Altera purchase will keep the Data Center Groups revenue growth in the mid teens for years to come Over the last year or two Ive detailed the substantial decline in short interest for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>As seen in the chart below more than of shares short have been covered since the October peak The midNovember update was the first time since May that we saw less than million shares short Source NASDAQ <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>short interest page The last time we saw short interest this low <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares peaked in the high s The PC market deteroriated as progressed short interest skyrocketed and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares fell nearly With Intels business being less PC reliant currently than it was a few years ago I dont see that kind of fall happening right now However it is important to note that the number of shares outstanding for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is down about since Q of With a lower float this time around a jump of say million shares short will have a larger impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock than it did a few years ago In the last three months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares are up almost while major competitor Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM is down by I feel that the recent rally in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>including the postInvestor Day meeting jump have basically priced in next years progress Im just not convinced there is a ton of upside for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>currently and neither do analysts if you look at their opinions The table below shows some key comparisons between the two The analyst rating scale has a strong buy at and a hold at Qualcomm has a much higher dividend yield and is buying back a ton of shares right now Even if I take down Qualcomms average price target by due to its lack of growth and current troubles that name still has about upside At this point the street sees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as fairly valued and I pretty much agree when expectations are already high and the name has a history of disappointing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares have rallied since the Investor Meeting putting the name at a level where I think the stock is very fairly valued With the company getting most of its growth next year from the Altera purchase and an extra week in the calendar the growth story is not very impressive Weve seen rosy forecasts from the name in recent years only to see guidance cut during the year With short interest at its lowest point in a couple of years one piece of negative news could send shorts right back in Qualcomm offers a higher dividend yield and stronger buyback and analysts see Qualcomm with more potential upside While Im not arguing for a short position currently I think investors looking to buy would be better off waiting until <span
