Kesarios Google is rumored to be exploring the possibility of developing its own chip to bring uniformity to the Android ecosystem Besides uniformity Google needs the extra horsepower to power Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality applications of the future However uniformity and horsepower aside if Google makes its own chips it might end up making a lot of money in the process It has been reported that Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is in talks with several chip makers about developing a chip specifically designed by Google to bring uniformity to the Android ecosystem Indeed one of the reasons why Apple NASDAQ AAPL has been so successful is because it has total control over both hardware and software As a result Apple devices allocate the correct amount of horsepower for each specific job and work better and faster than Android devices This despite the fact that many highend Android devices seem to have better hardware specs than the iPhone And while the Android ecosystem is bigger than Apples ecosystem Apple is constantly gaining market share and almost commands a monopoly at the highend side of the smartphone spectrum Besides the issue of uniformity and the ability to compete with Apple at the highend spectrum Google also wants to lay the groundwork for a new generation of devices that will be able to handle VR Virtual Reality and AR Augmented Reality applications Indeed I have seen several prototype AR applications and the possibilities and applications are endless The only restriction is your imagination However especially in the case of AR less so I think for VR a lot of information needs to be collected and processed at once World Lens for example is such a AR application In this case you have a video stream a translation mechanism that is based on figures it does not translate text and at the same time movement stabilization not to mention a wide variety of sensors that are needed AR applications really need a lot of processing power to work and Google is right in looking at AR and VR as the future And Google also is right that a new chip design will remove a lot of bottlenecks and make Android phones more ergonomic Uniformity might mean money lots of it However setting aside the issue of uniformity and the competition with Apple at the highend there is something else that I see happening and that is Google will be making a lot of money by consolidating the Android ecosystem Lets say for example that Google sanctions six processor designs for OEM manufacturers depending on how highend of a device they want to make Google can actually make a lot of money by selling these chips and any other hardware it designs to OEMs I mean its one thing to control the software alone and permit everyone to make a device with whatever parts and chips they want and its a totally different ballgame when you have complete control over the hardware also If indeed Google forces Android manufacturers to conform to its hardware Android blueprint that opens up the door to a plethora of revenue sources that might mean grater profits for Google Google also can reserve the most highend chip for its own devices such as the Nexus line Yes that would mean its competing with other manufacturers but so what And because the Android universe is so larger chances are Google will contract several chip manufacturers to make its Android chips There is no shortage of picks Samsung OTCSSNLF Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and MediaTek can all handle the job In fact a little competition among these companies for who will deliver the best chip will not hurt Uniformity and horsepower aside Google needs to do this because it is fighting a losing battle at the highend of the smartphone spectrum And thats where all the money is Make no mistake Android is very popular because most devices sold are at the lowend of the spectrum In mature markets Apple is still considered the premium choice any way you look at it According to ComScore not only does Apple have the highest market share in the US but it is the only one with a growing market share But the same thing is happening in China and Europe According to market research firm Kantar Worldpanel In the first quarter of the iPhone and Plus continued to attract consumers across Europe including users who previously owned an Android smartphone reported Carolina Milanesi chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech On average across Europes big five countries during the first quarter of Apples new customers switched to iOS from Android In urban China Apple consolidated its leadership in smartphones growing its share to up from for the same period in said Tamsin Timpson strategic insight director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia Thirtyeight percent of iPhone buyers were recommended an Apple device by someone they know while recall seeing an ad China is now driving more volume for Apple than the US as the Cupertino company reaches beyond the more affluent buyers In Q Apple represented of smartphone sales in urban Chinas to RMBs income bracket a percentage point increase from the same period in Yes Android is still the leading OS in the smartphone space but only because people cant afford to buy an iPhone But when peoples standard of living rises as in China then they prefer the iPhone vs an Android device almost every time Also while I know many Android users who would love to buy an iPhone if they could afford it I do not know a single iPhone user who recommends or wants to purchase an Android device The only way for Google to try to reverse this trend at the highend of the smartphone spectrum is to come up with a device good enough to challenge Apple The only way to do this is to make a device that is more powerful than todays devices that can perform complicated functions without crashing all the time This requires streamlining the design and hardware specs so consumers can distinguish such a device by name and design And taking over the hardware design is part of the solution The truth of the matter is that Apple has almost total control of the highend smartphone space and Google and its Android platform are very far behind The only way for Google to have a chance to reverse this trend is to bring uniformity to the Android ecosystem and update the platform so as to make Android devices more powerful and ergonomic especially for the applications of tomorrow such as AR and VR Designing its own chips and forcing OEMs to use them is the right decision toward this end However Google also can make a lot of money from uniformity acting as a franchisor for OEMs who want to make Android devices Furthermore Google can reserve highend chips for its own devices because as Apple has proved there is a lot of money to be made in hardware if you know what you are doing Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT also is following in Apples footsteps even if its simply acting as an OEM itself and has not announced any plans to make its own chip yet please consider Microsoft Is Copying Apples Strategy And It Will Work However if Google makes the right moves not only will the Android ecosystem be more uniform not only will Android devices work better but Google might make tons of money in the processes by not leaving hardware money on the table as it is doing at the moment Many years ago Steve Jobs said If you are serious about software you need to make your own hardware Google and Microsoft have just come to realize this and its better late than never Editors Note This
