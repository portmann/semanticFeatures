first year Watch sales Apples earnings report for the March quarter will come in as expected I expect revenue guidance for June to be flat yy which will come as a relief to most of us Apple investors Apple NASDAQ AAPL guided to a yy decrease in revenue of at the high end of its range and I expect Apple to hit close to the high end at billion for its fiscal Q ending in March Despite the disappointing yy decline investors have reason for optimism going forward The impact of the Samsung OTCSSNLF Galaxy S appears to have been less than expected and first year Watch sales are expected to have outperformed the iPhone in its first year Perhaps the best news Ive seen about iPhone sales for the March quarter has come from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners which issued a press release showing that iPhone increased market share yy in the US versus Samsung in the March quarter as shown above iPhone suffered very little sequential decline in market share with about of activations versus in the December quarter This was very surprising to me considering the early release of the S in late February Samsung had also sweetened the deal by giving away its Gear VR headset designed to work with the S and S smartphones Besides the CIRP data Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM earnings for Q didnt suggest particularly strong sales of the S which uses the Snapdragon processor for the US market The is an excellent processor arguably better than the A in the iPhone s so I was expecting strong S sales but the numbers just werent there for Qualcomm Qualcomms chip shipments declined yy despite having a presumably easier compare since Qualcomm missed out on the S released at the end of Q The waters are a little muddy since Qualcomm also sells modems for iPhone and clearly suffered a yy decline as expected for that product Still the fact that the iPhone increased market share yy in the US I regard as a net positive for Apple even if its difficult to be quantitative about the impact The other bit of good news was Daisuke Wakabayashis article in the Wall Street Journal also carried in Market Watch that pointed out that analysts estimate that Apple sold million Watches in its first year Thats about double the number of iPhones in its first year Although critics have characterized the Watch as an iPhone accessory this ignores its considerable standalone capability in fitness tracking and even music playback through Bluetooth headphones The characterization also ignores the clear longterm direction which is to make Watch a standalone communications device capable of voice and data communication without tethering to an iPhone Technical hurdles remain of course but Apple is all about packing more and more functionality into smaller and smaller form factors Ive seen comments to the effect that no one would want to hold the Watch up to the ear in order to make calls Actually that wouldnt be necessary Users will be able to use a Bluetooth headset or use a speakerphone mode as they currently can do with the iPhone Both iPhone and Watch will get substantial upgrades to their processors in the next generation of devices Processor upgrades dont seem to excite financial analysts very much who often disparage them as incremental But Apples processor upgrades have been anything but incremental usually offering a performance improvement Plus theyve been occurring annually a pace that is leaving old line semiconductor companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC winded and doubled over with chest pains Apples processors have been critical enablers for its large screen iPhones as well as its Pro series of tablets The tablet processors have already achieved rough parity with the low end of the Core m Skylake series and at Apples current pace could move ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the next generation iPhone and iPad Pros This will be a watershed event for Apple investors to look forward to Unfortunately iPhone SE and the inch iPad Pro probably arrived too late in the quarter to have much impact Both were scheduled to begin shipping at the end of March so some sales may have been booked but it probably wasnt that many In the table below I summarize my estimates for the March quarter My estimates put Apple revenue pretty close to the high end of guidance billion We all knew that iPhone sales were going to decline yy pretty steeply The March quarter comp was actually more difficult than December due to the fact that Apple didnt reach supply demand balance at the end of December The operating income and operating margin declines are more severe than revenue due to my expectation that Apple will not back off from its massive RD expansion I expect RD to grow yy to billion Im not prepared to be very specific about the June quarter guidance yet partly because Foxconn Hon Hai Precision has decided to hold up their March monthly revenue report which would normally have been posted by midApril I cant help feeling that this is in reaction to my using their monthly revenue as guidance for Apples quarterly reports Despite this June is starting to feel like a turnaround quarter with flat revenue yy This is driven by two considerations The first is that the iPhone SE is still on backorder on the Apple site and the wait has actually increased to weeks This suggests that the SE will be able to take up the slack in the June quarter The other consideration is the inch iPad Pro which received an exceptional rating from Displaymate for its screen Combined with Apples most powerful AX processor I expect the smaller Pro to stimulate upgrades among iPad users Other factors that Im considering include Intels curtailing of contra revenue for its tablet processors and the consequent yy decline in tablet processor sales in the March quarter Although I dont have a lot of hard data to support my optimism I expect investors to be pleasantly surprised by Apples guidance for the June quarter I expect revenue guidance to be approximately flat yy and if thats what we get investors will heave a sigh of relief Unlike some analysts Im very optimistic for the September quarter and the new iPhone and probably Watch releases As Ive pointed out the probability is high that Apple will be using TSMCs NYSE TSM InFO process for the next system on chip SOC for iPhone While the S got a millimeter thicker than the S Apple will be moving in the opposite direction producing its thinnest lightest iPhone ever iP will also benefit from the improved display technology of the inch iPad Pro I actually consider that this is a better display technology overall than AMOLED so I dont think that iP will be disadvantaged compared to the myriad Android phones that use AMOLED Based on the iPhone and improving iPad and Watch sales I expect Apple to resume growing revenue and earnings by the December quarter I remain long Apple and recommend it
