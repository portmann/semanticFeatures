Alpha ARM is believed to provide competitive or better performanceperwatt ratios compared to Intels solutions AMD Opteron A series is old and disappointing while other ARM competitors are still struggling The latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon D update has shown a fantastic performance per watt compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Haswell generation Public expectations for ARM NASDAQ ARMH server solutions are quite high This is partially caused by the recent agreements between Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and the Chinese regional government and other minor Chinese agreements not to mention the quite good performance in the mobile sector However the recent AMD NASDAQ AMD Opteron A series showed bad performance and the other ARM competitors are still relatively behind in development <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC instead has decided to heavily accelerate and release its Xeon D series which provides an astonishing performance per watt The performanceperwatt improvement is so outstanding that it practically closes a lot of enterprise markets in the short and mid term solidifying one of INTCs historically core business ARM will have serious problems in attacking INTC and it may manage to enter only those niche markets where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom series is still the most competitive solution till Denvertons arrival And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to maintain a solid performance in its core business it will be able to accelerate in all other segments virtualization SSD HPC interconnections generating more profits in the following years The latest Xeon D provides cores with logic threads a Broadwellbased architecture MB of cache a W TDP and a GHz base clock It supports the VTxVTd virtualization technology RAS and full TXT AVX TSX instructions It has a dual memory channel with a maximum of GB of DDR MHz or DDRL MHz ECC or nonECC The SOC is equipped with PCIE lines and eight PCIE lines integrated IO with dual Gigabit Ethernet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ports four USB ports four USB ports and six SATA ports It is fundamentally a Broadwell chip with a full instruction support but its relatively low clock speed in conjunction with the high core count and the nm adoption makes it extremely interesting Low frequency and high core count will obviously exploit the highly multithreaded programs and situations but it is also a setting that consistently improves power consumption and efficiency This is caused by the fact that power consumption increases with frequency with a potential law which means that the performance increase is generally a lot lower than the power consumption increase In such a situation where each core exploits the low frequency the local power consumption and heat generation per each core remains very low implying that each core stays very efficient If we have a CPU with eight cores high frequency and W TDP and the same CPU architecture with cores low frequency and the same W TDP you will see that the core CPU will provide a lot better power efficiency in highly multithreaded applications In this scenario the use of the nm process nodes and the Broadwell architecture which has been designed to improve efficiency in the lowpower segment plays a fundamental and remarkable role STH has showed a first preview about the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon D using a bunch of benchmark suites and it has provided a picture that looks extremely good beyond any expectations You can see the benchmarks in the previous link but I wanted to recap the results in the following table taking a look at the score difference and the much more important performanceperwatt ratio In the table I compared the Xeon D to the other two configurations a system with a single E v W and a dual E v x W These systems provide comparable or lower absolute performance with prices slightly lower than while the dual configuration is quite popular D will surely have more hefty prices but its performances are quite astonishing It shows of multithread performance against the Dual E v while it performs better than the E v Just this performance improvement is very good and consistent but the real deal comes when we take into account the power consumption The performanceperwatt ratio increases around against the Haswell generation providing an enormous performanceperwatt jump <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has managed to reach better performance with to of power consumption enabling these systems to meet an overall W power consumption with implemented cores and a relatively low budget with GBit integrated MAC The situation looks even more positive than described by AnandTech during last summer it reviewed the Xeon D SoC which used an eightcore logic cores CPU at W TDP that is obviously less efficient than the W core Xeon D AnandTech wrote The Xeon D effectively puts a big almost unbreakable lock on some parts of the server market in the short and mid term as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will undoubtedly further improve the Xeon D line Given that the new core SOCs look more efficient than forecasted the judgment is obviously rosier and if we also take into account that the D is the top core XeonD version the D and D with W TDP will probably provide even higher power efficiency It is clear that INTC is pushing hard with its actual Broadwell Xeon series since it is providing a performancewatt boost not seen since the introduction of Xeon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is practically closing a big slice of the market at least in the shorttomedium term given that it continues to widen the XeonD offer Xeon D is a design win essentially for the network and storage device sector while it is also essential to the microserver data centernetwork edge and IoT In reality given the peculiar product that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has managed to create Xeon D is able to heavily attack the other segments It is highly suitable as a midrange Java server a textsearch engine a highend development machine or a node into a web server cluster It meets many workloads in the enterprise hyperscale and HPC data centers that are popular and with the lowerend solutions is able to provide a lot of specific features that were not present in the old Atom enterprise solutions We must also remember that the nm offer is going to grow even in the E E and Atom series providing a general and massive performancewatt boost throughout the entire gamma of products For what concerns the next product generations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is likely to introduce the Skylake architecture at nm which brings good power efficiency improvement over the Broadwell architecture mostly with low power consumption per each core and high core count After Skylake it will be Kaby Lake nm H consumerH enterprise and Cannonlake at nm H consumerH enterprise The delay for the nm is obviously related to the production and technical issues but it may also be related to the will of anticipating the enterprise solutions and accelerating the production scalability It is known that the nm Xeon Phi will hit the market between and therefore it is not impossible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to take such a route and anticipate enterprise Cannonlake by months This would imply that Kaby Lake will be only a consumer solution while INTC will not have any real delay on the enterprise market for what concerns the nm This scenario makes me think that the enterprise segment looks very solid for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which it is also able to exploit The D XPoint memory by the adoption of new SSD onSOC memory fastmemory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already shown tremendous performances with SSD and DIMM samples and it is expected to hit the market between and Its better miniaturization process remember that Samsung OTCSSNLF TSMC NYSE TSM nm is roughly equivalent to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm is a lot denser The omnipath connections and future photonics photonics is a revolutionary technology while the omnipath interconnections are the result of more than year of research with OEMs MorganfieldGoldmont will be the first mobile architecture that will not be the result of an old tweaked architecture therefore the expectations are quite high Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is working hard on the Surface Phone which would be the perfect trump card to heavily enter the smartphone market from the highend segment Even the consumer segment looks rosier since the PC sales including the in are set to recover starting from H Even if is set to be one of the most volatile years ever <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>deserves a buy for a longterm position its enterprise business is solid consumer business is reaching stability but possibly a slow recovery virtualization is growing fast INTC is well set to earn good market share from the IoT market Obviously it is possible to meet the highs and lows through the year Therefore if you worry about this roller coaster avoid any investment during this period But if your target is and after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a good long choice Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in INTC over
