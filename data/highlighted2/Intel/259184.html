The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom XZ SoC Is Now More Attractive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha As per the leaked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Tablet Application Processor Roadmap nm Cherry Trail processors will remain the de facto x processors for tablet manufacturers The Atom XZ not the Atom X is Intels best hope to make its tablet business stop bleeding money This is a followup to my article that previously discussed the importance of the Atom X Cherry Trail mobile processors A recent leak confirmed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC will still be supplying nm Airmont Cherry Trail Atom processors to tablet manufacturers next year Xiaomi and other OEMs are already using Airmont Cherry Trail Atom X processors for their WindowsAndroid tablets Digitimes chart below revealed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not coming up with new tablet processor designs next year The current Cherry Trail and Core mm family of processors will still be marketed as tablet processors for the whole of This is just in line with Intels postponement of the nm processors to Its therefore welcome news that the Atom XZ is actually capable of supporting GB RAM max memory limit The official datasheet of the nm GHz quadcore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom XZ still lists its maximum memory size at GB However a USbased vendor O Plus is already selling a in tablet notebook product that has the Atom XZ and GB of LPDDR RAM Yes the Chinese whitebox tablet vendors will likely go for the entrylevel Atom X for their sub tablets On the other hand I believe the bigger established global OEMs will go for the in form factor and use the cheapest Atom X The Atom X processors are still limited to GB of RAM which makes them less appropriate for highermargin Windows and Android OS devices The Atom XZ will probably become the bestselling processor among the Atom X and Atom X family of tablet SoCs The O Plus Notepad is a Windows hybrid that looks a lot like Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Surface The Surface has the GHZ Atom XZ and the O Plus clone uses the cheapest Atom X SoC the XZ Both of them have GB of RAM but the O Plus Notepad retails for only P here in the Philippines Just like smartphones and regular computers Windows and Androidpowered device perform better when they have more RAM Using the Intellipen with RAMintensive Windows software like Adobes NASDAQ ADBE Illustrator CC is not optimized for Windows tabletscomputers with only GB of RAM My point is that many tablet manufacturers could use the cheapest Atom X to create highquality tabletnotebook products and immediately save Bigger OEMs like Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY and Asustek OTCASUUY that thrive in thinmargin computerstablets will really appreciate the savings The compatibility of the Atom X Z with up to GB of RAM allows OEMs to create better multitasking WindowsAndroid tablets Its a differentiating factor to have a GB RAMequipped tablet now because theres still so few of them on the market today The Cherry Trail Atom X Z has better benchmark scores than the old Bay Trail Atom ZF The better integrated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Gen GPU of the Atom X definitely gives tablet vendors a real selling point they could claim that their tabletsin products are going to be better gaming machines The Tronsmart Ara X benchmarked in the chart above is a Mini PC not a tablet The MeLE PCG with the old Atom ZF SoC is a PC Stick The potential market of the Atom Z therefore also includes the growing mini PC market Likewise the GB compatibility of the cheapest Cherry Trail Atom SoC is a differentiating factor for manufacturers of mini computers and PC Sticks Mini computers for the educational market and the enterprise needs the GB RAM configuration to make them decent alldaylong productivity tools Of course there is now a Cherry Trailpowered PC Stick with GB of RAM However the topoftheline Atom Zpowered MagicStick Windows PC Stick computer retails for The manufacturer of the MagicStick therefore used the Atom Z to create a version with only GB of RAM and the Atom Z SoC I speculate that MagicStick will eventually release a model with GB of RAM and Atom Z This scenario also applies to the future versions of the Tronsmart Ara X As of now the Tronsmart Ara X has only GB of RAM Now that the Atom Z it uses actually supports higher amount of max memory I expect the manufacturer to also release a version with more GB of RAM Linux Android Chrome OS and Windows mini computers are all the same They are very energy efficient but they still need the extra RAM to make them faster multitasking computers in the office environment Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs the PC Stickmini PC market for its Atom X business to make up for any weakness in tablet sales The nm Atom X is likely not competitive enough to match the priceperformance of the entrylevel ARMbased processors of Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and MediaTek Without the same level of discounts from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I doubt if the Atom X will attract the support of stingy Chinese tablet manufacturers I reiterate my Buy rating for INTC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not exactly advertising the GB compatibility of its cheapest Atom X SoC but I expect the Atom X Z to become popular among vendors of highermargin tablets ins PC Sticks and mini PCs Its the mostappropriate processor that might find OEM bulk buyers who wont demand exorbitant discounts from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Unlike the Atom X the Atom X are targeted for mainstream products that allow manufacturers to make a decent margin The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processor that could be sold to OEMs without subsidy is therefore important toward making Intels mobile business a breakevenprofitable venture The future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in tablets and mini PCs is better off if it can permanently avoid competing with sub MediaTekpowered Android devices Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the
