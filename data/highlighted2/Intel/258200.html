this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was forced to revise guidance downward due to slower than anticipated desktop sales If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel

</span>could be seeing higher than anticipated revenues and be compelled to announce revisions upward to its Q and guidance Expected Data Center Group performance would likely propel revised guidance upward for a significant breakout of the stock above possibly above has been a slow year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC stock In the first week of January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock was hovering around right where its hovering this week The major dips in January March and June were due to negative announcements related to desktop sales These negative announcements from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were all colored with the idea that Windows and Skylake in the fall would increase PC sales Maybe PC sales are rebounding and maybe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>revenues are rising The evidence is starting to lean this direction and its likely that the first substantial news of such a rebound will send <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock much higher given the much anticipated growth in DCG sales We will not know if recent sales increases are enough to drive guidance higher until December the beginning of Intels quiet period If prior to December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has information indicating that revenues or earnings will be substantially different than they guided in October then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be compelled to announce such a revision publicly as they did in June upward and March downward These two examples show the impact such an announcement can have on stock price Following the March revised guidance positive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock rose from below to above Following the negative guidance revision in March the stock plummeted to after already dropping from due to indications of PC sales declines Note that at the investor meeting in November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was careful to point out that the guidance provided was based on the October guidance the November restatement of guidance was NOT an update based on sales in October and November Anecdotal information is all we have to go on Here are some sound bites Please add more in comments Skylake is pushing gamer PCs sales due to higher performance Skylake was later to market than anticipated reducing PC sales growth potential Microsoft stores are selling Surface devices which are available with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake processors and sales appear strong Nvidia sales of advanced graphics cards indicates very strong gaming PC sales with <span

for Skylake PCs in the home are still needed for productive work even though smartphones and phablets have replaced PCs that were used just for Internet access The rise in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price from in August to the current has been largely due to anticipation of increased PC sales and strong longterm growth in the DCG as well as nonvolatile memory Continued good news about Data Center Group growth in cloud computing network virtualization and most recently HPC high performance computing has stock buyers primed for higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock prices Lack of clear PC sales news is likely the only thing holding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price at The following chart from Finviz indicates the rising support for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock PC sales increases and DCG growth as well as the clear resistance of buyers to pay much over until clear news about PC sales growth is heard The quickly rising support line indicates that buyers expectations are rising quickly in anticipation of DCG growth and PC sales increases If these expectations are confirmed the stock is likely to rise quickly above possibly reaching over with a price to earnings ratio still less than Intels historic PE ratio of If the expectations are not confirmed the stock is likely to drop significantly In addition to news from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or generally about PC sales we also will hear this week Dec th from Adobe NASDAQ ADBE regarding their earnings Strong Adobe earnings related to the cloud could help drive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>higher By the end of this week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock will likely either see a steep rise in stock as investors anticipate growth in PC and DCG sales are confirmed or a steep decline if there is no
