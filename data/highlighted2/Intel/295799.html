MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article AMDs losses in the PC space underscore its lack of competitiveness with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AMD management maintains it can gain share in x processors in despite the late arrival of its next Zen x architecture In its earnings conference call Tuesday AMD NASDAQ AMD management claimed it would gain revenue sequentially in and be free cash flow positive for the year The basis for these claims is share gain in PC clients discrete GPUs and a semicustom win that kicks in the second half of When probed by analysts AMD could provide little rational basis for the share gain expectations After the Q earnings report I identified the death spiral that has come to characterize AMDs business As AMDs revenue continues to shrink cost reductions in the form of restructuring and asset sales have begun to impair its ability to execute competitively against its still profitable rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA The Q earnings report demonstrated this continuing revenue implosion The Q revenue of million represented a yy decline of about In Q the Computing and Graphics CG segment posted a yy decline to million in revenue The Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom EES segment also declined yy but by a lesser amount of to million in revenue While CG posted and even greater operating loss of million for the quarter compared to the year ago loss of million EES is at least holding its own with a million operating profit down yy For the full year total revenue was down about to billion and AMDs operating loss has ballooned to million from million last year CC full year revenue is down by while operating loss has exploded to million from last years million Only EES is holding its own but barely with an revenue decline for the year to billion in revenue and an operating income decline of to million Given the continuing decline in the PC market in according to IDC its obvious how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been able to maintain roughly flat revenue in its PC client business by taking share away from AMD Quite a bit of skepticism about AMDs growth projection for was voiced by analysts during the conference call CLSA Securities analyst Srini Pajjuri put it very well Lisa just going back to your annual guidance for growth if I start from down percent sequentially in Q I think you have to model double digit for the next three quarters which is well above seasonal for you So I am trying to understand where the growth is coming from In addition to the long expected semicustom win that is supposed to kick in the second half of the year AMD expects to gain share in discrete GPUs and in PC clients Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon probed further on the PC share gain expectation First I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more on how you plan to gain share on PCs for the year especially since it looks like Zen isnt really launching until the tail end of the year and looks like youre starting Q already in a hole if I compare your guidance versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in I think we did a concerted effort to clean up on some of our channel inventory both on the OEM side as well as in the DIY channel So that factor will be gone in relative to I think if you look at the product roadmap I think the product roadmap is stronger and I think if you look at our commercial business that is also stronger so its leading to a stronger product mix So those are the key factors The problem with AMDs expectation of PC market share gain in is that the key catalyst for that gain simply wont be there If AMD has any hope of regaining share against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that hope rests with the Zen architecture that AMD unveiled at its Financial Analyst Day back in May The Zen architecture is promised to be more powerful and be fabricated on a competitive nm process If Zen were going into production this year it might gain share against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Only its not as we learned at the Q earnings report AMD reiterated at the Q call that Zen will only be sampling to OEMs this year with production start at the end of the year or beginning AMD was a little vague on a specific production start probably because they arent sure themselves The Q report also contained some disquieting news about the direction that Zen will take CEO Lisa Su indicated that Zen would first be made available for desktops and then servers in One would have thought that Zen would be the right processor for the most lucrative element of the remaining PC market thin notebooks and ins Yet that doesnt seem to be happening Ideally AMD should be moving all its products to nm production The fact that they arent doing that highlights how resource constrained AMD has become AMD seems to place the greatest hope on its new Polaris GPU architecture which will be fabricated on nm If the industry were standing still this would be a master stroke and would lead to dominance of PC gaming as well as VR But Nvidia has had its Pascal architecture also expected to be on nm FinFET from TSMC in its GPU roadmap since Pascal will likely be equal or superior to Polaris and come out about the same time in the middle of The best that AMD can hope for with Polaris is that it wont lose any more market share to Nvidia And that brings us to the poster child for the AMD death spiral the long awaited ARM based server processor Seattle now dubbed the Opteron A AMD did finally announce that the A is in production and shipping in limited quantities Does anyone care anymore The roughly twoyear delay in the arrival of Seattle means that its completely obsolete Its fabricated on a TSMC nm process and completely noncompetitive with even the humblest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>server offerings in performance or price Seattle has become another demonstration of the downside of AMDs cutbacks At the very least Seattle should have been moved to a nm FinFET node either Samsungs or TSMCs But AMD couldnt afford to do that AMD presents investors with the spectacle of a management either incapable or unwilling to make the tough decisions that need to be made if AMD is to be profitable at any level of revenue Im convinced that trying to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in x architecture processors whether for PC clients or servers will never be a winning strategy Even with Zen AMD is just playing catch up with where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been technically for years No ones going to be impressed by that AMD should give up competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but its not clear that abandoning the x processor business is even an option at this late stage AMD doesnt even have enough revenue coming in to support its current operating expenses Without the revenue stream from x its not clear that it could support the staff it needs to design semicustom processors based on x As painful as it would be jettisoning the PC processor business in order to refocus on GPUs and ARM architecture is the only way forward that I can see for AMD Nvidia has proven that this is a viable approach at least for one company Its not clear that the approach can support two companies This leaves AMD rushing headlong into a dead end When the end comes it wont be pretty I continue to maintain a sell rating on AMD </div></body></html>
