Investors Should Buy Qualcomm Instead Of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomm Inc NASDAQQCOM Seeking Alpha In the chip space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm both look cheap with similar valuation profiles and dividend yields But their underlying business are going in different directions Fundamentally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is slowing down due to its reliance on the PC industry which isnt growing By contrast Qualcomm is a major player in mobile a much better place to be as the smartphone industry continues to boom Among chip stocks two companies reign supreme Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC On the surface they seem very similar They both operate in chip manufacturing and as far as their stocks both hold similar valuation profiles and offer similar dividend yields to shareholders But to me thats about where the similarities end I believe Qualcomm and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are two companies going in two different directions While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to be chained to the personal computer and it flails in its attempts to break into mobile Qualcomm is already firmly entrenched in mobile and dominates there Their similar dividend yields dont tell the whole story Qualcomms dividend is growing at very high rates while Intels dividend has grown only slightly in recent years The global smartphone boom is still in the early stages with plenty of growth left to continue which is why Im bullish on Qualcomm Qualcomms Snapdragon processor is used by a number of device manufacturers including HTC LG Sony and Droid Even outside of mobile the companys product portfolio caters to a diversified lineup of industries including automotive health care wearables and the Internet of Everything Qualcomm grew revenue by and adjusted earnings per share by last quarter year over year This was because MSM shipments soared in the same period to million units Qualcomm generates a lot of cash and now holds billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet with almost no longterm debt to worry about In comparison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to slow down because its core industrythe personal computerisnt growing In fact Intels PC revenue was lower last year than in Last quarter Intels total revenue was flat year over year as its client computing group which includes its PC and mobile businesses saw revenue decline due mostly to a drop in desktop volume And there is little reason to think PC sales are going to ramp up anytime soon There is an abundance of data indicating PCs are going to be weak for quite a while First global PC shipments fell in the first quarter according to tech research firm Gartner The company notes slowing corporate spending as the key factor and Gartner now expects PC sales to decline in Moreover the recent earnings report from semiconductor company Micron NASDAQ MU also signals a struggling PC industry Micron manufactures dynamic random access memory or DRAM which is used in PCs Last quarter revenue fell sequentially and year over year Microns CEO specifically cited weakness in the PC industry as the main reason for the revenue decline This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares fell on the day of Microns report To be sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making progress in two key growth areas These are data centers and the Internet of Things which grew revenue by and respectively year over year The problem is that these two areas are still dwarfed by Intels PC business Even collectively data centers and the Internet of Things represent only onethird of Intels quarterly revenue Prior to Intels recent reporting structure consolidation the PC division itself represented approximately twothirds of Intels total revenue Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has lumped together its PC business with its moneyhemorrhaging mobile business which lost a whopping billion in mobile last year up from a billion loss in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is spending a lot of money to try to get into mobile which has resulted in a cash drain Its cash and investments are now billion down from billion at the same point last year Going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is deploying even more cash by turning to MA to try to buy growth with its billion acquisition of Altera NASDAQ ALTR This merger makes sense strategically With Alteras fieldprogrammable gate array or FPGA technology it will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to enhance its position in data centers and the Internet of Things which are good things But this acquisition didnt come cheap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is paying per share for Altera which is about times Alteras trailing earnings per share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm offer similar valuations as both stocks trade for about times forward earnings estimates And both stocks dividends yield right now But to me the valuation and yield snapshots dont look deep enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm offer similar yields but Qualcomm will quickly surpass <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because of its rapid dividend growth Qualcomm has increased its dividend by per year over the past five years Meanwhile Intels fiveyear dividend CAGR clocks in at just More recently its dividend growth has really slowed Prior to Intels recent dividend raise the company had gone more than two years without increasing its dividend Its huge buyout of Altera will be hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to swallow and as a result I dont expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to raise its dividend for another year or two like last time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm are going in different directions While Qualcomm is firmly entrenched in mobile a growth industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to be chained to the PC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does have some strong growth areas but without a recovery in its core business it will be very hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to grow both earnings and dividends Source Why Investors Should Buy Qualcomm Instead Of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Disclosure
