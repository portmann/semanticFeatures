showcased several applications of IoT that involved location tracking Their incorporation of chipbased location tracking technology shows the significance of location tracking in the nascent Internet of Things and wearable markets The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Q report showed strong growth to come in the Internet of Things embedded CPU area The company reported that their server CPU revenue rose lower than the expected and PCmobile revenue fell but that IoT revenue rose by While IoT revenue is an order of magnitude less than the other two areas its place as third on the list shows its strategic importance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>It has been less than two weeks since Intels strong focus on IoT Internet of Things was made clear at the Consumer Electronics Show CES Intels keynote address featured demonstration after demonstration of exciting electronics with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips inside Drones robots wearable computing and advanced user interfaces were clearly the image that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wanted to paint of its future This is a big transition from their traditional focus on PCs and servers Most of Intels IoT projects are carried out in partnership with other companies in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides the chips and their expertise and other companies integrate the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips with their own component technologies and develop the products One such example is the NineBot robot which used two wheel balancing technology acquired from Segway to produce a verticallystanding robot that uses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips for vision processing and information processing But in many cases Intels partner companies and their technology details are kept secret One of Intels demonstrations was an air band that drummed and played music in the air without instruments but wearing wristbands that tracked their hand movements and translated those movements into music The processing was handled by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips but no information was released about the technology used to track the wristband movements While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does have chips for indoor location tracking they are designed for mobile devices and do not deliver the realtime performance and accuracy needed for the airband demonstration It was just announced that Intels airband demo used wireless location tracking chips from Dublinbased DecaWave DecaWave sells chips and embeddable components based on UltraWideband UWB radio that can track chip locations to within cm More important than accuracy is the speed of update the DecaWave chips update location calculations between times per second and times per second depending on the configuration The chips also support wireless communication over the same radio waves used for location positioning Whether and how UWBbased location positioning enters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips remains to be seen What is clear however is the increasing interest in location tracking in Internet of Things wearable and other electronic devices At CES chipbased location technology appeared in smart cars robots drones remote controls and more All the major chip companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Broadcom NASDAQ BCOM Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM InvenSense NYSE INVN STMicroelectronics NYSE STM and others are developing chipbased location technology some are oriented toward mobile and some toward electronic devices The next time you are moving around and using electronic devices whether drumming in the air or taking a selfie think about how things would be if electronic devices could follow your movements quickly and precisely Which chip companies will give location awareness to our electronics Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
