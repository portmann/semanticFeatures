Apple has become one of the worlds largest semiconductor companies Apples semiconductor prowess will make it possible to build ARMbased Macs at lower cost and higher margin than with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside Often overlooked by Apple NASDAQ AAPL bears is the fact that Apple has become one of the largest semiconductor makers in the world Apples custom systems on chip SOCs power all its iOS devices and represent a billion business on its own More importantly Apple has created a technical discriminator that devices with commodity ARM NASDAQ ARMH processors have had difficulty matching The future of Apples semiconductor business is bright as it forges SOCs to rival Intels best The volume of Apples chip business is one that all but a few chipmakers would envy Based on only iOS devices iPhone iPad iPod Touch Apple is selling s of millions of SOCs a year This doesnt include other Apple products such as iPod Apple TV or the many smaller supplemental chips that carry the Apple brand that can be found in its mobile devices The chart below shows the unit volume growth over the past five fiscal years Note that Apples fiscal year starts in October so doesnt include the explosive growth in iPhones of the fiscal Q December quarter Its not easy assigning a dollar value to Apples chip business because Apple doesnt provide a cost breakdown for its devices of course Theres wide divergence in the cost estimate for Apples latest SOCs IHS provides an estimate of for the AX and M motion coprocessor in the iPad Air While Techinsights estimate of the cost for the smaller and less capable A SOC in the iPhone is For purposes of getting a ballpark value of equivalent revenue from Apples SOC business I settled on an ASP of This is consistent with the estimated cost for typical ARM SOCs In the chart below I rank semiconductor companies by revenue in fiscal including Apple Here I used MarketWatch as the source of revenue data for the companies listed The list of companies in the chart is by no means an exhaustive list of chipmakers but includes the major companies involved with making SOCs or embedded processors Apples billion equivalent revenue is just the ASP multiplied by the million unit shipments of fiscal More important than the size of Apples chip business is its rate of growth which far exceeds the industry average In the chart below I plot the percent change of Apples equivalent SOC revenue compared to an Industry Average of the companies listed in the previous chart excluding Apple In addition I include the annual revenue of Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Qualcomm had the fastest growing revenue of the chipmakers I listed while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>paced the Industry Average Once again data is from MarketWatch Apples growth in SOCs for its iOS devices has allowed it to invest in design innovations at the SOC level Apple introduced the first bit processor for smartphones and tablets A in These are only now being matched by Qualcomms series and the Samsung OTCSSNLF Exynos xxx series being introduced in the latest flagship Android smartphones Apples SOCs and other bit ARM SOCs have not merely become the best performing ARM SOCs but can challenge Intels best mobile SOCs as well This was brought home to me by the recent release of the MacBook with Retina Display which uses an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CoreMY processor The Core M is fabricated on Intels most advanced nm node and runs without a cooling fan in the new MacBook Although the MacBook hasnt been tested yet its CoreM processor has been benchmarked in a Windows device the Lenovo Yoga Pro Whats interesting is that it has about the same performance on Geekbench as the AX in the iPad Air Think about what this means The AX is fabricated on a less advanced nm process nonFinFET Despite the process difference the area of the AX of mm is smaller than the area of the silicon separate chips on a circuit card package of the Core M at mm Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt reveal pricing information on the Core M Apples SOC is almost certainly less expensive by virtue of the smaller chip area the simpler packaging and the less advanced process So Apple is now able to equal the performance of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core architecture chip at lower cost Its a testimony to the power of the ARM bit architecture as well as Apples custom processor design The performance of the AX also suggests that the next series of Apple SOCs which are expected to be fabricated on Samsungs nm process will exceed the performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>These next generation SOCs will be significantly smaller and lower power but more capable than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core M They will probably be less expensive as well Apple could have easily based the new MacBook on its own SOCs rather than the Core M if not for other considerations such as app compatibility If it had the MacBook would have been even lighter and thinner since the logic board would have been smaller about the size of whats in the iPad Air The ARMbased MacBook would probably have been less expensive as well Apples control of the Mac OS and iOS ecosystems its growing prowess as a semiconductor maker and its Xcode developer tools give it the ability to port Mac OS to ARM with minimal disruption Apples ability to build lowercost ARM SOCs with equal or better performance than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes the economic imperative clear Apple will be able to build Mac OS devices at lower cost and better performance with its own SOCs inside These ARMbased Macs will also be lower retail cost higher margins a winwin for Apple and consumers Up until now Ive been cautious about this issue saying that I dont think Apple has made a decision yet I believed that the key milestone would be successful production of the next Apple SOC series at nm That production has almost certainly begun based on Samsungs impending release of the Galaxy S which uses its nm Exynos SOC With the passing of this critical gate Apples decision to move on from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is straightforward even obvious I expect the first ARMbased Macs to appear in Source Apple Becoming A Semiconductor Powerhouse Disclosure
