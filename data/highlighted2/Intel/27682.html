Seeking Alpha Qualcomm is fabless while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>spends B per year on CAPEX For decades <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has been the heavyweight champion of the computer CPU market Starting with the IBM NYSE IBM PC and continuing through today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has dominated what I call the immobile market and has an enviable record of vanquishing competitors such as AMD NASDAQ AMD But in the new world of mobile new competitors have shown up and in some cases have vanquished the previous indomitable champion Perhaps the most competitive has been Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM In this article I compare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with Qualcomm and see if the capo di capo of the CPU neighborhood will still be the dominate player going forward Qualcomms concentration on mobile markets puts it in the most dynamic and fastest growing chip markets Its Snapdragon line of ARM chips commands the mobile phone market with over billion android phones shipped with Snapdragon It also dominates the LTE modem business a market where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has only a share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand recently announced that Q sales would be down approximately B because of weaker than expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>desktop CPUs represent the largest and most profitable product line roughly of sales B of B total and of Operating profit If you include Intels mobile chip contrarevenue fiasco its an even higher percentage So when the PC Client Group sneezes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gets pneumonia Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is overly dependent on the stagnant market for desktop PCs Advantage QCOM with profitable sales in growth markets their sales are likely to grow faster than INTC Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm are entering each others markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to manufacture competitive LTE modems but so far has had little success per the above chart This is a brutal market with both Texas Instruments and Broadcom dropping out of the modem market due to losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>competes more successfully with Qualcomm in the tablet market although only with B in contrarevenue losses Whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will ever make a significant profit in the tablet market is still a very big question mark Meantime Qualcomm has announced a new server chip aimed directly at Intels other long time profit center server chips Its Data Center Group generated more than B in profit in up from Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has already ported Windows server to ARM processors and if that becomes permanent then this is another highmargin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>product that will come under attack Even without the Windows port a QCOM server chip will steal sales from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the Linux server market which is of server sales Advantage QCOM with entry into the high sales price high margin server chip market QCOM may be the first real competitor to INTCs hugely successful Data Center Group INTC on the other hand must somehow make contrarevenue go away before it can make money in QCOMs market Intels huge CAPEX versus Qualcomms fabless production <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>invests huge amounts of money for CAPEX and RD In it was over B combined QCOM on the other hand outsources production to almost a dozen different manufacturers while maintaining a similar percentage of sales for RD QCOM believes this approach is less risky and preserves cash for things other than CAPEX As QCOM CEO Steve Mollenkopf said at the analysts day in November But that is not the only edge that Qualcomm has As the companys top brass pointed out at its analyst day this week it will manufacture about billion chips in and it has relationships with different foundries Samsung TSMC GlobalFoundries SMIC UMC Amkor ASE Group SPIL StatsChipPAC and UTAC using over different process technologies Advantage QCOM although for the very latest technology INTC has an advantage but they must turn that advantage into profits In this chart we can see the dramatic increase in revenues for QCOM vs INTC Of course INTC was starting at a much higher level and would not be expected to have sales increases as high as a smaller competitor Advantage QCOM faster sales growth should result in more RD dollars and more rapid stock price appreciation INTC may be able to turn their IP into more profits but the question is when and by how much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is famous for its RD spending but QCOM exceeds it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is known for spending huge amounts on Research and Development and does that to maintain its lead in IP and the latest technology for producing the best chips However as the following chart shows QCOM is also an aggressive RD spender which is why it is able to maintain its lead in several mobile markets Advantage neither Looks like a neck and neck horse race to me When it comes to gross margin QCOM is the leader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>rightly brags about its concentration on gross margin and over the years has managed to keep it high enough to fund its huge CAPEX and RD budget But as you can clearly see on the following chart QCOM has done even better over the last few years and in addition does not have to fund a huge CAPEX budget However the chart also shows INTC exceeding QCOMs margin in and also shows QCOMs margin has been consistently shrinking One reason QCOMs margins are high is its high level of licensing revenue a source that needs RD but not expensive fabs Note Source of all charts marketwatch data author design Advantage Neither Looks too close to call but QCOM needs to get their margins back up When it comes to Mr Market QCOM is much better liked Over the last year time period QCOM shares have outperformed INTC by a large margin In fact INTC is below the Dow Jones Semiconductor Index for the same period while QCOM has marginally exceeded it PE ratios are close at x for QCOM and X for INTC Both also pay good dividends at and respectively and both are paying out about of earnings in dividends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is more reliant on older product lines desktop and server chips for their profits than QCOM Certainly desktops are vulnerable to slow downs as the first quarter showed and INTC is betting big on D NAND and an end to contrarevenue to fuel a profit turnaround Their chances in the modem market seem slim to me and I dont think anything is going to match the margins they have historically seen in desktops and servers One area with potentially big sales and margins is D NAND but it will most likely be before the volume is enough to make a real difference QCOM on the other hand is also facing new competition with Samsung threatening to go with their own chip the Exynos for new phones This would cut out a large portion of Snapdragon sales But QCOM is in all the new markets and I think has an advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>everywhere but in the traditional <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>markets although it may soon be knocking on Intels door with their new server line If MSFT ports Windows to ARM processors then I think QCOM will thrive taking market share from INTC I would not rate either QCOM or INTC a buy at this point but if COMs price falls under or INTCs under then I would reconsider One could easily argue that Micron NASDAQ MU with a PE of is the best positioned since they will sell memory to both chip giants markets as well as Apples and maybe Samsungs And of course if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is successful in D NAND then Micron will be also as the Joint Venture partner of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Versus Qualcomm Whos The Chip Champ Going
