Years Of Magical Thinking The NAND Industry Confronts The Problem Of Demand Growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Dramatically increased NAND demand growth is crucial for industry profitability NAND demand is elastic is a useless catch phrase that conceals the truly important factors that influence demand Only marketing investments in customers and partners will enable industry suppliers to understand the true dimensions of risk and opportunity in the NAND business Magical thinking is a form of reasoning that learns causative relationships through correlation alone Science and the scientific method are designed to elucidate causal relationships through careful controlled experiments magical thinking given a correlation with an observed effect pulls a causation out of thin air We look at the NAND business as a business that can have significant growth but also has some interesting demand elasticity properties Mark Durcan Credit Suisse Technology Conference Dec we think with D it will be the tipping point that will eventually allow the PC space to convert to SSDs SA Transcripts Microns Ernie Maddock Raymond James Technology Conference In the last two articles we have taken a hard look at the NAND business in and beyond We have concluded that Micron NASDAQ MU will see only a little benefit from the business in but can potentially harvest revenue and profit gains in and beyond if demand growth exceeds <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is in much better shape because of its dominance of the data center Because of that dominant position <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely see strong revenue and profit gains in and beyond into and assuming adequate demand growth Depending on the overall market conditions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a strong position to be the primary beneficiary of the innovative and costleading D NAND technology that the IM partners are now bringing to market But what will those market conditions be Questions regarding the economic viability of this new generation of D NAND product inevitably devolve to the question of demand It would seem obvious that for a market aspiring to overall revenue and profit growth demand growth must exceed the rise in productivity In this case if the capacity increases in the new D technology fall in the per year range overall market demand must exceed that level for there to be gross margin expansion As we have seen however market growth forecasts from Samsung OTCSSNLF Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>diverge sharply with only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>projecting explosive growth specifically a tripling of the TAM B over the next three years How can Samsung Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>look at the same world and Samsung project just YOY growth through the end of the decade Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>project a tripling of the TAM to B in Think about that for the moment Its not as if these forecasts are coming from some pieinthesky think tank guru though those forecasts differ greatly as well These forecasts are coming from the industry itself from the people who one would have to think are closest to the ground as it were who have the most to gain and the most to lose These guys have a major skin in the game Intels forecast has the virtue of being congruent with its view that NAND and D XPoint are paradigmshifting technologies whose demand profiles vary on a predictable basis as expressed in Geoffrey Moores Crossing the Chasm formulation Ergo In Intels formulation marks the point of inflection when demand ramps sharply with the early majority buyers adopting the technology One thing seems to be true both Samsung and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are acting as if they believe their projections Samsung has delayed the second phase of the Xian plant expansion and has doubled down on a highend SSD client strategy with its series announcement centered on its NVMe controllers Intels Dalian announcement is perfectly congruent with its bullish strategy and is politically convenient to boot What are we to make of this Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are now united in their confident view of their emerging product advantage but part ways regarding overall market growth projections Western Digital NASDAQ WDC must think that D NAND has potential surely it is not buying into Samsungs market forecast in making what is perceived to be a rich offer for SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK Another bullish indicator the latest market data from Seagate NASDAQ STX seems to support the idea that the market is finally reaching an inflection point with SSD sales negatively impacting the sale of highend HDDs If you take the time to read the various projections of NAND demand growth you will find many different opinions and shades of emphasis on the subject but there is one thing that almost everybody ex <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to agree on NAND demand is elastic What is meant by this term is that demand will vary with price In one way or another every prognosticator will link various levels of cost declines to increased NAND adoption Confession I have been guilty of this as well over the years The holy grail of this analysis is crossover that time when the cost per bit of raw NAND becomes less than an HDD bit Until that happy day arrives it is universally agreed that NAND demand will be driven by displacing HDD in highend applications the K and K drives where HDD bits are relatively more dear due the derating that occurs to improve the performance of the drives Even in this area the justification is wrapped in a Total Cost of Ownership TCO analysis that implies that SSDs are worth the investment only on a dollarfordollar cost replacement perspective Heres a typical graphic seen in many of these projections from Gartner Micron is particularly fond of the NAND is elastic thesis In one way or another we hear the elastic argument being made in every major presentation Unfortunately for us investors who are trying to fathom the opportunities and risks in Microns business MU has never been good at explaining exactly how its business will benefit from future NAND cost reductions This is particularly annoying these days because it is trumpeting its supposed D NAND cost advantage over its competitors Micron has company No one it seems has any idea of how much demand will vary with price There is a very good reason for this It doesnt Welcome to the world of magical thinking On the contrary NAND bit demand increases are a dizzyingly complex function of multiple factors encompassing flash form function and density advances industry competition dynamics and business model technology packaging innovation application software function and age company IT culture the pace of industry standards the pace of price declines in hard drives and finally costprice advances in NAND itself Let me be clear Im not saying that price is not a factor it certainly is Price reductions of NAND flash appliances certainly are a good thing What Im saying is there are so many other factors which are more important than acquisition price that price per se is a very poor indicator Bottom line demand is not so much elastic but eclectic and costprice declines are simply one factor of many that determine overall demand patterns and growth Price alone is not a terribly good metric for modeling demand changes No better example of this magical thinking is Mr Maddocks comment quoted above that D cost improvements will mean that the days of HDD in PCs and other client devices are numbered Why should this be so when hard drive innovations are maintaining the cost ratio of HDDs to SSDs at a factor centering on to on a costbit basis Do you follow Western Digital or Seagate If so you have probably seen this slide a great many times Lately there have been some detractors most notably Toshiba OTCPKTOSYY that doubt the ability of the HDD industry to continue to innovate at the CAGR rate shown above but this doesnt really change the overall strategic cost differential situation through the balance of the decade HDD Gb has relative to NAND flash remained stubbornly consistent over the years at roughly to and that situation is changing very slowly So how is it again that price elasticity is driving NAND demand growth Now let me be the first to say that the fact that Maddock is using magical thinking doesnt necessarily mean hes wrong Despite the ongoing price differential I believe Maddock is mostly right My MacBook is configured with SSD and there is no way I would ever go back to HDD But my decision has nothing to do with price PCs will eventually ditch spinning rust but the reason that will happen has much more to do with IT model changes the cloud requiring less local storage and device maker design and packaging innovation lighter and thinner and more durable matters more than capacity than cost Once we move from client devices to the data center we enter a whole new realm of adoption rationale Here again acquisition price is simply a smoke screen In this realm TCO Total Cost of Ownership rules the acquisition process And here again we are entirely dependent on the specific use case in a specific industry within an individual corporate IT culture Bear with me while I use an outrageous analogy that hopefully will bring this discussion into sharp focus Lets assume for a moment that companies are in the freight hauling business and need to make a capital acquisition to haul the freight Companies find that they are being offered two fundamental choices They can buy a dray wagon pulled by a sixhorse team an HDD or they can invest in a dieselpowered tractortrailer the SSD We will stipulate that the new diesel rig is x the investment cost of the alternative Our companies face a decision they can stick with the dray wagon approach or they can go with a new stateoftheart dieselpowered tractortrailer Now from a pure technology perspective this analogy is unfair to NAND but be that as it is lets follow through with it On one level the decision is easy The dray wagonhorse combo is X less expensive from a cost of acquisition standpoint So its clear right Our metaphorical companies will always buy the dray wagon There are in fact some use cases we can imagine where buying the dray wagon is a rational choice Maybe Im only hauling the freight miles and my customers dont particularly care when it arrives In the IT realm archiving is an analogous activity Upfront cost rules the acquisition logic Hard drives win GB stored is the ruling metric Lets say however that I want to change or augment my business model and offer freight service to more distant customers who care greatly about speed and flexibility of service In this realm the rules of the game have changed and all of a sudden there are many more factors to consider than the simple cost of acquisition This is the world where our metaphorical diesel conveyance shows its value Taking this one step further in the case where our adventurous customer has decided to expand his business to points distant from his current market let us now imagine the acquisition competition between the dray wagon and tractortrailer salesmen Currently the price between the two is compared to The tractortrailer sales rep hearing from noted industry consultants that tractortrailer demand is elastic goes to his customer and says proudly that he has dropped his price to If we are to believe the industry gurus who ceaselessly plot the cost decline curves in storage this price drop is determinative The tractortrailer sales guy will win the deal based on his new lower prices It is clear how ridiculous this is Hopefully I have not offended you with this simpleminded analogy but I think this brings the demand question into sharp perspective In the example above the customer could care less about the price differential between the two choices His decision is driven solely by his businesscomputing model and his desire to change it in order to take advantage of the opportunities that are afforded by the change The second and third order effects of the decision relate more to revenue and profit than cost On the one hand the customer can stick with his old business model and buy the less expensive alternative or he can take advantage of a highly value added transformation in his business that is directly facilitated by his choice of the tractortrailer Price has nothing to do with it This is exactly the position that NAND is in todays business and IT environment Indeed I argue that by the time the second generation of D NAND arrives in volume in this computing model transition will happen regardless of the ongoing price decreases Which in any case are being matched by HDD So does acquisition price never matter Of course not Im not privy to studies that show conclusively what applications NAND has been used for but we have broad anecdotal evidence that the fertile ground for NAND has been hot data meaning those applications generally IOPS intensive that are very sensitive to latency Because IOPS is a more useful metric these applications are highly value added and HDD companies have bent over backward to accommodate the liabilities of hard drives by shortstroking them and offering k RPM drives that can offer approximately ms of latency best case in service to the application In our cartoonish example above imagine a new class of customers a very small class in our town miles away and the dray wagon manufacturers responding with a new type of smaller lighter wagons They cant carry as much freight but our horse teams can pull them fast enough to meet a few customer requirements Enter our SSD sales rep who now responds with a tractortrailer that is slower and less reliable than the previous model think TLC but can still carry more freight on faster round trips It is here that price matters The customer is still in the same business no paradigms have been changed He is still in the same mile HDD box Before we leave this simpleminded analogy let me acknowledge that there are several other good reasons to buy a dray wagon over the tractortrailer One of the most important of these has to do with state of the road infrastructure Lets imagine the decision is being made in an environment where there are no roads beyond our mile box Our NAND tractortrailer doesnt do us much good there does it Taking this one step further lets imagine a customer who wants to enter the overnight package delivery business and equate D XPoint to a freighter Lets now stipulate that in our mythical world there are few airports with runways strong enough to handle the plane This is the situation for prospective buyers of D XPoint within the current software model And here again the decision the buyer makes has very little to do with price The central factor delaying the shift from HDD to NAND and beyond to other types of nonvolatile memory NVM like D XPoint is the yearold von Neumann computing model a corollary of which is that memory is fast storage is slow Not only have three generations of IT folks grown up in this paradigm but also almost all of the existing software system and application has been written by developers who have that tenet tattooed on their brain The new generation of storage class memory like D XPoint is the metaphorical equivalent of our freighthauling business hearing that a whole new world has been discovered beyond that town miles away Suddenly an uncharted universe of opportunity has been revealed All they have to do is abandon the dray wagon and horses and invest in these newfangled tractortrailers and jet freighters It is literally that extreme a change And yet that is what is happening And yeah you guessed it Price has nothing to do with it I hope that makes sense Just as it does in so many aspects of life leaving magical thinking behind exposes us to the reality of our situation with all its risks and opportunities I believe this ongoing disjoint between magical thinking and current reality explains the chaos evident in the forecasts Reality is clearly so much more complicated than singlefactor price is determinative magical thinking To the extent that there is rough consensus at CAGR Gartner IDC Micron SanDisk it is as if our forecasters are blindfolded and given the job of identifying the elephant have groped aimlessly and inconclusively until congregating at the elephants trunk where they find they are in general agreement We are relieved to hear that the bulk of them are unanimous in their opinion that it is a snake One has to wonder if the NAND demand forecast they have agreed upon is any closer to the truth Now lets be clear about one thing Im not saying that all industry forecasters are in the thrall of magical thinking Indeed that is why I think we see such variability in many of the forecasts Im saying that up until recently Micron has been and it has encouraged us investors to be as well Why is that I believe it is because it has retained its engineeringdriven business culture I can hear the protests now from our friends in Boise who will point to numerous slides and commentary on how the company has evolved from being purely product driven to recognizing that the memory market has evolved to be more specialized and use casemarket specific And indeed Micron has tailored its DRAM business to be more market specific NAND is a whole nother animal however and it is here that its lack of investment in marketing resources has caused it no end of grief See exhibit the ongoing planar NAND TLC debacle Its engineeringdriven culture has yet to make the needed transition to being marketing driven and this has blinded it to market needs I have written about this topic before and I encourage you to read it because it will provide much more context for this important subject The key point to be made is that there is only one way for Micron to completely free itself from the perils of its NAND magical thinking and that is to invest in its customers and partners who use and make a business from its NAND product It must become a marketingdriven company The good news here is that it has begun to make this vital transformation The best evidence of that we have seen to date is the recent webinar given from its new Austin Storage Innovation Center While the production values of this event could have been much better the content was spot on Micron invested in this center to provide a working laboratory for understanding real world customer and partner opportunities in converting applications and operating environments from HDD to SSD Its stated objective reducing risk and complexity while increasing predictability and performance in the enterprises transition from HDD to NAND flash and other forms of NVM Here customers and partners can find a safe and convenient environment to explore the benefits of the new datacentric computing paradigm This is exactly what is needed to reassure the slowmoving hyperconservative IT management teams whose first instinct on hearing of our new metaphorical world beyond the mile box they live in is to cower in the corner and mumble darkly that there be dragons out there Much more could be written about this presentation The Next Platforms piece is excellent but one of the important elements to come out of Microns presentation is its discovery that paradigmatic change is rarely onedimensional Take for example Microns VP of Storage Solutions Eric Endebrocks description of the unexpected results that surprise you when Micron collaborates with customers to convert significant customer applications and platforms from HDD to SSD For example a NAND flash hosted Hadoop works even better in a virtualized environment than on bare metal in a single server Micron expected to show the customer better performance through the use of flash but it did not expect the virtualization benefits that come from ease of administration This is the winwin that comes from really knowing your customers and their needs Only if Micron continues down this path can it hope to build a profitable and growing business in NVM What does all this mean for the future Should we be investing in Micron <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or any of the flash producers now Hopefully Intels forecast is closer to the truth than Samsungs but lets be clear if Samsung is right with its forecast of CAGR in NAND it will make little difference how sophisticated and differentiated any companys product strategy is nobody wins by products will sell at cost and sometimes below cost If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is right everybody wins they all will make money whatever the competitive merits of their D product or NVMe controller IP But some will make more a lot more and the biggest winner of all is likely to be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>There is no bridging this gap On this point the world turns I personally cannot believe that NAND flash adoption wont reach the inflection point and growth wont accelerate to levels well above per year But I also wouldnt recommend that any one invest in any of the NAND producers based on an assumption that it will happen soon Doing so at this time requires a massive leap of faith that is simply not justified by the facts before us Im not going to do it and I wouldnt recommend that you do either Although we have some intriguing and hopeful evidence that the turn has begun it is still too early to be placing large bets on the flash market This is because will see a flood of new capacity coming to market that will drown the industry in excess capacity if demand does not ramp up significantly above CAGR This is the dreaded nuclear winter scenario that observers like Jim Handy have predicted for and It is to that topic that I will turn in my next article Demand must rise as we exit calendar One thing for sure The move to accelerated NAND flash adoption will not be gated by acquisition price or ruled by GB metrics as the NAND is elastic catch phrase implies The dragons we fear that lurk beyond our HDD box are not dragons at all they are opportunities for increased revenues and profits that come from new business and operating models that are derived from the enhanced agility capability and speed that NAND and new generations of NVM offer Investing in customers is the only way that Micron and the other flash providers can get a firmer handle on the true dimensions of NAND demand Micron has begun to do this We can only hope that its efforts build rapidly on the Austin initiative It will end up spending more on the SGA expense line but the return in materially higher margins will be worth it I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking
