class='textDiv'>Qualcomm The Looming Alliance With Google Qualcomm Inc NASDAQQCOM Seeking Alpha According to Bloomberg Qualcomms ARM server processors may be used by Google in its data centers Google could serve as a major customer for Qualcomm since it buys processors every quarter for its data centers It was only last month when I speculated that Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM server joint venture in China could pave the way for similar joint ventures with major Cloud service providers such as Alphabets Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebook NASDAQ FB Bloomberg reported that Google is engaged in a partnership with Qualcomm to use its server chip in Google data centers This could be the start of an even more extensive alliance between the two companies My recent article on Intels efforts in data center networking received a comment to the effect that server processors featuring ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH architecture were totally unsuited for data center use Ive often seen such sweeping generalizations on Intels NASDAQ INTC behalf such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will dominate mobile devices and ARM foundries will never develop nm FinFET processes Neither assertion has proved correct Apparently Google disagrees with the assertion about ARM suitability in the data center as well According to the Bloomberg article Google is taking Qualcomms server offerings very seriously cooperating on design work and committing to using the processors if they meet expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls would have us believe that the data center remains a secure bastion for x processors and I even believed this for a while myself A couple of factors have served to persuade me otherwise The first is the mounting evidence that x is inherently cost disadvantaged compared to ARM assuming equivalent performance This view is substantiated by the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors have achieved no meaningful penetration of the smartphone market In lightweight tablets Intels market penetration has only been achieved through contra revenue subsidies This is further corroborated by comparison testing of the Apple NASDAQ AAPL Ax processor with the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake Core M processor performed in Anandtechs review of the iPad Pro Overall with graphics performance included the processors were very comparable in performance Estimated costs for the A processor in the iPhone s run about Probably the cost of the larger Ax would be more But this is far less than Intels asking price for the Core MY of The other key factor arguing on behalf of ARM in the data center is Qualcomms recently announced joint venture with the government of Guizhou Province in the Peoples Republic of China The joint venture will design and build server processors using Qualcomm intellectual property as well as build a cloud services center in the province Qualcomms selling directly to a cloud services provider has the benefit of circumventing one of the major stumbling blocks to ARM processor adoption which has been commercial software stack maturity A commercial cloud provider such as Google has complete control of their internal cloud software and with the appropriate investment can insure that the stack runs on the ARM platform As described in the Bloomberg article the large cloud providers also manufacture their own hardware designing their systems down to the board level Both Google and Facebook are known to do this Bloomberg states that Google buys processors every quarter for its server manufacturing operation and accounts for of processor shipments So these companies can provide a huge market for processors just based on their internal needs The fact that Google is so interested also tends to confirm the potential cost advantage of ARM over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Cost effectiveness has always been something that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls have tended to overlook They have focused on technology advantages that were exclusive to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and not considered cost The x vs ARM performance debate was entirely moot The fact that there wasnt a significant performance discriminator between the architectures wasnt as important as the performancecost ratio Ive also pointed to another area of potential partnership between Google and Qualcomm This has to do with reports that Google has been seeking a chip partner to codesign systems on chip SOCs for Android smartphones and tablets This is in response to the growing trend among smartphone makers such as Apple Samsung OTCSSNLF Huawei and LG to design custom SOCs rather than buy off the shelf units from commodity suppliers such as Qualcomm or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>These custom SOCs have generally been higher performance and more profitable for the mobile device makers Controlling both the operating system and the hardware design as Apple does affords it the opportunity to optimize the design of both for a better integrated more efficient and more useful system I believe this is precisely the advantage that Google seeks through the hardware partnership Qualcomm is probably the best suited as Googles partner Qualcomms SOCs are already the de facto standard in the Android world And Qualcomm has to some degree suffered on account of the paradigm shift spearheaded by Apple and Samsung Cooperation between Qualcomm and Google is a natural and mutually beneficial adaptation to the paradigm shift by both companies The Bloomberg report is not quite enough for investors to take to the bank but it does claim that the partnership will be announced next week That announcement could come at Qualcomms Analyst Meeting on February I continue to be very impressed by Qualcomms Snapdragon SOC and wireless expertise and decidedly unimpressed by Intels efforts in mobile and wireless But Qualcomms guidance for a yy revenue decline for the March quarter illustrates that it still has an uphill struggle to maintain and expand its dominance of the commodity ARM processor market For that reason Im still a little cautious maintaining a hold rating on the stock Ill certainly revisit this after next week I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated
