</span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will consolidate its PC group and its mobile group into a single reporting segment However this does not actually change the fundamental questions surrounding the viability of Intels mobile strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to lose billions of dollars in mobile The company is targeting million in increased mobile profits this year without offering much in the way of specifics Without a more concrete strategy to profitably enter the mobile space Im content to stay on the sidelines and not buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>just yet Over the past few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has struggled to fight off criticism regarding its mobile strategy As the worlds largest semiconductor company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>dominates the personal computer industry Indeed the PC constitutes almost twothirds of the companys total sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>unquestionably has a leadership position in the PC market and as a result the company is highly profitable and generates strong cash flow On the other hand however PC shipments arent growing And because of its heavy reliance on PCs that means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>isnt growing much either In fact Intels PC revenue was lower in than in Moreover Intels diluted EPS was lower in than in This underscores the problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is facing in the smartphone era Of course the natural remedy to this should have been penetration into the mobile market since it stands to reason thats where the growth is and will remain so going forward Throughout this challenging period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management has maintained that it has a viable mobile plan But this hasnt materialized at least not in a meaningful way Intels mobile strategy essentially amounts to shipping high volumes of devices at a loss which is unsustainable The company recently announced it would change its reporting structure to combine its mobile division with its much larger PC group Intels Concerning Mobile Strategy Or Lack Thereof The problems facing Intels mobile ambitions are well documented At the beginning of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich vowed to get Intels chips into million tablets by the end of the year to finally demonstrate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was more than a PC chip company To be fair <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>actually succeeded on its goal and then some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>actually shipped million tablets last year But volume alone isnt the only concern Profitability also matters and in that regard Intels mobile strategy still misses the mark <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>lost billion in mobile last year up from a billion loss in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>only shipped as many tablets as it did because it offered device manufacturers massive cost concessions to take its chips This practice created contrarevenue that destroyed profitability Believe it or not Intels mobile segment actually produced negative revenue in the fourth quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has spent a great deal of money without getting much in return Cash on hand at the end of totaled billion down from nearly billion in the span of two years This is obviously a big problem and what concerns me is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>hasnt adequately addressed it The company maintains it can improve profitability by million in its mobile operations this year although its unclear exactly how it will accomplish this Intels most recent announcement was that it will combine its PC and mobile operating segments going forward From now on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will report results for its Client Computing Group in addition to its Data Centers and Internet of Things businesses Im not sure how this reorganization actually changes things Intels problems in mobile wont simply go away On this topic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has said that the structural change is due to the blending of PC and mobile computing in society That may be true but this move still seems more like an attempt to mask whats going on in the mobile division to make it easier to evade investor scrutiny I owned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares for several years I first bought in the low s because at that time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>traded for a very cheap valuation and was a yielder <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>rallied considerably and I sold my shares for around per share Ive been out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for almost a year and since I admire the companys strong business and its brand Ive been looking for an opportunity to get back in However the events that have unfolded over the past several months pertaining to Intels growth strategy have compelled me to stay on the sidelines The stock has run up which has expanded its valuation and lowered its dividend yield but its fundamentals have not improved all that much In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still doesnt have a convincing plan for entering the mobile space and without that its hard to see how the company will return to meaningful growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares have come down from its week high in recent weeks which leads me to believe the market is once again reconsidering Intels growth strategy Earnings are coming soon and if the company disappoints I wouldnt be surprised to see the stock fall back below per share While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generates strong cash flow and offers a solid yield Im content to hold off from buying the stock until it either returns to its week low or it demonstrates it has a viable longterm mobile strategy Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Changing Its Reporting Structure Raises More Questions Than Answers Disclosure The
