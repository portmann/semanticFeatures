style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced the acquisition of Recon Instruments a maker of smart glasses based on ARM processor technology Along with Alteras ARM based SOCs Recon gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>even more presence in the ARM device market With the purchase of Recon Instruments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC now becomes an ARM mobile device manufacturer Recon Instruments makes smart glassesgoggles for sports and skiing using ARM Holdingsbased NASDAQ ARMH processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is being drawn however unwillingly into the ARM sphere of influence Intels announcement of the purchase makes clear that it will attempt to steer recon in the direction of using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture devices developed specifically for the wearable market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also offered the assurance that Recon would continue selling enhancing and marketing their products under the Recon brand without disruption As with the Altera acquisition I recently profiled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to want to walk a fine line On the one hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>professes that the newly acquired company will have independence in choice of processor technology while on the other it assumes that Intels processors will be chosen on their own merits Left unaddressed is what might happen if Altera or Recon decide to continue with the ARM architecture It would be easy to assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would simply mandate the use of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors and thats probably true What Im not convinced of is that those processors will be based on the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture By way of explaining this opinion let me back up a moment and clarify my stance on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Following the Altera article I saw a lot of comments that misrepresented to put it politely my views on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The most common misrepresentation was a simpleminded assertion Mark thinks everything ARM is great and everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is st The ridiculousness of the assertion is apparent to me as I sit here writing this on my Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>PC one of the many Ive put together over the years My negativity about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is confined to Intels current management which I think has misread the opportunity in mobile devices Intels public position is that mobile devices including wearables represent an opportunity to extend the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture into very low power mobile applications <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has proclaimed that everything is best with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside I doubt that this is true This opinion is based on a set of observations over the past couple of years that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been trying to break into the mobile device market These observations constitute admittedly circumstantial evidence but I consider them persuasive in their totality The first observation has to do with price competitiveness Over the course of Intels mobile device division lost billion dollars apparently due to contrarevenue subsidies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shipped million tablet processors in exceeding its goal of million for the year But even then it hardly achieved dominance of the tablet market in which million units were shipped in according to IDC Apple NASDAQ AAPL alone despite a sales decline sold million tablets in all of which used Apples custom designed ARM processors Intels experience in suggested to me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture was profoundly cost disadvantaged relative to ARM Moreover process node leadership which arguably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still maintains was not sufficient to overcome the cost disadvantage Architecture Differences Driving Cost Competitiveness The second observation has to do with the most likely explanation for the cost disadvantage Theres a fundamental difference between ARM architecture and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture xx having to do with how the processors handle the numeric codes instructions that tell the processor what to do In order to maintain compatibility with the x instruction set which goes back to the s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture employs a second layer of instructions called microcode which is what the modern <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chip really understands Theres a layer of processing in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chip that translates the x instructions into microcode The added processing for translation into microcode takes up additional real estate on the chip itself Additional chip area equals additional cost ARM architecture doesnt use microcode and therefore doesnt need the extra area for instruction decoding Instructions are directly implemented in the design of the processor This also gives ARM architecture a power efficiency advantage as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has successfully mitigated the power efficiency advantage of ARM through various onchip power saving techniques just as it has the performance impact of microcode translation But these have come at the cost of greater complexity and have effectively increased the area and cost impact of microcode translation beyond the needs of translation itself The bottom line of this set of observations is that in order to achieve the power efficiency of ARM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to add further complexity and cost to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had achieved power performance parity with ARM but it was now priced out of the mobile device market Intels solution was to try to force its way in with the contrarevenue give away Intels Mobile and Communications Group received an average of in revenue for each of the million processors it sold in This is well below the price of a typical ARM based tablet processor from the likes of Samsung The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was forced to undercut ARM so severely says much about how the mobile device industry responded to contrarevenue I think the industry understood full well what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was trying to do and why and for the most part wasnt having any of it Recon had been an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital portfolio company prior to the acquisition so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made the decision to invest in an ARM mobile device maker a couple of years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might have tried to steer Recon into using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors but wisely chose not to And may still I believe that the Altera and Recon purchases signal a shift in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>strategy The presumption that everything is best with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside has probably been severely shaken if not abandoned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is hedging its bet on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture at least when it comes to mobile devices My complaint about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in has only gotten to the point it should have been in about in terms of receptiveness to building ARM processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could design ARM processors that would be superior to any competition and it would have little trouble gaining acceptance for them among mobile device makers The Altera and Recon acquisitions suggest that it may still do so Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Becomes An ARM Mobile Device Maker
