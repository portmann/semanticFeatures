Nvidia Execution Is The Best Answer Nvidia Corporation NASDAQNVDA Seeking Alpha Nvidia has continued to execute very well in the PC gaming space and virtual reality could drive significant upgrades given the demands of the technology Taking its core expertise and using it to garner revenue from other endmarkets is crucial to the longterm thesis autos and data centers look like prime targets today Nvidia will have to grow at better than a midsingledigit rate to justify a higher DCFsupported fair value but the shares are a little undervalued in EVrevenue terms Credit where its due NVIDIA NASDAQ NVDA or Nvidia has executed a lot better over the past year than I thought it would and the shares reflect that Nvidias stock has risen close to over the past year leaving just about everybody in the dust It is to managements credit that it has driven performance to a point where concerns about the loss of licensing revenue from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and stillsignificant exposure to gaming are secondary relative to the emerging longterm opportunities in markets like virtual reality data centers deep learning and autos Clearly the company will have to maintain its execution edge and companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Advanced Micro NASDAQ AMD and Mobileye NYSE MBLY have their own growth plans that dont include letting Nvidia beat them I think Nvidia can continue to leverage its expertise in GPUs to grow and diversify the business but its hard to call the stock really cheap at these levels unless you believe auto or other markets can drive longterm doubledigit free cash flow growth from here a tall order for a company of Nvidias size but not impossible It has yet to be confirmed but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has reportedly been holding discussions with AMD about licensing its graphics technology As a reminder <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>pays Nvidia million a quarter under a deal that expires in the first quarter of Past relations between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia have certainly been contentious but I find it interesting all the same Theres no end of debate about which company has the best graphics card for PC gaming but I think it says something that there is still a debate when Nvidia has continued to take market share from AMD in both discrete desktop and mobile GPU markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could want any number of things in licensing AMDs tech <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has previously talked about GPUs being important building blocks in the data center and AMD really hasnt been involved in the data center market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could also want to improve its own graphics capabilities andor better position itself for the upcoming growth in virtual reality applications Last and by no means least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may expect future litigation from Nvidia after the current deal ends and licensing AMDs technology could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shore itself up for those fights I cant say this doesnt matter to Nvidia but at the risk of being overly dismissive towards AMD Id say that AMDs history does speak for itself Nvidia would certainly like to maintain marginrich streams of licensing revenue but it is not as though the company is dependent on that revenuecash stream While it is possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could do more with AMDs technology than AMD has managed I dont think Nvidia is going to lose a lot of sleep over the competitive ramifications of such a licensing deal That Nvidia is still getting strong growth from gaming up yoy and qoq in the last quarter when industry PC shipments are so weak is a pretty strong testament to the resilience of gaming Its also worth noting that Nvidia gets less than of that revenue from the US with China having risen to somewhere around of the market which helps explain ASUS presence as a major customer Even though gaming revenue seems to have longer legs than previously thought and management is looking for to growth over the next three years the company has nevertheless been active in diversifying itself away from that business Virtual reality is one such market and one that seems ready to ramp up relatively soon Given that the demands of virtual reality systems tend to be well beyond that of regular desktop use Ive seen estimates of graphics requirements seven times higher theres a pretty strong opportunity here for Nvidia assuming VR catches on Data centercloud acceleration and deep learning also remain promising opportunities on the enterprise side How quickly these opportunities develop is a major question but if the addressable market sizes that Nvidia management has laid out are credible the company has relatively minor share in what should be multibilliondollar opportunities over the longer term In both cases though there is going to be competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX argue that FPGAs are the way to go and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has apparently seen some good results using FPGAs while Xilinx and IBM NYSE IBM just announced a partnership in highperformance computing That said its not an allornothing situation and it quite likely that CPUs GPUs and FPGAs will all have their role to play Nvidias opportunities in the auto sector could ultimately be the largest of all There is very much an element of stop me if youve heard this one as seemingly every chip company is angling for a piece of the auto market That said Nvidia has a more credible platform than many wouldbe players given the companys existing Drive CX platform largely infotainment its Drive PX platform and the Drive PX platform autonomous driving that it showcased at the most recent CES in January The Drive PX is no joke with two Tegra processors and two discrete GPUs but Im curious if they can sell this at a digestible price to auto OEMs and still make attractive margins Its also well worth noting that there are going to be a lot of competing efforts including Mobileyes Road Experience Management system and Texas Instruments NYSE TXN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have made it clear that they intend to be involved in the market as well This market opportunity is very new though and Im frankly at a loss as to how to handicap it Clearly any sort of autonomous driving system will have to include imaging technologies sensors and controls as well as a processing platform and software to manage it all Nvidias core technology would seem to fit the processing needs but theres a long way to go before selfdriving cars are really ready for primetime The semiconductor market isnt what it used to be and I dont believe companies can get very far pursuing a strategy of ignoring margins and expecting hoping that growth will make everything okay in the end With that those companies that focus on really leveraging unique defensible assets should do well over the long term I think Nvidias GPUbased technology fits and the company has the sort of gross margins youd like to see in a defensible asset Now its about leveraging the business generating good marginscash flows and maintaining that sweet spot between investing enough in RD to maintain leadership and create new business opportunities while not wasting resources prospecting for growth Im only looking for midsingledigit longterm revenue growth and Nvidia could exceed that if it outperforms in markets like data centers and autos Im expecting further improvement in adjusted free cash flow margins into the high teens but the discounted cash flows dont get me to an attractive fair value today On the other hand the companys GAAP operating margins even after subtracting the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>licensing payments would support a price higher into the s Nvidia outperformed my expectations in and could certainly do so again If management is correct about the size of the companys addressable markets and its ability to compete effectively for share and keeps its eyes on the ball with respect to margins and leveraging the companys true strengths I can see a path to upward revisions in growth and margin expectations down the line While Im still cautious on the shares I like the company and will continue to follow it Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it
