Alpha Mar AM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation INTC Includes AAPL GOOG GOOGL LVMUY MSFT SSNLF by Alcaraz Research Apple hired a sales director from Swiss firm TAG Heuer last year to help it lunch the Apple Watch TAG Heuer is now out for revenge the luxury watchmaker has partnered with Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to launch its highend Android Wear smartwatch Intels x Curie or Quark SoC sales could benefit from the legendary brand power of TAG Heuer and LVMH network Luxury Swiss watch company TAG Heuer has recruited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Google NASDAQ GOOGL to help it compete with Apples NASDAQ AAPL upcoming smartwatch The folks at TAG Heuer apparently did not like Apple hiring away its sales director last year Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have been allegedly getting closer recently with rumors that the next iPhone models for would contain an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE modem However TAG Heuer is a subsidiary of the worlds foremost purveyor of luxury goods LVMHMoet Hennessy Louis Vuitton OTCPK LVMUY Krzanich is smart enough to see the huge potential of getting on the good side of LVMH Apple for all its expertise in selling highpriced iPhones is a newbie compared to LVMHs long reign as the worlds king of luxury brands I am also long on Apple but looking at the chart below compels me to believe that LVMH is not the underdog when it comes to luxury smartwatches Those who look down on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a tryinghard supplier of x Atom chips to Chinese phone vendors should be impressed by this TAG Heuer deal LVMH sold its stake in Hermes but still managed to post a increase in revenue to billion euros billion in todays rates On paper LVMH is a far more experienced vendor of luxury watches Intels expertise will now help TAG Heuer come up with a smartwatch that could compete with the Apple Watch Edition Unlike Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT which opted to use an ARM v chip inside its Smart Band fitness tracker the overlords at LVMH hired <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to help it create the first TAG Heuer luxury Android Wear watch LVMH will unveil the TAG Heuer smartwatch this coming Thursday The Reuters article said the Intelpowered TAG Heuer smartwatch will have the same features as the Apple Watch It will be a digital version of the TAG Heuer Carrera sports watch lineup While some people are already impressed with the audacity of Apple to sell a smartwatch some people are actually selling secondhand ordinary not smart TAG Heuer watches for or higher The TAG Heuer deal will definitely boost Intels Internet of Things strategy Unlike smartphones and tablets luxury smartwatches will not require contra revenue The very high operating margin on a TAG Heuer Android smart watch means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could easily charge tounit for a soupedup version of its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Curie wearable computing chip Googles Android Wear OS business is now Intelfriendly I am not really sure if TAG Heuer will use an x Quark processor that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Curie has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought the firm behind the Basis fitness watch product last year TAG Heuer might integrate the technology of the Basis Peak smartwatch inside Carrera products Android Wear OS ensures that the TAG Heuer smart watch will be compatible with the many different version of Android OS inside peoples phones The Basis Peak watch used a proprietary OS and had trouble integrating with some Android phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is getting inside a luxury smartwatch made by a company with a proven track record of selling very expensive wristwatches TAG Heuer is just one of the many expensive brands that LVMH owns Unlike Samsung OTC SSNLF and Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now set to benefit from the moneybags privilege of luxury goods Samsung is the no player in smartwatches in but I do not think it will release a luxury Gear Android Wear watch Volumewise TAG Heuers smartwatch is unlikely to match the numbers of Samsungs Gear products However the mighty brand power of TAG Heuer and LVMHs global network of distributors makes me believe that a Intelpowered luxury watch will be more profitable than any current Android Wear products The combined might of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Google and LVMH could make it difficult for Apples luxury watches to achieve the same level of success that iPhones have now Apples entrylevel smartwatches will face pressure from Samsung and other OEMs who sells sub watches and LVMH will pressure the luxury Apple Watch Edition The smart money now is on INTC and LVMH because some of the million smartwatches in will definitely feature <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>technology and products CCS Insight predicts that million wearable devices will be in used by of them watches Other OEMs like Microsoft may also get inspired by the TAG Heuer deal and hire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to create luxury smartwatches or fitness bands for them The implication of this TAG Heuer deal is also more than just about watches LVMH sells billions of dollars worth of male and female clothing and accessories The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Curie is perfect addition to any Louis Vuitton bag Not for human fitness tracking but as an antitheft measure Expensive designer bags and clothing are favorite targets of thieves The bit MHz Pentiumclass <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Quark SE processor inside the tiny Curie is powerful enough to handle Bluetooth GPS TrueKey and voicerecognition software for identification The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Curie hardware and Basis Science technology are also perfect combo for high couture clothing Eyewear brand Oakley has already signed up to test Curie Luxottica who owns the Oakley and Rayban brands struck a deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to develop smart eyewear products last year The highfashion status of LVMH might be powerful enough to sell xmoreexpensive fitness bands than the Intelpowered Mica smart bracelet Investors who want to ride the coming boom in smart devices ought to consider adding INTC to their portfolio The elitist people who buy Swiss watches are likely to prefer an LVMH TAG Heuer Hugot Bulgari brand over the ordinarysounding Apple Watch Edition Eleven other highlypaid professional analysts at TipRanks agree with my bullish outlook for <span
