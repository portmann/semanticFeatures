Alpha At Intels Investor Meeting the company indicated that it was shifting investment out of phones tablets and into growth areas such as Data Center <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>hasnt given up on mobile devices but its strategy has changed At Intels NASDAQ INTC Investor Meeting on November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management indicated that it was shifting investment out of moneylosing areas such as smartphones and into three key areas of growth data center Internet of Things and nonvolatile memory This is an intelligent move on Intels part but the retreat on mobile devices should concern <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors What exactly is Intels mobile device strategy going forward It was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Chairman Andy Bryant who first dropped the bomb at the meeting He stated in his matter of fact and direct way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was reducing investment in moneylosing businesses like smartphones in order to focus investments in the key areas of growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>As I have considered Intels mobile device strategy to be a failure I was gratified by Chairman Bryants candor My gratification was short lived Very quickly it became apparent that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management was conflicted about how to present the shift in strategy Since the beginning of the year when the Mobile Computing Group and the PC Client Groups were combined there has been a tendency to dissemble about the losses associated with the mobile business This reached new heights in certain euphemisms that were employed in this years presentations As of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>set a goal of an operating margin improvement of million for the mobile business in as highlighted on page of CFO Stacy Smiths presentation Coming off with a billion operating loss for MCG no one doubted that the million was a reduction of losses As of this year that million goal has been transmogrified into the million Mobile Profitability Goal which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>claims it is on track to exceed according to page of CFO Smiths presentation In addition Smiths chart promised another million in profitability improvement for The unsuspecting investor might construe that Intels mobile business is on the way to achieving an million profit for the year Analysts were quick to pounce on this point During the first QA an analyst asked why mobile losses werent going down by more than million in This would have been the right time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management to correct the supposition of the analyst but management did not Instead CEO Krzanich acknowledged that yes contra revenue was going away but there was still spending on modems a big push for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>He also acknowledged that phone processor and modem shipments would not have sufficient volume to provide profitability And thats the way it went in the QA sessions When confronted with the fact of the continuing lack of profitability of the mobile business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management didnt flinch or recoil but there were still these euphemisms of mobile profitability floating around in the presentations The stark reality of the shift in strategy in mobile was captured in another chart by Stacy Smith showing qualitatively the shifts in investment Intels product plans for also reflected the deemphasis on mobile products SoFIA production will move to nm and SoFIA will receive an LTE modem but the product is almost DOA as it stands Almost no phone manufacturers have adopted the Atom X SoFIA and there isnt a single X equipped phone available in the US At the Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>execs talked up the Asus Zen Phone but this doesnt use the X but instead an older Atom series processor Even the latest Atom X tablet processor manufactured on Intels best nm process is no match for the performance of the best smartphones such as the Samsung OTCSSNLF Galaxy S or the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone s In the chart below I compare benchmarks for a variety of devices including two tablets that use the X as well as the ZenFone the Galaxy S and the iPhone s In all but one category DMark Physics the iPhone s is the best usually followed by the Galaxy S in second place Ive included the Acer Predator tablet even though benchmark data for the tablet is incomplete because its an Atom X tablet that runs an Android bit rather than the Microsoft Surface which runs a Windows bit I did this to illustrate that Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Windows does not penalize the performance of the processor as some commenters have alleged SoFIA appears to be a complete dead end since it wont offer competitive performance in and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt seem to have anything planned beyond it Many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>advocates have assumed that all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to do in order to build a smartphone processor was to dumb down its desktop processor sufficiently to squeeze into the smartphone form factor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has done that but I think its significant that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has not been able to build a truly best in class smartphone processor at any price The lack of a classleading processor conveys that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may still be unable to achieve the power efficiency of ARM processors Ive inferred from the lack of cost competitiveness in tablets and smartphones that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture is fundamentally disadvantaged in cost relative to the simpler ARM architecture Another series of charts presented by Bill Holt General Manger Technology and Manufacturing Group may inadvertently demonstrate the ARM advantage Holt as he has in previous years put up a series of charts claiming in effect that competing nm processes from Samsung and TSMC are not as good as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because they dont truly scale as small as Intels nm process These charts are based on theoretical scaling relationships Then Holt showed a chart based on actual measure transistor density from real devices Lo and behold the transistor densities for the ARM chips all based on Apple SOCs were actually quite a bit higher than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Broadwell or Skylake Holt explains this by observing that the Apple A and A have more inherently dense elements He argues that if the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture is normalized to the same composition as the A and A it achieves higher transistor density The trouble with this argument is that theres really no way to normalize the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture devices to have the same composition as the Apple A and A To a large extent the composition is a function of the architectural differences between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and ARM as well as specific implementation choices each company makes in its chip designs Key elements of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>devices such as the so called tall cells and Reg Files are not even used in Apples ARM based SOCs Holts charts highlight the fact that ARM architecture devices can overcome a process disadvantage and achieve higher transistor density and therefore be lower cost devices In semiconductor manufacturing cost scales with surface area of the chip This points to an inherent cost advantage for ARM devices Much of the dissembling and mixed messages of the Investor Meeting presentations appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain the appearance that everything is going fine and is on track But clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has hit a major roadblock in its assault on mobile devices This is nowhere more apparent than in tablet processors At the investor meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reiterated the success of its tablet processor strategy and boasted that million processors had been sold through Q However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is projecting only million tablet processors will be sold in Q a drop in units yy As I noted in my Q earnings article as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>withdraws contra revenue it doesnt have much to show for it in terms of ongoing sales Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>force fed the mobile device industry million tablet processors yet somehow this wasnt enough volume for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to break even and it lost billion in MCG This past year even through Q Ive shown that Intels mobile losses have continued and I believe this is generally accepted by the analyst community Although its circumstantial the evidence just keeps mounting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>simply cant be cost competitive with the ARM world even when it offers products that are inferior to the class leaders such as Apple and Samsung And with the Holt data on transistor density we have the first concrete physical explanation of why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is more expensive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors are inherently bulkier and therefore more expensive Despite the effort to keep up appearances we saw at the Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>pivoting away from mobile and wanting to focus its efforts and investor attention on what it considers its key growth areas Investors may choose to consider Intels mobile retreat as temporary but if the company isnt competitive in mobile and is reducing the investment required to be competitive that implies that the retreat will be permanent The mobile device market is a huge market to be locked out of especially when Intels expectations are for basically zero growth in the PC market This could represent a failure of monumental proportions Will the growth areas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has targeted compensate for missing out on mobile In part of
