that support the more financial focus of Novembers Investor Day IDF usually includes technology announcements with other tech announcements made before IDF such as last years D XPoint announcement The focus seems to be on the shift to a more connected world this shift seems to be multifaceted Facets of this potential diamond in the rough include shift in management shift in approach shift in staffing as well as a shift in technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has an annual reporting regimen that includes quarterly reports Jan April July Oct <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Developer Forum August and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Day in November These are the major events to watch Other asneeded events can add more color The August and November events tend to coincide with technological and financial announcements respectively that can excite investors The excitement associated with the announcements can coincide with seasonal increases in sales leading up to the backtoschool and holiday shopping seasons These seasonal events often result in rising stock values in the fall followed by disappointment and falling stock prices in the spring Logic and history indicate that significant technological announcements involving multiple large corporations are made prior to IDF so that IDF can expand on these announcements specific to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In the June D XPoint announcement with Micron NASDAQ MU allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to talk in more detail at IDF about D XPoint For the major announcement appears to be the joint BMW OTCPKBAMXY <span style='background-color:

at IDF in August From my perspective this autonomous car announcement by itself is not a huge event It certainly does not quickly build <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales revenue The direction toward high compute demand technology does support Intels longrange efforts to reinvent itself as the tech company that allows for a version of Moores Law to make new technological advancements possible and mainstream Autonomous cars certainly is a much larger market than autonomous drones Intels focus last year Still autonomous vehicles are a longrange benefit to Intels earnings while being a shortterm drag with the upfront investment needed in RD This years IDF is shaping up different than the last two IDFs I attended The previous IDFs had lots of Keynote addresses with most of the divisions having their own Keynote or major session So far this years IDF has only two Keynotes Brian Krzanich CEO and a joint Keynote with Murthy Renduchintala President Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group and Diane M Bryant Executive Vice President General Manager Data Center Group This focus seems to reinforce Intels multifaceted shift to a truly connected world Intels management is being reorganized with many longterm management employees having left over the last year Having just three high level managers presenting the keynotes allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to better control the main message The remainder of the sessions can then focus on how developers can grow with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as it focuses on the connected world The main message appears to be a shift That shift is multifaceted and appears to be intent on taking a rough diamond that does not look impressive and cutting it in such a way to create an exquisite diamond that sparkles from all directions The rough diamond appears to be the connected world This connected world now seems pretty unclear with lots of promise for new ways of improving health new ways to make transportation safer and more efficient new ways to view sports new ways to connect buyers with items for sale etc Each of these is unclear and needs refinement to sparkle and shine The shift also includes changes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management and staff reductions to refocus on the truly connected world These management staff and staff reductions have been discussed in great deal in other articles My opinion The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>board is looking to make strategic cuts to reveal a beautiful diamond Diane is a keeper with her handling of the Data Center My thoughts on Murthy are not clear yet since I have not even heard him make a presentation Brian is a strong potential for a cut unless clear success comes soon See <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Three Negatives Replacement Cycle Insights

style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>RealSense technology Platforms that aid in delivery of a rich visual experience No mention of nm or nm tech not even Kaby Lake No mention of Telcom and Network Function Virtualization The absence of these areas from the agenda is a major shift for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IDF These areas have been a major focus during past IDFs The absence of mobile phone devices indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is really moving away from the individual phone devices to the larger effort associated with connecting all of the multitude of devices that includes mobile phones IoT PCs etc The absence of nm nm and Kaby Lake indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants developers to focus on what the developers can do with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>tech and not on the details of that new tech Im not sold on this strategy but maybe the how is now less exciting than what can be done using the tech Maybe the tech has gotten ahead of what is being done we can now do more with the tech that we have already so why focus so much on the next level of tech The absence of the last bullet will have me scratching my head for a while Maybe it is as simple as the people that attend IDF are not the Telcom folks Worst case is that the rising star of Telcom is not shaping up as hoped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making a shift in focus The movement to new tech related to worldwide connectivity is huge Management is shifting Employees are shifting Technology is shifting to connectivityrelated benefits Out with the old and in with the new As I have written in previous articles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to work on the long range and the longrange investments will drag on nearterm earnings Watch for a drop in stock price following <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>July earnings disappointment So far IDF is not shaping up to be a driver for increased stock value but I will continue to watch for signs that the shift is turning the corner and delivering results It would be really good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to provide some clear product delivery road maps that developers can rely on for implementation and sales These would include FPGAs new modems Kaby Lake D XPoint products I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha
