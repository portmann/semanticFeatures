NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha After the recent preannouncement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares might be worth another look Overly optimistic PC expectations appear to have been reset DCG growth one of the keys to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>story appears wellsupported Remember stocks never trade at fair value They trade at what people are willing to pay for them a friend of mine And so it goes with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>INTC my onagain offagain object of fascination I decided to sell out of my position in the midtohigh s despite knowing I might be leaving upside on the table because I was no longer comfortable with the riskreward at that valuation meeting my personal requirements On the back of what boils down to merely one data point the stock has since sold off nearly making the name one investors might consider taking a second look at While I was for a long time more constructive on PCs than most investors that equation flipped around late last year and early this year I thought the idea that lowpowered tablets would kill the PC was patently absurd and indeed iPad sales ended up hitting a wall At the same time though PCs dont really strike me as a major growth market so I was a bit skeptical of projections for PCs to return to longterm growth even if singledigit The increasing prevalence of hostedSaaS software including packages like Office and CS that were traditionally local means that the segment of users requiring lots of local processing capacity will likely continue to narrow and more portableless powerful ins will continue to gain popularity There will be troughs and valleys but I think my longterm forecast is probably flattodown slightly To me the <span

growth in DCG is wellsupported and despite the preannounce management seemed to suggest that DCG expectations are unchanged Over the past few months several meetings have confirmed my beliefs here The soon to be former management of Mavenir NYSE MVNR seemed convinced that the ramp of VoLTE and NFV will lead to a significant replacement of ASICs and other custom silicon within the telecom stack with

anything more than vaporware at this point The biggest question remaining is mobile losses Ive been growing somewhat less bullish on Intels mobile prospects than I once was primarily due to fatigue to some degree it keeps being a nextyear story but they did just win a modem slot from Qualcomm in the iPhone and they also nailed their audacious tabletchip goal While mobile losses should narrow theres significant execution risk here and at least for me its become a showme story I havent really gone back to update my model but I still think fair value for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is somewhere in the mids making the current price decently attractive for certain types of investors especially in light of the strong dividend Intels management team seems to be doing all the right things and the companys IP moat is significant I dont directly own INTC as I have much higherreturn uses for capital elsewhere but I did write some strike monthly puts on INTC in a yieldfocused family account hence the disclosure If prices continue falling into the high or mid s I would likely consider writing more puts or even purchasing shares outright in my own account Source
