class='textDiv'>Qualcomms Quixotic Quest Qualcomm Inc NASDAQQCOM Seeking Alpha Last week Qualcomm announced an ARMbased server processor ARM processors have much to offer in terms of energy efficiency and potentially lower cost in high volume production Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has launched a preproduction Server Development Platform which features a core ARM processor for data center applications QCOM becomes just the latest company to try to field an ARM processor to challenge the dominance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC in the Data Center This challenge is probably doomed to failure Readers who are familiar with my past articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Has Become The BlackBerry of Semiconductors will know that Im not a big fan of INTCs current management Furthermore from a pure technology standpoint I think ARMbased servers are a good idea But even with these biases theres no denying Intels dominance of the data center In Intels Q earnings report the Data Center Group is the real bright spot posting yy revenue growth of to billion and operating profit growth of yy to billion I wish that an ARM processor vendor could challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the data center but I just cant bring myself to believe that its possible This really has nothing to do with the technical merits of ARM processors vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture x processors A recent article on SA by Alpha Max provides an excellent rundown of the technical issues regarding data center adoption of ARM processors SA contributor Alcaraz Research has applauded the move by Qualcomm to challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Neither article really addresses the fundamental question of why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has become so dominant in servers and why current attempts have proved more or less futile There are already commercially available and very technically credible ARM server processors available from Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC the XGene processor family and from Cavium NASDAQ CAVM the Thunder X family AMD NASDAQ AMD has the Opteron A Seattle chip available to developers The world doesnt want for ARM server chips But the world does seem to want for a market for ARM server chips Applied Micro and Cavium are financial basket cases that both posted losses in the June quarter And AMD Im not sure that even a hugely successful Seattle would be able to save AMD I doubt that the financial difficulties these companies are facing are due merely to the length of time it takes to get their chips certified for data center use although thats undoubtedly a factor The difficulty getting these chips adopted really speaks to the fundamental business advantage that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>currently enjoys in the data center Scale Engineering Scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to leverage its engineering of its main stream PC chips in order to reduce the engineering cost of server chips Intels current Xeon E and E Xeon servers which are really INTCs data center work horses use Haswell CPU cores originally targeted to the mainstream PC market The difference is that Xeon chips contain a lot more Haswell cores as well as other features to increase reliability and support virtualization Cavium and Applied Micro dont have the benefit of a large consumer market for their chips in order to dilute the engineering cost of developing their chips Qualcomm is different in this respect so it potentially mitigates this advantage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Scale Production Scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has huge production scale and capability as well as experience producing the Haswell architecture nm FinFET node Haswell by virtue of being a mature production node provides the lowest cost production approach for INTC for its server chips and probably the lowest cost production in the industry Once again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can leverage its production of mainstream PC chips to reduce costs of its server chips This is an advantage that no other manufacturer has been able to touch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>plans to move Xeon to Broadwell in once again maintaining both its process nm FinFET and production cost advantages Scale Market Scale INTCs dominance of the server market as highlighted in this recent IDC market survey represents tremendous inertia in Intels favor The operating systems software stacks knowledge base and IT experience are already there for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Its managers know that they can upgrade hardware or expand their server capacity in full confidence that their current platforms will continue to work Adopting a new processor architecture means learning curve software recertification and integration snafus galore Small companies and startups especially will be reluctant to undertake this battle when the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>alternative is easier and less costly And this really brings me to why ARM processors arent more competitive In mobile devices Ive argued that ARM processors have a cost advantage compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>INTC doesnt have any scale advantage in mobile and the ARM architecture is simpler and lower cost to manufacture on a per chip basis In servers the ARM cost advantage gets swamped by total cost of ownership TCO considerations The manufacturing cost advantage doesnt even exist for Applied Micro or Cavium since they havent got the scale It might exist for Qualcomm but once again TCO is going to favor the status quo Alcaraz has argued that Qualcomm is rich enough to challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but INTC has the deeper pockets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also has a thriving and profitable business that it is in its best interests to protect In the contra revenue scheme for mobile devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has demonstrated that it is willing to take a nearterm loss if its in its interest to do so What would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>do if its interests were genuinely threatened in the Data Center Its contra revenue with a vengeance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can afford to cut prices significantly without even having to post a loss since it has considerable profit to burn through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can afford to starve any competitor out including Qualcomm When I see tech company managements grasping at straws like this I think short opportunity Im not quite willing to go that far with Qualcomm yet Qualcomm has indicated a willingness to spin off its hardware unit and become an RD licensing outfit I still consider that the best option QCOM has also suggested that it could return as Samsungs OTCSSNLF first choice for the next Galaxy smart phone and this possibility cannot be ruled out Since midsummer there have certainly been plenty of rumors about Samsung choosing the Snapdragon for the Galaxy S I personally doubt Samsung will do this but Ill admit to a certain amount of doubt If Qualcomm gets back on the Galaxy it probably doesnt matter that its server efforts are a waste of time the company will be making plenty of money anyway QCOM has scheduled its Septemberquarter earnings call a little later than normal for November possibly because it expects to get a decision from Samsung by then So I see the earnings call as a potential watershed for Qualcomm and Im holding off making any recommendations until then We only use
