that INTC is firmly committed to the x architecture for PCs Internet of Things and Servers At Computex <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to show off processors far superior to anything AMD is currently shipping Following Intels NASDAQ INTC Q earnings I wrote that the company had a fundamental choice between retrenchment and transformation After recent presentations at Bernstein and Computex it has become clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has chosen retrenchment doubling down on x architecture to preserve its domination of the PC market and leveraging this to make gains in the data center and Internet of Things The wisdom of this course of action will long be debated but one thing is clear AMDs NASDAQ AMD x processors offer no hope for the company Following CEO Brian Krzanichs presentation at the Sanford C Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference SA contributor Bruce Burnworth wrote a very thoughtful piece in reaction Burnworth a long time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>supporter acknowledged getting out of the stock in the article and talked frankly about the need to replace Krzanich Burnworth realizes that Intels fundamental problem is its failure in mobile which he summarized this way He ignored and did not mention the impact that smartphones have had on PC sales Sure we need PCs to perform work but there are many people that used to by a PC for nonwork purposes that now rely on their smartphone for internet access email and other nonwork items To me ignoring this impact on PC sales is like sticking your head in the sand Krzanichs ability to ignore or rationalize unpleasant facts is only one of the many issues Ive had with his regime Beginning in with Intels contra revenue subsidies of its tablet processors Krzanich claimed repeatedly that this was to defray chipset costs He made this claim despite the fact that the mobile systems on chips SOCs from the true industry leaders such as Samsung OTCSSNLF Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM had already dispensed with the need for a chipset in the form of processor combined with an auxiliary IO controller or South Bridge Intels subsequent withdrawal of contra revenue this year and the collapse of tablet processor sales combined with the failure to get any market traction with its smartphone SoFIA Atom X processors led to the decision to pull the plug on mobile As painful as the decision must have been this was a commendable facing of reality for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Although it came as a shock to Intels supporters I saw reason for some optimism INTC installing a Qualcomm alumnus Murthy Renduchintala to oversee Client Computing and IoT as well as review <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products suggested that a major change in direction could be ahead With benefit of hindsight it appears that Murthys main impact has been pulling the plug on mobile processors even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>focuses renewed efforts on its modems and on G It could be argued that the decision to discontinue the Atom X series mobile processors is merely a retreat But in the mean time the lack of mobile presence represents a huge hole in Intels strategy Based on the Bernstein presentation as well as Intels presentations at this years Computex in Taipei its almost certain that INTC will not embark on a major change of processor architecture such as jumping to ARM architecture Well there was only a very remote chance of that happening even with Murthys influence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has simply chosen the wellworn path of so many large tech companies that become incapable of disrupting themselves The logic of this is inescapable if nearterm financial results are the primary driver <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a huge investment in x in the design expertise of its engineering staff its intellectual property and the installed base of customers and users Given a nearmonopoly position in x and the fact of a still very profitable business not many American corporations could turn aside from this Not many would chase an uncertain future in ARM architecture no matter how bright that future might appear Computex presented the world with Intels new vision for the PC We were greeted with the spectacle of Navin Shenoy Intels new head of Client Computing declaring the companys unwavering commitment to the PC This might be open to interpretation but I basically translate that as Intels unwavering commitment to the x PC There is a logic to that commitment which has been reasonably articulated by various <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>executives such as Krzanich Shenoy and Diane Bryant head of Data Center Group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can leverage its existing and continuing investment in x to foster growth in the key areas of the data center and IoT Whether that growth is really there is another subject for debate but clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt have the stomach for the alternative If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were to announce that it would suddenly start designing ARM processors for ins and servers this would send a tremendously disruptive message to its existing customers The loss in x business would in no way be adequately compensated by new ARM processor business The contrast between the presentations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD at Computex couldnt have been more stark The only new processor that AMD could show at Computex thats actually shipping in the near term was the Carrizo derived Bristol Ridge Its totally noncompetitive with Intels current Skylake and will drop further behind when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>rolls out its Apollo Lake processors later this year The current gap in processor technology is very visible in the products While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could show off ultralight ins that are mm thin and dont require a fan AMD could only show clunky oldstyle notebooks for Bristol Ridge The in segment led by the Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro and various knockoffs is growing at doubledigit rates according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AMD has nothing to offer in this class And Zen isnt going to save the day for AMD It will first be offered to the part of the PC market in steady decline the desktop Following that AMD indicated that it will hurl Zen at the server market in a classic Hail Mary Given how determined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is to hold onto the x franchise and build on it for growth in the cloud I dont see INTC giving AMD a shot with Zen We still dont know how well Zen will perform but it almost doesnt matter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has shown that it will compete on price if that is required to meet its business objectives Whether on price performance or both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will shut AMD out of the server market because it must <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont have to compete with AMD long on price because in INTC rolls out its nm process and the performance bar gets reset all over again Intels strategy on x is a last man standing strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt need to worry about keeping AMD around to avoid regulatory scrutiny <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can point to the growth of competition from ARM processors in mobile devices IoT and even the data center as proof that it has enough competition on its hands without AMD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>knows AMD has to be put down for good With any luck <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can pick up Radeon for pocket change giving it an ability to build competitive graphics into its SOCs If AMD somehow survives it wont be by making money on x processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been able to grow or at least maintain PC revenue and profit at AMDs expense despite the overall decline in the PC market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to keep doing what works Its a strategy that has downside in the long term years since it doesnt address the threat posed by ARM processors to its core business In the near term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can grow incrementally by driving AMD out of the x business This is probably the only growth path available to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>so I dont see the company foregoing it With nearterm growth available <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains a hold in my view AMD remains a short since the market clearly doesnt see whats in store for AMD Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
