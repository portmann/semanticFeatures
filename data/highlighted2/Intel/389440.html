class='textDiv'>Google Or Microsoft Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOG Seeking Alpha Alphabet and Microsoft both reported lackluster earnings How the mighty have fallen Coming into their earnings call Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT were expected to light up the tech sector after IBM NYSE IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC disappointed But the two have clearly failed to live up to the high expectations and both stocks have been pummeled quite a bit I have followed both companies for years and until recently considered them almost equally good fodder for longterm investors I still think Alphabet is a good bet for investors with a threeyear investment time frame but Im not so sure about Microsoft anymore Lets have a look at what went wrong at both companies that leads me to believe Alphabet is a better longterm bet at this point than Microsoft I have emphasized at this point because my thoughts are subject to change and I will continue reexamining my investment thesis one quarter after another For starters both stocks have performed quite well over the past months though Alphabet stock has outperformed Microsoft stock by quite a wide margin with gains of vs I wont delve much into the details of each companys earnings report but will only take a look at whats dogging both companies In Googles case that happens to be Expanding losses by its speculative moonshot businesses and Ballooning TAC for Googles distribution partners Concerns about rising costs for Googles moonshot projects have dogged the stock for years until quite recently when investors started rewarding Google after the companys declining overall costs tempered those concerns But those old ghosts have returned to haunt Google During the last quarter Googles Other Bets operating expenses jumped from M a year ago to M good for YY growth and almost double Googles top line growth of Other Bets now account for of Googles operating expenses and gobble up close to of the companys revenue despite bringing in just to the top line To compound matters only Google Nest Fiber and Verily have any revenues to speak off In any case the M the businesses brought in last quarter is actually much less than what many analysts speculated before Google took the wraps off these speculative projects Prior to that some analysts were heard crowing that a business like Fiber could pull in about B in revenues as early as Good luck if Fiber manages to bring in that much two or even three years from now Google has in the past been unwavering about its commitment to its moonshot projects and has been adamant that it will keep investing in them cost concerns by investors be damned But the latest report shows that the companys hardline stance on the matter is beginning to soften Who knows maybe Google has finally learned that playing hardball with investors is a mugs game Google is reportedly putting up Boston Dynamics for sale its robotics business that it acquired in after realizing the business was unlikely to bring in any significant revenues any time in the near future Part of Googles decision was informed by concerns about the robots humanoid traits and fears that the company was creating robots to take over human tasks But much of the reason for the sale is financial Former Google senior vice president and CEO Larry Page adviser Jonathan Rosenberg reportedly had this to say during one company meeting We as a startup of our size cannot spend plus percent of our resources on things that take ten years and that theres some time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and that needs to be a few years Google CFO Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that Google will rationalize its investments where it had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology If Google was to seriously start evaluating its moonshot projects on account of financial viability then most is not all moonshot projects including Nest and Verily would be given the boot Nest is Googles most successful moonshot project in terms of revenues generated When Google bought Nest in it committed to supporting the business with a M annual budget for three years and in return Nest promised that its key executives would remain onboard for that period Nest brought in M in or of total revenue by Other Bets The actual revenue by Nest is in all likelihood lower than that when you back out revenue by Dropcam which was acquired shortly after the Nest merger So Nest is likely still deeply in the red The saving grace for Nest is that it has solid revenues to show and could be quite close to turning a profit Meanwhile Verily never seems to be free of controversy for long and is currently being rocked by a mass exodus by its top executives Needless to say the division has little to show in terms of revenue not to speak of profits Google has more than a dozen moonshot projects in total I dont see the company abandoning its pet projects such as selfdriving cars or Google Fiber for that matter whether or not they become profitable in the near future But some like Verily Calico and Project Wing could easily end up being axed if push came to shove Now there is a glimmer of hope since Google is beginning to show a willingness to sell at least some of its cashdraining projects and these are legion Needless to say the resulting cost savings would be very significant without an accompanying hit on the top line Now lets turn to Googles ballooning traffic acquisition costs In all honesty investor concerns about Googles swelling TAC really is much ado about nothing Although total TAC increased YY slower than top line growth TAC as a percentage of Google ad revenue fell from to Google is increasingly relying on its own sites than distribution sites to drive its top line Google sites now contribute to the top line up from a year ago Network sites account for of overall TAC compared to just by Google sites In any case paid clicks grew YY much faster than TAC growth As long as these trends hold which they likely will then growth in network TAC is unlikely to become a big problem for the company Google said that growth in TAC is being driven by an increasing shift to mobile and programmatic advertising These are secular trends so not much is expected to change here Im not sure how programmatic advertising is increasing Googles TAC unless maybe the company is relying heavily on thirdparty platforms to serve up these automated ads What I do know is that the shift to programmatic advertising from traditional display ads is taking a hit on all publishers due to the lower ad rates Marketers though love them due to their better ROI and of course the lower costs Big publishers like Google and Facebook NASDAQ FB though are generally holding up much better than smaller ones like Twitter NYSE TWTR and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD The ongoing weakness in the PC market is old news by now Analysts have been calling a bottom in the PC market in maybe late or in After a multiyear slump Gartner sees the PC market returning to positive growth territory again in The PC market has been in a freefall for six straight years and its beginning to appear like the muchhyped turnaround might not be coming after all The last quarter was pretty brutal so we can only hope that Gartner is right this time around Microsofts transition from a company that sells onpremise perpetual software licenses to a cloud subscription company is working but progress is slow maybe even painfully slow depending on how you cut it Microsofts cloud runrate hit B from B the previous quarter QQ growth despite a blistering growth by Azure Many investors think that this is something of an anomaly because cloud growth last quarter clocked in at QQ In dollar terms Microsofts cloud grew M during the last quarter There have been quarters in the past when QQ cloud growth has been only M So last quarter was not exceptionally bad Microsoft is a large and complex company with many moving parts Adobe Systems NASDAQ ADBE is perhaps the first traditional software company to complete the move to the cloud The company managed to pull off the feat in about four years flat primarily because its product portfolio is much lighter than Microsofts Adobe now enjoys cloudlike valuations with a PE ratio about three times what it was before the transition Microsoft will be lucky to complete a cloud move in anything less than a decade from now Current cloud runrate works out to just of Microsofts revenue so there is still a long way to go Finally I would like to take a look at Microsofts hardware division the companys largest revenue segment of revenue Save for Surface Microsofts hardware division is a big thorn in the companys flesh Microsoft sold just M Lumia handsets during the last quarter down QQ and YY Sales decline the previous quarter was from M units to M So this is a death spiral Sales of nonLumia handsets from the Nokia business were M down YY so no respite here either Windows phone revenue has shrunk to M so maybe its now downsized to a point where it cannot affect Microsofts growth too much and thats a good thing But declining console sales certainly can because this is a multibilliondollar business Microsoft managed to sell M Xbox One consoles the first year after its launch Recent estimates by Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA put lifetime sale of the console at M units This implies that it has taken about month to move the next M or M units a year unit sales decline In dollar terms the decline exceeds because Microsoft has been cutting prices Maybe the console era is over But then again maybe not Twice as many Xbox One and PS consoles have been sold than their previous generation counterparts so maybe its too early to conclusively say that era is gone Microsoft and Sony NYSE SNE are rumored to be contemplating upgrades to their respective consoles something people are calling half consoles and dubbed Xbox and PS Gamers are used to receiving big leaps every years so they are quite likely to revolt towards this move Meanwhile the Surface business is doing great especially after the introduction of Surface Pro and Surface Book But this is a billion business which is currently too small to move the needle for the company Well Surface is neither a tablet nor a laptop so investors can only hope that it will take a life of its own and its growth trajectory will defy that by its cousins In any case skinny laptops have been doing well in general But at a price point more than double that of an iPad its doubtful whether this device can really take off Apples Air and Pro are currently outselling Surface at an almost ratio In fact Microsoft might not be as interested in selling large volumes of Surface devices as much as it is interested in inspiring thirdparty manufacturers to make more attractive devices and in the process make Windows products more appealing to the consumer So where is Microsofts respite going to come from The only one I can think of at this point is if the PC market turns around as per projections by some analysts But I dont think this is something that investors can really count on What if the market bottoms out and then grows very anemically or worse still stays flat going forward In Googles case its all about cutting costs something that is quite achievable and one the company has already started doing Free cash flow jumped last quarter to B after a decrease in capex to B So the company has already demonstrated that its capable of trimming some fat under Ruth Porat And interestingly Googles top line is now almost as big as Microsofts yet its growth has been accelerating revenue growth was a year ago while Microsofts has been declining At this point I am willing to bet that Alphabets stock is a better bet over the next three years than Microsofts stock
