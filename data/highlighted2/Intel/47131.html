NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels products now rely on an advanced lithographic technique called multiple patterning Multiple patterning relies on increased exposures or other processing steps to pattern features smaller than the optical limit Use of multiple patterning at the nm node will likely lead to increasing levels of design restriction for the various semiconductor design houses Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as an IDM has already incorporated these changes and leads on process metrics it is well positioned for these trends Multiple patterning is an advanced lithographic technique now being used by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and others in leading edge semiconductor manufacturing As is well known semiconductor manufacturers pursue roughly x shrinks in transistor size every two years to reduce wafer printing costs as well as achieve product performance improvements It is extremely important to understand these manufacturing processes which can cost roughly billion in capital expenses each year It is multiple patterning which is the crucial enabler of the current latest generation semiconductor nodes Intels nm process makes use of selfaligned double patterning SADP and their nm process also likely made limited use of it TSMCs NYSE TSM latest upcoming generation process called FF FinFet and Samsung OTCSSNLF and GlobalFoundries latest process nm can all be believed to use multiple patterning In order to understand Intels latest generation products Broadwell Core M and the upcoming Broxton we need to understand what multiple patterning means and how it works Similarly all of Intels competitors products such as Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Apple NASDAQ AAPL based on ARM NASDAQ ARMH architecture will have to make use of it at nodes of nm and beyond Furthermore the higher costs of multiple patterning imply that semiconductor designers are likely to start altering their designs in order to compensate for it In Intels case its designers have adjusted to multiple patterning already and its designs are well positioned for future success Each competitor will implement multiple patterning in a different way and it will pose a key added source of process complexity and competitive differentiation This article will provide a basis for understanding multiple patterning In essence multiple patterning refers to a range of procedures for printing lithographic features at smaller sizes than the optical resolution of the printing system That resolution is limited due to the diffraction properties of light as discussed in a lecture by Intels Sam Sivakumar Wikipedia has some good pictures of multiple patterning but I will focus on verbal descriptions here Although multiple patterning provides an eventual cost reduction due to endproduct improvement it increases the cost of wafer processing There are two types of multiple patterning that get discussed most frequently In the first type called double exposure or lithoetchlithoetch a wafer is sent through the lithographic scanner twice with a different mask each time On the first pass the maximum possible resolution is achieved due to the diffraction limit This leaves you with printed features of some minimum width call it w with spaces around them of width L The printed space w can be much finer than the empty space L say L w due to engineering of the photoresist to have a controlled sensitivity to light On the second pass the new pattern to be printed again at minimum feature width w is shifted slightly with respect to the first so that it falls in the unprinted gaps the L space In this way you wind up with two sets of features of length w instead of just one You have effectively cheated the optical resolution limit of the system to print features that are twice as fine as the printer allows by itself Note that without advanced photoresist or other technology to enable tight feature spacing w L this technique would not work The technique also obviously requires excellent overlay precision on the wafer scanner in order to precisely control the offset between different exposure steps The second type of multiple patterning techniques are called selfaligned techniques pitch splitting as termed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or the sidewall image transfer approach as termed by IBM NYSE IBM This is a clever technique that makes use of a very directional etch or an etch which only goes a specific vertical depth In selfaligned double patterning SADP the minimum feature width can be doubled and there are analogous techniques for quadruple and even octuple patterning In pitch splitting techniques only a single pass through the lithography machine is required However the technique is primarily geared toward printing of basic D patterns like lines Since the lithography steps consisting in passes through an ASML NASDAQ ASML Nikon or other scanner are known to be the most expensive part of the wafer fabrication process multiple exposure patterning costs more than selfaligned patterning However both processes require more etching photoresist and other processing steps than would be required for plain single exposure Thus multiple patterning incurs a higher expense Before discussing current applications of multiple patterning lets review available data on the current timelines of production technology for the semiconductor manufacturers As stated in TSMCs latest earnings release TSMC is ramping its nm process in the third quarter of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some lead time on TSMC and has been selling its nm products since fourth quarter They are now available for example in Core M branded products such as in the new Apple Macbook recently reviewed at AnandTech On its last earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stated that it would begin ramping its nm process in the third and fourth quarter of this year TSMC plans to ramp nm in the fourth quarter of and expects revenue contribution in early Its hard to say when these ramps will translate into products available on the broader market but a rough guideline suggests H for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm and H for the rest of the industry nm nanometer production will require extensive use of multiple patterning techniques At a recent IEEE Design Test Round Table discussion panelists concurred that regular lithography is diffraction limited at around nm pitch where pitch refers to the width of a feature This explains why SADP was a necessity for Intels nm process which was reported to have pitches as short as nm In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>released the specifications for its nm node technology compared to nm which I reproduce in the chart above This allows us to estimate pitch lengths at nm The lowest of these estimates is nm for the transistor fin pitch However SADP should only be able to at most half the nm optical resolution of the system and this will be further limited due to overlay precision of the scanner Thus SADP is limited to probably nm maximum resolution This means that selfaligned quadruple patterning SAQP or even more advanced techniques will be necessary at nm The fact that even the nm process had a nm fin pitch suggests that SADP was used in nm as well However the interconnect pitch could have remained on single patterning At nm both the first metal interconnect layer and fin layer are likely to require SAQP whereas the transistor gate layer may only require SADP Note that these estimates are specifically based on Intels numbers and may vary for TSMC Samsung and GlobalFoundries Given that multiple patterning must be employed to shrink to the next node it is necessary to decide which kind of multiple patterning to employ For a complex D shaped circuit multiple exposure patterning is necessary since self aligned patterning is best suited for lines and repetitive structures However the requirement of multiple exposures makes the manufacturing process more expensive Thus the circuit designer can essentially choose to either make a simpler D layout circuit which is cheaper to fabricate or to make a more complicated D layout which is more expensive As Sivakumar talks about in his lecture Intels approach to this multiple patterning cost problem was to go to D layouts Evidently the circuit designers were at the mercy of the process designers On the transition from nm to nm they simplified the logic layout into structures that looked like regularly spaced lines with cuts in them see image here and they have retained this pattern since then The step of forming the lines can be done with pitch splitting or single exposure lithography The step of forming the cuts in the lines still generally requires multiple exposure but this is at least restricted to the simpler pattern of cuts To recap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>simplified its logic circuitry into a D layout on each layer Ultimately the circuits still require D connections at least on the interconnect layers but unless I am otherwise mistaken these D connections can be formed by simply stacking up D connections with appropriately positioned vertical contacts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the advantage that it controls all its own design and manufacturing in the same house It was thus able to make this educated design decision presumably much sooner than the other circuit designers who were less closely informed of controlled by the costs of manufacturing their designs In the case of the foundries such as TSMC there has been no need to impose on customers the demand for D or D layouts in the past since the customer could simply pay more for working in D With the environment of highly increasing process complexity going into SAQP at nm it seems likely that industry logic design will all follow Intels route into the simplest possible options D circuit layout design We can speculate that this might have a significant effect on customers for TSMC and the other foundries such as ARM Apple and Qualcomm This will not be a sudden change as they will have seen it coming over time but it may nevertheless prove significant that they are increasingly forced to switch from D to D layouts What seems most likely is that the increase in manufacturing complexity will tend to have a homogenizing effect on circuit layout and design Circuit designers layouts will all start looking like D SADP layouts Thus differences in architecture for example will become increasingly marginalized compared to differences in process size This is essentially positive news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at least in the short term since its process has a small but documented lead on its competitors I expect multiple patterning is a term we will continue to hear increasingly frequently within the semiconductor world As it stands it has still not been widely discussed outside of technical and academic circles and yet it underlies all future product generations and capabilities It has started popping up more on earnings releases for companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>TSMC and ASML and we should pay attention to what this term means Multiple patterning is currently being applied at all the leading edge nodes and will take another large step forward at the next node nm in SAQP will be a must for nm and the cut mask process will likely involve double or even triple exposure multiple patterning Advances in multiple patterning complexity are likely to drive significant layout simplification over the next few years Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already incorporated these changes it is well positioned for future success In contrast Intels competitors are likely to need to increasingly adopt simplified D logic layouts Due to increased process complexity there will likely be even more differentiation between process nodes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and TSMC but probably less differentiation between process designs Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Understanding Multiple Patterning At Nanometers And
