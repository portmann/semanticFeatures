Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has other alternative markets to help sell its mobile application processors The Windows PC Stick chip business is still the sole domain of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Tier telecom operators like PLDT could purchase bulk orders of PC Stick computers and help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sell more of its Atom chips Investors should not worry about the big drop in tablet application processor sales from Intels NASDAQ INTC Q report There are other mobile products aside from tablets and mobile phones where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can try and sell its Bay Trail Cherry Trail or the sixth generation Skylake mobile processors The Windows PC Stick is an ultrasmall computer that is just slightly larger than a USB thumb drive It can be attached via the HDMI port of a TV or a monitor As of October PLDT NYSE PHI the Philippines biggest telecom operator started bundling a free Intelpowered Windows TVOlution PC Stick to attract new customers for its postpaid DSL internet plans Even existing longterm DSL subscribers like me can get a free TVolution Stick if I sign up for another threeyear lockin period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>previously had an exclusive distribution deal with wireless carrier Starhub for its Compute Stick product in Singapore The cancellation of the generous subsidy on x Atom Bay Trail tablet processors means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will find it even more difficult to compete with entrylevel ARMbased tablet chips from MediaTek and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM The drop in tablet processor sales last quarter is a strong hint that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could still have some unsold inventory of Atom Bay Trail processors Aside from Asustek and Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not really getting any design wins from other major tabletphone manufacturers I therefore opine that a carrierbacked PC stick product could become an alternative volumebased sales avenue for lowpower Atom processors Carrier backing is always great for any new PC product that is just beginning to be introduced in the market The PC Stick concept first unveiled by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>last year now enjoys the support of Acer Asustek OTCASUUY and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY Its a mobile product that could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>get rid of unsold mobile Atom processors that are no longer being bought by subsidyloving Chinese whitebox tablet manufacturers It was indeed a great victory for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to get the backing of major OEMs like Lenovo and Asus for the PC Stick However I still feel that the allout support of a telcocarrier is the more important win A tier telco like PLDT could purchase bulk orders of Bay Trailpowered HDMI PC Stick computers for immediate distribution to its current customers Free bundling of a new product with DSL subscription is a great way to instantly win a customer The plus retail price tag of the PC Stick like the TVolution which uses an oldergeneration Bay Trail Atom F tells me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did not have to subsidize it like it did last year for sub Shenzhenmade whitebox tablets Investors also should appreciate that unlike Android TV HDMI dongles a Windows PC Stick like the Lenovo Stick transforms ordinary HDMIequipped television sets into fullpledged Windows computers The total addressable market therefore for Intels trendsetting Compute Stick PC product is not just limited to home users or DSL subscribers The PC Stick could be used as a cheap portable energyefficient replacement for outdated Windows or Windows XP computers still being used by corporations governments and schools To illustrate a smart IT manager could sign up for a topend Gbps business DSL plan from PLDT and get a bunch of free Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Officecapable TVolution PC Stick computers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already announced that it will release a more powerful Core Mpowered version of its Compute Stick A more powerful sixth generation Skylake processor could transform a HDMI PC Stick into an enterprisecentric computer which could run more CPUdemanding workplacestandard software like Adobes NASDAQ ADBE Photoshop There is already a Cherry Trailequipped business version of the Compute Stick called the MagicStick which touts GB of RAM and gamesfriendly Gen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>GPU technology The MagicStick is an example of how the tiny PC Stick is turning out to be a real desktop PClevel productivity tool <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to sell million subsidized tablet processors last year I guesstimate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also has the potential to sell millionyear of PC Stick application processors The future of Intels mobile chip business is a little brighter when it creates mobile computer designs that Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD is unlikely to get involved with Intels superior miniaturization and lowpower chip design expertise has helped it create a brand new computer product category in the Compute Stick <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains the sole chip supplier of Windows PC Stick products so it has the monopoly advantage The PLDT TVolution deal is a smart template that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could again use in other countries with telecom operators who like giving freebies Dumping free PC Sticks on postpaid customers of telecom operators is a painless method of disseminating these Inteldesigned portable computers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or its OEM partners like Lenovo wont have to shoulder the marketingadvertising budget toward popularizing the PC Stick Carriers desperate to retain or gain new customers will shoulder the advertisingshipping costs of free bundled PC Stick computers To conclude I again reiterate my call that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is
