more than a mobile phone technology G is a new connectivity technology with all devices connecting to all devices seamlessly mobile and stationary devices Intels endtoend approach will win By over billion devices will be connected to the Internet The speed low latency and pervasiveness of G will be essential to effectively connect these billion active devices I dont think we will need to wait until for G technology Out on a limb Moores Law will be applied to communications and bring G in This article goes out on a limb Actually one leg is on one limb another leg on another limb and each arm is hanging on to separate limbs My hope is that if I keep my weight evenly distributed across all four limbs they will be strong enough to support my weight Before I lose you completely Ill jump out of the tree and into the weeds Intels NASDAQ INTC CEO recently made G a huge part of the companys forward looking strategy This is a huge challenge for a company that lost money on G However G is much different from G G was mostly a way for a single mobile phone to communicate to a base station G involves all devices communicating with all devices around it including stationary and mobile devices G is a communication network tying all devices together seamlessly An example may help Currently my mobile phone connects to the Internet either through G or through WiFi With a G system my mobile phone could connect through a phone base station a home gateway device another mobile phone an IoT device a car gateway all seamlessly without me being aware that Im moving from one to the other My G system will be virtualized across multiple hardware devices Data will come and go across multiple types of connections simultaneously The G system will find the path of least resistance and send packets of data along various paths to later be reconnected and delivered This is similar to the current Internet Theres no isolated path that all of your data takes to get from you to its destination Data finds its way through various compute devices across the system and is reunited as it is delivered This concept brings new meaning to the Internet of Things The Things intelligent devices are actually the Internet connectivity The Things are the connection to other Things G G and G were wireless innovations focused largely on improving the speed and efficiency of a connection between point A a cellular network antenna and point B your cellphone or other device G also is about faster and more efficient wireless connectivity but this time it is also about computing capability The industry is looking to G to provide the higher data rates Gbps lower latency and capacity needed to enable the Internet of Things IoT new service models and immersive user experiences This will require immense processing and communications power provided by sophisticated silicon solutions Working in partnership with leading operators we developed the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>G Mobile Trial Platform to offer the mobile industry a flexible and highperformance development platform that allows for faster integration and testing of G networks and devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is taking a leading role in development of G so that its solutions can effectively become the standard for the industry as G is rolled out The European Union is hot on taking the lead in G The EU has funded huge efforts to implement a G system throughout the EU Heres a graphic that describes the EU vision for G <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working hand in hand with the EU My thought is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is staying very general on G glossy videos and broad motherhood statements and has a backroom secret project that will take the world by storm Its either that or its all fluff and no substance Place your bets A G Network is Possible Now on <span

</span>Architecture processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offers the building blocks needed for network transformation and has emerged with a leading role in the future G network This link has an article G A Network Transformation Imperative describing how Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Architecture will be essential to make G work Note that last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said by there would be some billion things connected to the Internet Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is saying over billion devices connected to the Internet by This reduction indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is taking a more realistic view of the future with regard to connected devices I think they are looking to see fewer and more capable things The reader is reminded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides numerous devices that could all contribute to the effectiveness of G These devices are from endtoend and include pretty much all hardware in data centers pretty much all desktop PCs a large percentage of gateways broadband and cable almost all laptopsins and some mobile devices Experience working with all of these devices from endtoend is essential to providing an overall G solution Security is critical to a successful G network <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offers physical channel authentication and virtualized authentication through its hardware and software endtoend solutions Unfortunately G is yet another program by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that will require a substantial investment over years before it delivers a meaningful return in the form of earnings If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is extremely successful in G and delivers a secret system that will form a backbone for G then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could start seeing substantial earnings from G in the time period A more likely scenario is that significant earnings from G do not appear until or Earlier earnings for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely come as service providers prepare their data center systems to compete as G service providers I continue to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
