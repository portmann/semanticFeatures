PRO had an early look at this article Learn more about PRO The prime catalyst for the recent rally in INVN has been completely missed by the media and it signals an impending event for InvenSense Google is rumored to have made a move which may signal an eventual change in its tactics with respect to IoT Apples approach is completely different and its success would not be good for InvenSenses longterm prospects This is an article about how I was wrong To explain I will take a step back and look at the big picture playing out in the evolving technology landscape with respect to IoT the Internet of Things Major players each with their own strengths and weaknesses are making moves to stake out their claims to this new world where all devices are interconnected The intrigues rival those in the hit series Game of Thrones When taken together with a key development that explains the recent stock movement for InvenSense NYSE INVN they also give clues to the futures of each of the companies involved and device technology in general But back to where I was wrong Two months ago I projected that InvenSense should report EPS of at least cents on revenue of M Instead on May th the company reported inline earnings of cents per share though it did beat my base earnings projection and average analyst estimates with revenue of M In response INVN began a steady decline over the next month before reaching a shortterm bottom just below By contrast on April th Apple NASDAQ AAPL EPS of beat average analyst projections by cents and revenue of of b also beat by a whopping b Although AAPL has hit alltime highs on the success of its latest phones those highs still dont really represent the breakout I was looking for Then in early June InvenSense filed this S document which got no attention at all in the press At first glance it looks like InvenSense is simply increasing the share count in order to continue the employee incentive plan On closer inspection though the increase seems too large million which is over dilution even though InvenSense is a bigger company than it was just a few years ago due to acquisitions last year Dilution is never a good thing and ordinarily this would be a negative Instead INVN immediately began a sharp ascent back up to which is the midpoint of its prior trading range Shorted shares represented over of INVN float as of the end of May I see the change in trend as primarily driven by short covering because the share count increase in the S document signals an impending transaction for InvenSense to short sellers and other smart money Exactly what InvenSense plans to do with over M in new stock is uncertain but the most likely possibility is another acquisition Whether or not a new transaction will ultimately be seen as a positive is entirely dependent on the details Often buyouts are used by management to gain time via Goodwill and the vagaries of software revenue accounting Regardless no seasoned shortseller would simply wait to find out The rebate rate is now near probably indicating that the process has a little bit further to go but is expiring rather than accelerating The countermarket movements weve been seeing are also typical of covering and its not uncommon to see the largest moves in stock price towards the end of the process I expect that the bimonthly shorted float figures to be released on June th will give further confirmation to my interpretation The increase in open interest on INVN calls that others have noted is a byproduct of this development since the calls essentially minimize risk for a premium in price The September issues are particularly popular for another reason though the introduction of the next set of iPhones With Apple constituting between one half and one third of InvenSenses revenue it should be obvious that inclusion in or exclusion from the next set of iPhones will dominate the nearterm prospects for InvenSense Thats a real concern because the Apple Watch showed another way that I was wrong in that it demonstrated that the crosslicensing agreement with STMicro NYSE STM enabled that longtime Apple supplier to create knockoff chips to compete with InvenSense products That in turn gives Apple more leverage to continue using its cash hoard like the Bank of Bravos effectively squeezing counterparties with through volume contract negotiations InvenSense is responding by trying to win mindshare which is an area where I think Apple may have hidden weakness InvenSense will host its Developer Conference next week and the program is rumored to have tens of thousands of members This is how both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT came to dominate the early years of personal computing by owning the instruction sets that were used by others to innovate new products to the market However it remains to be seen which players will succeed and fail in their bids for success with IoT My thinking is that its success for InvenSense in mobile ultimately boils down to a question of whether innovation is going to be driven by megacorporations which control either directly or indirectly through volume negotiations their entire supply chains or by smaller more inventive entities If its the former then much software and other design will be done inhouse and InvenSenses development will continue to be commoditized in the short term and eventually marginalized altogether To hedge its bets InvenSense recently introduced the Shuttle program to foster new innovation Shuttle will allow not just mobile developers but innovators in automotive smarthome and other industries to fabricate their own custom chips on InvenSenses patented InvenSense Fabrication MEMSCMOS integrated platform Targeting new markets signals InvenSenses ambition to evolve from a company with a billion dollar market capitalization to tens or even hundreds of billions but it also increases expense and execution risk On the operating system side Google NASDAQ GOOGL development is headed in complementary directions The introduction of Brillo at Googles IO conference is just the latest data point supporting that statement Compatibility with Android has been a long time feature of InvenSense products for the mobile space and that should begin to show in operating results towards the end of this year as Asian manufacturers begin to adopt new FireFly products If management can execute on its statements about doubling content which would certainly require another iPhone design win then my price target still makes sense Beyond that though InvenSense will face increasing competition as it attempts to grow into new territory The recent announcement of a collaboration between Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE TSM and Cadence Design Systems NASDAQ CDNS poses a real threat to the Shuttle program as it will allow for similar customization of SoCs system on chips Id actually suggested a tie up between Cadence and InvenSense in this article and the ultralow power voice trigger mentioned in the Cadence announcement is one of the features Id looked to see InvenSense develop Unless such the two companies do start cooperating they will find themselves stepping on one anothers toes more and more often over time The signs seem to indicate that InvenSense is maintaining a meaningful the lead in the software arms race but in the maneuvering to gain a bigger share of the IoT future I think that hardware capabilities are the dragons It was an unmatchable hardware design advantage that first propelled InvenSense from a startup to a company that supplies every major mobile device maker but InvenSense will eventually face competition in that area as well Nextgeneration sensor designer Lumedyne has been acquired some think by Google though this is unconfirmed While Lumedynes website makes lots of reference to Time Domain Switched sensor technology I think the real prize here is the companys optoelectrical sensor designs and Vpower technology Although technology like this typically takes years to be commercialized and often never winds up seeing the light of day I think its an area where Google is slowly building an edge that will complement its vast platform reach Googles approach of selecting early and then allowing technology to still be developed with a fair degree of independence is in marked contrast to Apples recent more expensive and controlling efforts Still having the inside track on new hardware integration up through the operating system level should be a vital component to staying relevant with verticallyintegrated companies like Samsung For InvenSense it shows that no lead or ally is forever On a possibly related note InvenSenses founder and its former VP of Marketing and Business Development are now part of a startup called NextInput which has developed a force sensitive touch technology It bears mentioning but I dont see wonderful synergies here and wouldnt be impressed if this turned out to be the transaction Im anticipating Whats so great about the rest of the InvenSense business is that it provides input and improved user experience WITHOUT conscious user interaction My impression is that the ForceTouch technology is still a ways off and with execution risk already increasing NextInput is just not what I see InvenSense needing at this juncture A different hardware tie up could help InvenSense truly leap forward again but it is still a relatively small player in a shifting landscape The chance that large industry players will buy InvenSense in the race to compete remains MA has certainly been in vogue lately but Ive never been very willing to count on that alone for any stock Sometimes being cautious and learning from your mistakes can be just as important as being right Source InvenSense Apple Google And The Game Of IoThrones Disclosure I amwe are long INVN MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
