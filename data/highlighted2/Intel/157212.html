style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has unveiled the best reference design for Apples longrumored iPad Pro highend tablet Unlike Apples A processor Intels x processor is compatible with industry standard software like AutoCAD and Adobe Photoshop KGI Securities analyst MingChi Kuo again hinted that Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPad Pro will go into commercial production next month or by October Kuo also said the inch iPad Pro will come with a Force Touchenabled Stylus The inclusion of a stylus is a clue that Apple intends to market the iPad Pro to the creative industry Unfortunately in spite of Kuos Applerelated scoops he has yet to provide us with an official renderpicture of the alleged iPad Pro On this note may I dare say then that Intels NASDAQ INTC new reference design for nextgeneration in tablets could also serve as a reference for the iPad Pro Below is a screenshot of Intels latest reference design for in tabletnotebook The aesthetics rendition of Intels new reference design somehow mimics the iPad Air only thicker Intels concept design features wireless charging wireless display mirroring fingerprint sensor TouchID USB Type C connectors DD capturesharing and an Active stylus Intels hypothetical iPad Pro design is also similar to the highend Wacom Cintiq products Cintiq products are often used by professional artists and media editors They are priced even higher than Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro The Cintiq Companion with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core i and MB GB of storage sells for Apple is known for selling highpriced hardware and the alleged iPad Pro will also come with a foure price tag The persistent rumor of a highend iPad Pro can lead to Apple being forced to use an x processor from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Up until now Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Autodesk NASDAQ ADSK and Apple has yet to find a way on how to recompile full versions of xonly industry standard software Photoshop CC AutoCAD Final Cut Pro so they will work on ARMbased processors like Apples A Graphic artists will deride a Apple iPad Pro that cannot even run Adobe Photoshop CC or Illustrator CC That is now the predicament of Apple Without full compatibility with xx software a inch iPad Pro is just a glorified iPad Air Its only purpose would be to run light duty tasks such as Office applications The surging sales of Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface should motivate Apple to really come up with a neutralizer The majority of creativedesign professionals will only give serious thoughts of buying an iPad Pro if it runs native x industry standard programs The ideal iPad Pro therefore should be a detachable version of the fanless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CoreM powered MacBook It ought to run Mac OS X not iOS have an stylus and touchscreen support and a Core i processor Other Tablet OEMs Will Offer Cheaper Clones Of Surface Another positive scenario is that Intels more expensive processors will find new buyers eager to copycat the Surface Pro Using the new reference design from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Asus can create a very pricey inch Windows version of the ZenPad S Android tablet The inch ZenPad S has GB of RAM GB of flash storage microSD slot and a Stylus It only needs a bigger display size an upgrade to a Core ii processor and a change to Windows OS to become a potent rival to the Surface Pro and Cintiq Companion Other PC manufacturers will also eventually make a cheaper clone of the Surface The nature of the computer industry is for companies to always imitate the successful and popular Microsoft is planning to release the Surface Pro later this year The combined threat of top OEMs creating affordable Surface detachable tabletin clones and Microsoft pushing for Surface and Surface Pro could hurt Apples iPadMacBook sales For those creative professionals that do not rely on Apples Final Cut Pro or Logic buying a WindowsIntel hybrid in tablet is obviously more cost effective than buying an ARMbased iPad Pro in tandem with a MacBook Apple Should Also Compete With The Surface Microsofts success with the stylusenabled Surface proved that there is a multibilliondollar market for expensive Intelpowered tablets Intels latest reference design is a good template for Apple to create its own flagship iPad Pro tablet that can match the features of the Cintiq and Surface Pro Apple can improve on Intels design to suit its own vision for the iPad Pro Apple can remove the secondary inch eink display from Intels design but keep the best features like the inclusion of a fullside SD card slot and wireless charging Intels leaked SkylakeU processor roadmap revealed that more energy efficient processors are coming soon as alternatives to current CoreM products If Apple is still not satisfied with current offerings of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for its iPad Pro next years releases of SkylakeU might finally deliver an Intelpowered iPad The best benefit an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processor getting inside the Apple iPad Pro is that is always better to sell highermargin processors to manufacturers who have a track record of selling highend products in figure volumes Intels bottomline could improve if Apple starts making bulk orders of the to Skylake processors bound for the iPad Pro or in version of the MacBook Apple is allegedly already sold on using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE modems inside some of its upcoming iPhone S <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>again benefits if Apple would use a highpriced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoC for its iPad Pro The global brand power of Apple makes me believe that an Intelpowered iPad Pro could outsell the Surface Pro by leaps and bounds xtox bigger sales volume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains an attractive longterm investment This company is not in any danger of extinction in this age of mobile devices and smart things The universal appeal of Intels x processor for mobile and pc products is that it works with almost all operating systems This is something that ARMbased CPU producers cannot claim Take for example the new Jolla tablet Instead of using an ARMbased SoC the people behind the Jolla tablet opted to use an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>quadcore processor because it works well with the Sailfish mobile operating system Sailfish is also
