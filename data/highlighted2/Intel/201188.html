<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>No Longer A PC Company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>beat thirdquarter EPS estimates but the stock fell at the open anyway This could be because INTC continues to struggle in PCs historically its main business But that could be changing The companys fastestgrowing and most profitable operating segment is now data centers For this reason investors may want to change how they think of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and view INTC as predominantly a data center company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC beat earnings expectations when the company released its Q report but the stock was down more than at the open on Wednesday Investors dont appear too impressed with Intels results probably because the company still posted declines in revenue and earnings per share on a yearoveryear basis For most of its history Intels chips catered primarily to the PC industry But global PC shipments are now declining by doubledigit rates and repeatedly poor performance in its core PC business continues to drag <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>down Fortunately INTC does have a highgrowth business data centers that has the potential to be its most important business going forward For this reason it may be appropriate to no longer view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a PC company Investors have been hoping to see any sort of recovery in underlying PC demand but operating conditions in the PC industry have continued to deteriorate throughout After a very weak start to the year analysts widely attributed the declines in PC shipments over the first half of the year to the pending release of Windows It was widely thought that PC sales would recover in the third quarter Consumers and businesses who had postponed buying new PCs were supposedly going to boost PC shipments once the new Windows product hit store shelves Unfortunately poor PC sales continued in the third quarter According to technology market research firm IDC PC shipments fell last quarter year over year That figure widely missed analyst expectations which called for a more modest decline Such an alarming deterioration in the PC this year is a real problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which still derives about of its revenue from its Client Computing Group which is predominantly PCs Of course Intels newly restructured reporting schedule has combined the PC business with the mobile business although success in mobile continues to elude the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich had little to say about mobile on the conference call except that the company remains on track to improve mobile profitability by million this year That sounds great until investors recall Intels mobile business lost a whopping billion last year so improving that by million is hardly a cause for celebration While the PC business continues to stagnate and the mobile business posting big losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>desperately needs a catalyst Thankfully for investors INTC has a fantastic catalyst for growth on its hands in the form of its data centers business which continues to impress both in terms of growth and profitability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>grew revenue in data centers by last quarter year over year Revenue in data centers hit a record billion This performance even beat the Internet of Things which posted a solid yearoveryear revenue growth rate Not only is the data centers business Intels fastestgrowing on a yearoveryear basis but its also the companys most profitable by far Operating profit grew in data centers last quarter year over year Meanwhile operating profit in the Client Computing Group fell by year over year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>realized a operating profit margin in data centers compared to for client computing and in the Internet of Things Margins are outstanding in data centers and considering the huge problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has had reversing massive losses in mobile there is something to be said for profitability right now Going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could very well reap additional profits in data centers as a result of the billion acquisition of Altera NASDAQ ALTR Bringing in Altera presents an opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to expand its presence in fieldprogrammable gate arrays or FPGAs particularly in data centers The transaction remains on track to close in the original sixtonine month window provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management Separately the cloud is a forward catalyst for data centers While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management expects a moderate slowdown in data center demand at the enterprise level continued strength in the cloud fuels managements expectation for lowdoubledigit growth in data center revenue for the full year Its difficult to come up with a buy thesis for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>right now The stock is cheap at times earnings but its cheap for a reason Its flagship PC business is eroding due to the continued structural shift in how people compute The shift from desktops and laptops toward mobile devices like smartphones does not appear to be reversing anytime soon And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still flailing in its efforts to meaningfully penetrate the mobile arena That leaves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and its investors wanting for a catalyst Fortunately the Internet of Things and more importantly data centers could be just what investors are looking for Intels data center business is its highestgrowing operating segment and it also carries huge margins For this reason investors should keep more of their focus on what happens to data centers going forward and view any surprise recover in PC shipments as a nice bonus Disclaimer This article represents the opinion of the author
