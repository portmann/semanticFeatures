Seattle Dead On Arrival Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article AMD finally released its ARMbased Seattle chips after a yearlong delay The chips lag Intels twoyear Atom offerings according to Anandtech Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD is making headlines across the tech blogosphere with the longawaited release of its ARMbased Seattle chips that have been delayed by almost a year now The tech community may be rejoicing the maturing ARM ecosystem in the datacenter segment with this release but I believe there is little to cheer about for AMD shareholders with a longterm picture in mind To put it bluntly Seattle chips may be downright irrelevant and incompetent right at their release Let me start by saying that in the cutthroat semiconductor industry even a few months of delay can make or break the prospects of a product or a company But the release of AMD Seattle chips is about a full year late than its originally planned schedule The company and its management may get some points for finally delivering on its longanticipated Seattle chips and for showing to the world that AMD still has some fight left but the delayed chips wont necessarily bring in any meaningful business for the troubled chipmaker To put things in perspective over the course of the past year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has moved to nm lithography while justreleased Seattle chips are being manufactured using a nm fabrication process This huge delay has seemingly impaled AMDs efforts to enter the server business right from the start Technology review site Anandtech reports that the newlyreleased Seattle chips are about slower and drain more power compared to Intels twoyear old Silvermontbased Atom chips in spite of having similar price points <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is scheduled to release Goldmontbased Atom chips next year which would represent an architectural jump of two generations If these Seattle chips cant compete with Intels twoyear old chips in terms of performance or pricing at the time of their release how can we expect them to compete and stay relevant against their larger counterparts upcoming offerings It just doesnt make any sense pay the same price to purchase technologically inferior AMD product for building expensive hyperscale data centers As I explained in my previous article the only real edge AMD has over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>right now is its semicustom offerings It would theoretically allow AMD to tailor its ARMbased chips as per the specific needs of its clients and give it an upper hand over the competition But that is missing from Seattle chips Dan Bounds Senior Director of data center products at AMD just noted that custom ARM chips will be available with its next CPU architectures termed as Zen and K which are still one to two years away from massproduction Without the custom ARM chips there isnt much reason to pick AMD over its other ARMbased competitors or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for that matter Purchasing decisions would be made on benchmarks run on standard chips and their pricing Since AMDs Seattle doesnt offer any significant performance gains over existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offerings I believe that AMD would have to lower its prices to become competitive in the segment This could lead to lost revenue and lower profitability Enterprise clients may also purposely delay their projects and wait for Intels upcoming Denverton chips about months away from massrelease and make their purchase only after conducting thorough comparisons and testing In essence AMDs nm Seattle chips will be competing with Intels upcoming nm Goldmontbased chips This could make Seattle chips an even tougher sell Altogether the aforementioned factors present a very bleak outlook for AMDs Seattle chips The competition within the ARMbased server segment is fierce as well First off the market for ARM microservers is still in its nascent stages and there arent many vendors that offer ARMbased systems Cavium NASDAQ CAVM and Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC dominate the segment and have forged ties with server makers and enterprise clients so displacing them right away may not be entirely possible with a generic ARM architecture Secondly new entrants are expected to come in going forward For instance Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM recently entered the ARM server race with its core processor which could reportedly house more cores by the time the company starts its massproduction Qualcomm can potentially bring its mobile expertise and technology into the server segment and achieve higher economies of scale as a result of that AMD will have to form ties with server vendors and enterprise clients and prove to them that its offerings are better than its other ARMbased competitors in terms of price and performance This could be a long shot as the troubled semiconductor company will have to compete with its yearold Seattle architecture until its K comes into massproduction I just dont see Seattle chips as credible contenders in the server segment due to the aforementioned reasons At best without any real performance and pricing advantages over its competitors Seattle chips may just end up being just a testing platform for enterprise clients But that doesnt necessarily mean that AMD cant ever crack the ARMbased server market The company may be able to fiercely compete in the ARM segment if its K release is at a lower and competitive node released in a timely manner and offers semi custom chips to offer flexibility for enterprise clients </div></body></html>
