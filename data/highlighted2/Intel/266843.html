Reasons Why IBM Is A Better Investment Than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>At Least For The Next Two Years International Business Machines Corporation NYSEIBM Seeking Alpha IBMs stock is depressed compared to Intels stock IBMs conversion to cloud analytics and services is almost complete Both IBM NYSE IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC are huge hightech companies with market values well over B Both companies have been developing new products that they hope will expand their sales and profits and conceivably they could both be successful So why do I prefer IBM as an investment Its because I think over the next two years IBM has a much better chance of both improving its profits and expanding its PE ratio enough to achieve at least a gain in price In Intels case I think the next two years will not allow it time enough to generate substantial profits from new products due to the longer cycle for new technologies to take requisite market share As for Intels legacy products I see considerable competition arising in both desktop and server markets over the next two years IBMs key financial ratios are subdued Intels are higher than historical values This is a key reason for liking IBM Based upon historical financial metrics IBM is undervalued at its current price of about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand at about appears to be overvalued based upon historical averages Now one could argue that is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a better defined future but I think just the opposite IBMs transition to services analytics and the cloud are highgrowth areas that will allow it to turn around in the next two years albeit after lower sales for straight quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does have some promising products in the pipeline such as D Xpoint but I question whether they will generate substantial sales and profit growth between now and the end of IBMs Gross Margins GM will be expanding while Intels will inevitably be lower IBM has slowly been inching its GM up from to over the last few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>of course is famous for its plus margins But Intels high margins come from huge capex and RD spending compared to IBMs IBM actually has had more free cash flow over the last four quarters B to B That makes IBMs pricefree cash flow ratio vs Intels Over the next two years as IBM disgorges their hardware legacy charges and ramps up analytics software and services the GM should continue to rise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand is facing competition in of their business provided by their semimonopoly desktops and servers ARM servers are coming although slower than I surmised originally but certainly by Desktops will have some of their first competition in years with AMDs release of their new chip Zen in late IoT and mobile will continue to be low margin products for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because they are low margin products for everyone For example Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM GM net of the license revenue is see K Page And one of the major suppliers of IoT chips Qorvo NASDAQ QRVO has a GM of less than So as mobile and IoT become a greater percentage of sales then Intels GM will be going down One possible exception is D Xpoint but I do not think it will be a significant percentage of sales in the next two years And of course McAfee Intels woeful B software acquisition should be a high margin product but has been plagued with a myriad of problems In fact on Oct th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced it would no longer sell McAffee email SaaS and instead recommended customers purchase threat detection software Proofpoint In a similar vein to GE as expressed in this article Reasons Why General Electric Has Much Bigger IoT Potential Than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Does IBM has more potential for highmargin IoT sales via software consulting cloud and data analytics than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does And like GE but even more so IBM already has a facetoface relationship with many large organizations via its mainframes software and services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has that kind of relationship with only a few large organizations and its not known for its cloud consulting software analytics or services like IBM is Therefore Intels IoT revenue will be mainly hardware related via servers more data means more servers and perhaps some low margin chips Intels IoT group is increasing sales but at less than half the rate of the IoT market in general For the first three quarters of compared to the IoT Groups sales are up B vs B but operating income was actually down M vs M For more on Intels IoT potential see this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Internet Of Things Will Not Provide Significant Sales For The Foreseeable Future Both IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are cash flow machines and both have opportunities for increasing the value of their stock price Both have big buybacks in place and both have several new products ramping up in the next two years Both stocks could easily go up by over the next two years but I think IBM with its depressed price and highmargin new products has the best chance We only use your contact details to reply to your request
