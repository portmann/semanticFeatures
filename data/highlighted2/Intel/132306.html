positioned to dominate new markets than Amazoncom When it fails to seize opportunities is when you sell not before Considered the great publicist of Reaganomics in the early s Stockman later renounced the policy called trickle down by critics because he is at heart an Austrian economist often seeing moral lessons in markets that in my view simply dont exist Like many other writers here at Seeking Alpha Stockman persists in seeing Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN as a bubble stock one that is priced completely at odds with its intrinsic value and is just waiting to be swept away in a general market downturn He feels the same about the rest of the FANG Facebook NASDAQ FB Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL These companies have repeatedly made big moves up on earnings over the last year absolutely huge moves The stocks work when nothing else seems to He sees such moves as irrational exuberance absolutely reminiscent of final days before the tech wreck exactly years ago Maybe But I was covering technology years ago I warned about the tech bubble for three years before it finally popped with the AOL acquisition of Time Warner NYSE TWX Remember that AOL stockholders got a majority stake in the resulting company This is not the same thing The dotbomb took down hundreds of stocks and hundreds of companies because the sector couldnt keep all those balls in the air These latest moves being isolated in just a few stocks are an acknowledgement of settled leadership the idea being that these companies are now dominant in a sector of the market that is transforming the general economy If youre looking for bubbles I think you should look at biotech Stockman compares the FANG stocks with Cisco NASDAQ CSCO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Juniper NYSE JNPR which peaked with the dotcom bubble and which while they continued to grow never recovered their earlier allure to investors and may never do so He fails to understand that these companies he could have easily added Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT to the list subsequently failed in mobile failed in cloud and failed in devices the industries that followed that of the basic Internet onto the stage They were of the moment they failed to see over the horizon When the FANG outfits do the same thats when you sell them Not before Stockmans argument about Amazon like that of others here is based on the idea that profits are minimal and so is free cash flow In particular he derides Amazon Web Services the cloud subsidiary that dominates cloud infrastructure He fails to understand that infrastructure is to cloud what operating systems were to computers back in the day that controlling the base of the market confers enormous longlasting advantages By his reasoning Microsoft was a bubble stock in Heres an example of what I mean Netflix rides on Amazon infrastructure This gives Amazon enormous visibility into Netflixs operations and opportunities visibility it has used in building its own studio operation out of Amazon Prime Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw this possibility coming and spent billions of dollars to create a cloud infrastructure independent of Amazon maybe thats why Amazon isnt more competitive in social Maybe thats why I dont own any Netflix I admit that at its present level Amazon is fully valued But for all Amazons current success it has far more opportunities than the other FANG members to get more Amazon is going to win in India Its going to extend its lead with cloud into platforms and software It is going to become a major studio It will be able to monetize search in ways Google cant imagine The outfit is betterpositioned than any other company to take advantage of the cloudanddevice era we entered five years ago better positioned to take advantage of global urbanization and for that matter better positioned for the Internet of Things era that will follow the current decade I saw that when Amazon was at and Ive profited handsomely The market has now caught up At current prices further gains depend on Amazon achieving some of the goals Ive mentioned But generational leadership in business is a rare thing to see I wouldnt have sold Exxon NYSE XOM short in the s I wouldnt have sold GM NYSE GM short in the s I wouldnt have sold GE NYSE GE short in the s and Im not going to short FANG now Source Market
