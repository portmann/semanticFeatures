generation iPhone will be little changed Kuos predictions have helped fuel pessimism about Apple A survey of Kuos longer range predictions shows that they are often inaccurate The bearish view that Apples NASDAQ AAPL next iPhone will lack innovation has found support in the predictions of highly regarded analyst MingChi Kuo However a survey of Kuos predictions over the past couple of years reveals he is far from perfect even if he is the best of the Apple analysts Moreover his longer term predictions such as for the iPhone tend to be the least accurate A recent article by SA contributor Paulo Santos projected that the iPhone would be the iPhone that Steve Jobs would have wanted Since the article relied substantially on the predictions of KGI Securities analyst MingChi Kuo I decided to take a hard look at the accuracy of Kuos predictions since the beginning of Kuo enjoys a high reputation among analysts and is often referred to as an insider whatever that means It is thought that he has widespread contacts in Apples supply chain and it has even been rumored within Apple itself Kuo predictions regarding a iPhone were published in a note to investors on March Apple Insider was provided a copy of the note as it has been consistently over the past few years According to the note the iPhone would revert to the glass sandwich design of the iPhone s but use curved glass front and back similar to the Samsung OTCSSNLF Galaxy S Edge which is also a glass sandwich It would also have other features of the Edge including a large inch screen the Edge has a inch screen a curved AMOLED display and wireless charging It is perhaps not coincidence that the S series was released on March A month later Kuo issued another note concerning iPhone He stated that it would not have many attractive selling points and reiterated his pessimistic projection of below million iPhone sales for He indicated that iPhone needs a makeover which he reiterated is coming with the model Kuo has made a number of predictions regarding the iPhone The first was on September in which he predicted that it would be the thinnest iPhone ever at millimeters This prompted one of the earliest and most attractive of the iPhone concepts shown at the top of the article This concept has more or less been dropped by most sites as they have embraced the little or no change rumors about iP In fact the reduction in thickness however executed would be a significant design change as Ive pointed out In subsequent research notes Kuo has predicted that iP would feature GB of RAM for the Plus model as well as his prediction on April of iPhone shipments in calendar below million units due to soft iPhone SE demand and slow sales of iPhone s As of this date none of Kuos predictions regarding iPhone can be verified Lacking the ability to assess the current crop of iP and iP predictions from Kuo I decided to do the next best thing which is look systematically at his predictions over the past couple of years In this I was aided by the fact that Apple Insider has assiduously published capsule summaries of his research notes A search of MingChi Kuo on the Apple Insider site showed what I assume to be a complete list of his notes going back several years Starting April I tabulated all the reported predictions and graded them for accuracy on a scale of whenever the prediction outcomes were known It was a tedious process since there were more than predictions up to the present In some cases Kuos research notes merely reiterated previous predictions and these were usually omitted from the grading process Ive included a summary table of the predictions with links to the Apple Insider articles appended to the end of the article since the table is so long Kuos research notes often contain numerous predictions on a broad range of topics Often Apple Insider broke these up into a number of separate articles all published on the same day Rather than try to enumerate each separate prediction Ive gone with Apple Insiders grouping of them by article and assigned a grade on an articlebyarticle basis Even within an article there would typically be or separate predictions In my grading I gave partial credit where some of the predictions were correct The overall average I arrived at was which would amount to a B letter grade Not particularly good in absolute terms but probably better than anyone else Certainly better than what I would score I will concede There have been some significant prediction flops grade of For instance on April Kuo predicted that a low cost iMac would be released in Q There was no such iMac and in fact the only new iMac introduction was the higher end K iMac released in October Similarly on March Kuo predicted that Watch would ship with three new case materials by the Fall in addition to the aluminum stainless steel and gold already shown There were no such new case materials Often Kuos predictions are most accurate for events only a few days in the future For instance on September Kuo predicted that the iWatch would be unveiled at the September iPhone launch event and launch in early This turned out to be correct On October Kuo predicted that the iPad Air and a Retina display iMac would launch at the October Special Event They did Up until his predictions about iPhone Kuo had not tried to make predictions of Apple products more than a generation removed from the current products This should give investors pause given that his accuracy necessarily declines as the time delay increases My personal take on the iPhone prediction is that it was very influenced by the release of the Samsung Galaxy S a couple of weeks before Kuo concluded that the S represented the direction that Apple needed to go My point in grading Kuo is not to diminish his accomplishments He is still the best of Apple analysts My point is to show the difficulty of making accurate predictions in light of Apples secrecy and the overall lack of reliable information regarding future products In addition to the prediction difficulties assertions of what Steve Jobs would do in the current circumstances are highly suspect Jobs was rather mercurial and more than capable of overturning past decisions Even though Jobs died in October a year before the release of iPhone he probably had reviewed early design concepts for it and endorsed that change in design direction I frankly doubt that Apple is ever going back to the glass sandwich given all the complaints about its fragility The supposed changes in iPhone have been used by Apple critics to substantiate the claim that iPhone lacks innovation Its an interesting strategy given that predictions about a iPhone are necessarily weak My interpretation has been that Apple is more likely moving away from the two year ticktock design cycle to a one year cycle I dont claim to have certain knowledge of Apple product plans but have simply observed that the claims about iPhone run contrary to Apples continuing innovation in processors and operating systems That processor innovation drives the ability to innovate in other areas such as screen size and the thinness of the device The one Kuo prediction about iPhone that I believe is accurate is that the device will be about a millimeter thinner Rather than rushing to judgment that everybody hates iPhone Im taking a wait and see attitude I recommend investors do the same I remain long Apple and rate it a buy for investors with a year investment horizon iWatch to be released in sizes in Q with flexible AMOLED display to
