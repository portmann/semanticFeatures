NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha There was a recent article claiming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shouldnt be worried if Apple starts using its own processors in its Mac line The reasons for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needing to worry are numerous and such a move by AAPL could actually be catastrophic for INTC What prompted me to write this was Alpha Maxs article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Shouldnt Worry If Apple Excludes It From Future Macs where he argues that even if Apple NASDAQ AAPL decides to switch some of its Macs to its own CPUs that wouldnt be much trouble for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Alpha Max also argues that it wouldnt be much trouble because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could get a chance to go inside Apples iPhones and nextgeneration iPads I dont agree <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should be worried if this Apple switching some Macs to its own CPUs ever happens Indeed it should be very worried about the chance of it ever happening And this is so for several reasons Let me explain The case for Apple switching is easy Buying CPUs from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is wildly more expensive than using its own CPUsSoCs While the typical <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>laptop CPU can cost hundreds of dollars the typical housesourced foundryproduced ARMlicensed SoC will cost around a couple of dozen dollars savings on the CPU front wouldnt be impossible if Apple could make the change So the incentive exists and is large Furthermore shifting all its lines mobile laptops desktops to ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH ARM architecture would present a couple of other significant advantages including Controlling a chief differentiator in its hardware as it now does within the mobile space Building its own SoCs allows Apple to keep an advantage over competitors which these except possibly for Samsung OTCSSNLF havent been able to close yet Losing the ability to run Windows on the same machines which might still ease the transition for some Windows users And losing backwards compatibility which Apple could easily remove in its own software but which would still be present for thirdparty applications However all of this is held back by the fact that such a switch would need to at least match the performance of the present <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs In this regard its significant that Apple is already claiming the ability of its AX Apple SoC to compare favorably with some of Intels mobile CPUs This is even more relevant because the AX isnt yet a part thats optimized for the laptopdesktop environment which would still lend it further performance Anyway the main stumbling block for Apple would be this performance And in the plus department youd find many reasons cost and thus product margins being the main one Still if Apple were to switch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would see an immediate loss of a large customer now representing nearly of the entire PC market This would already be a reason for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to worry Were Apple to switch to its own CPUs several things would happen all of which would affect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Other laptopdesktop competitors would instantly pressure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for lowerpriced parts to be able to compete with Apples newfound lowercost competitiveness Since Apple does not hold a lock on the abilities of the ARM platform other manufacturers would develop the underlying ARM tech along with ARM itself to provide similar levels of performance Indeed a seed of this can already be seen in AMDs NASDAQ AMD and Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM efforts And right afterwards they too would drop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to adopt these new and much cheaper SoCs in their products Since the previous dynamic would be evident Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT would quickly be forced to issue full Windows versions for that new hardware All in all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would initially see margin pressure from the pricing pressure to be followed by volume and margin pressure from a large migration toward ARMpowered laptops and desktops The migration would happen even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>yielded to the initial pricing pressure simply because the cost differentials are so large <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could never cover them through pricing concessions In short Apple moving to its own ARMbased CPU designs could well spell catastrophe for INTC due to the dynamics it would set in motion This risk didnt exist previously when Apple used PowerPC and Motorola CPUs simply because those were not cheaper the way ARM designs are today Regarding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>being inside the iPhones and iPads that just seems to be some sort of confusion The A is not made by Samsung or TSMC NYSE TSM They just produce it theyre contract foundries a sort of highertech contract manufacturer But the design is Apples and those SoCs are as much Apples as AMDs CPUs are AMDs no matter if theyre produced by GlobalFoundries or TSMC or Samsung or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In this case if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>got any work from Apple it would be simple foundry work which would give it a fraction of the sales and margins that it would lose if Apple were to migrate its Macs to its own SoCs This article does not mean I think such a migration away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is about to happen over at Apple I dont think such is imminent But to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shouldnt be worried about it is in my view entirely wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does need to be worried about it Not just because of what Apple represents to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in terms of direct sales but also due to the pricing pressure and possible stampede such a move could incite in the rest of the tech world PC laptop and desktop makers cannot afford to compete with Apple if it gets access to CPUs that are potentially cheaper so theyd be also forced to migrate if AAPL ever did
