NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha After the Microsoft snub I was wrong to say that Intels Atom x will only get bought by Chinese whitebox phone vendors Cherry Mobile the largest smartphone vendor in the Philippines is using the Atom x for a sub Android phone SNS Network a Malaysian firm has also released an Atom xpowered Android phone Cherry Mobile the biggest vendor of smartphones in the Philippines recently launched two new tablets and one Android smartphone powered by Intels NASDAQ INTC Atom x processors The new MAIA brand of tablets and phone from Cherry Mobile is exclusively using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x processors I was therefore wrong to think that since Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT snubbed the Atom x for its latest Lumia entrylevel Windows phone Intels Gonly Atom x would only have Chinese phone manufacturers for a client Cherry Mobiles launch of the MAIA series helps fortify my faith over Intels future in smartphone application processors Partnering with Cherry Mobile and local brands that are successful in their respective countries gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a chance to sell some more of its Genabled Atom x chips Cherry Mobile first teamed up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>last year with Windows tablets and smartphones The Intelpowered Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph and Alpha Play Windows tablets were very successful here in the Philippines What I can surmise now is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>likely told Cherry Mobile to create the MAIA branding to help distinguish Atom xpowered devices from Cherry Mobiles other ARMbased Android devices The MAIA Fone i is a inch Android OS dualSIM smartphone with MB of RAM and GB ROM It has a microSD slot dual camera and G HSPA connectivity It uses the nm GHz quadcore bit Atom x SoC made by Rockchip The MAIA Fone i retails for pesos in Manila The MAIA Fone i is therefore much cheaper than the cheapest Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragonpowered Windows smartphone the Alpha Neon also from Cherry Mobile The peso MAIA Pad is a inch Android tablet with GB of RAM and Atom x It is almost as cheap as Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Fire Tablet Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is unlikely to be making any money from supplying chips to these two budget Cherry Mobile MAIA gadgets However the third one the inch MAIA Smart TAB is a dualOS WindowsAndroid tablet that uses the nm Bay Trail Atom F processor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has stopped giving discounts on Bay Trail tablet processors The MAIA SMART Tab therefore might be accretive to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The obvious savings offered by a dualOS tablet product will endear it to budgetconscious buyers The pesos MAIA Smart TAB is highly likely to become another huge hit here in the Philippines The Windows Android feature of this inch Intelpowered tablet makes it great for media entertainment gaming and office productivity I dare opine that the dualOS flexibility of the MAIA SMART Tab makes it a better valueformoney purchase than the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPad Mini Unlike Apple Cherry Mobile gave it GB of RAM a microSD expansion slot USB OTG support and GB of internal flash storage This dualOS tablet product is also special because Cherry Mobile is the official partner of Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL for Android One smartphones in the Philippines Google intensely dislikes dualOS devices but Cherry Mobile still went ahead with the SMART Tab Intels close relationship with Google likely helped Cherry Mobile get away with the dualOS nature of the SMART Tab Yugatech experts already said this cheap device is qualified for a free upgrade to Windows They bought a MAIA SMART Tab and successfully upgraded it to Windows The MAIA Smart TAB is therefore the better gadget to buy than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom xpowered but Androidonly Asus ZenPad Android tablet The quadcore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU and GB of RAM will let the SMART Tab run Photoshop CC and any other Windows software Filipinoowned Cherry Mobile is often considered as the Xiaomi of the Philippines It was able to dislodge Samsung OTC SSNLF as the Philippines top vendor of phones by coming up with budgetfriendly but good quality smartphones Intels management is smart enough to partner with the countrys most successful phone vendor Samsung and Microsoft continue to snub the x Atom mobile processors anyway It will be sweet revenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to help local vendors kill the sales of sub phones of Samsung and Microsoft The Philippines is now the third largest market for smartphones in South East Asia IDC estimated that my country registered a YearoverYear growth in smartphone sales last year Out of the million that got shipped to the Philippines of it were smartphones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is smart enough to exploit the popularity of Cherry Mobiles brand The reality now is that global brands like Samsung are no longer dominant in some emerging markets MyPhone and Torque are also local smartphone companies owned by Filipinos that are stealing sales from Samsung handsets Just like in India and China Samsung lost its sales leadership to local brands Micromax and Xiaomi The partnership with Cherry Mobile is a great example of Intels willingness to collaborate with successful AsianEuropean local brands SNS Network of Malaysia also used the Atom x inside its JOI Phone and JOI LITE Android tablet Just like Cherry Mobile SNS Network first ventured with an Intelpowered in Windows tablet This eventually led to SNS Network branching out to selling Android phones with x Atom chips Another nonChinese OEM client of the Atom x is KIANO of Poland The KIANO SlimTab GR uses the Atom xC CPU It also has GB of RAM GB of ROM and runs on Android OS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is unlikely to quit the smartphone processor business anytime soon As long as there are successful local vendors that trust the x Atom for their products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will only get emboldened to produce better smartphone processors Microsoft and Samsung are making a big mistake in ignoring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom chips In the long run those two global brands will get slowly killed by agile local brands that are able to offer cheaper phones using Intelmade processors As per the example set by the sub Cherry Mobile MAIA Fone i the Atom x processor might be the key piece towards Google fulfilling its dream of selling Android One phones for emerging markets Google already failed with its first generation of MediaTekpowered Android One smartphones in India Coming up with a Android One version of the Intelpowered MAIA Fone i might be Googles saving grace I again reiterate my position that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should quit wooing the elusive Microsoft Lumia business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>instead should do its best to get inside Googles Android One global campaign We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the
