report pointed to ongoing cash flow and profitability shortfalls The companys plans for new products such as the Zen CPU appear to be too little too late AMD is in the grips of a classic death spiral in which nearterm measures only put more downward pressure on the company in the long term AMD NASDAQ AMD is exhibiting all symptoms of the classic tech company death spiral Important executives fleeing the company Products so late to market that theyre irrelevant at launch Crucial technology development getting delayed Endless restructuring as management flails away desperate to make some kind of difference Shrinking revenue and mounting losses Every quarterly report feels like a stay of execution I once had high hopes of a turnaround at AMD This was back in when the new Xbox One and PlayStation consoles featuring AMD semicustom systems on chip SOCs were announced It seemed good timing on AMDs part I was making observations that the commodity semiconductor industry was being supplanted by the custom SOCs of companies such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL Being a custom SOC house for hire seemed like a good coping strategy for AMD But the companys semicustom business just hasnt been able to take up the slack in its mainstream x CPU and graphics chip businesses All the focus on specifics of AMDs financials and products misses this crucial point The commodity semiconductor business has become a lousy business to be in The paradigm shift that Apple pioneered continues to fuel innovation in mobile devices and these devices continue to take consumer attention and money away from the classic personal computer The semiconductor business as a whole has been awash with downsizing and consolidation for some time Even the top dogs in their respective markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA havent been immune The PC market keeps shrinking and the top dogs are competing ferociously for market share to compensate Theyve largely been successful at AMDs expense Its in this context that AMDs Q earnings results should be viewed There is nothing in the report that can be rationally embraced as good or even encouraging news Revenue is down yy by to billion Whereas the yearago quarter posted a slight profit of million this quarter posted a net loss of million The emphasis in the earnings presentation on the slight sequential improvements in revenue amount to managerial legerdemain Q was bound to be higher in revenue on the strength of chip orders by the console makers This is a purely seasonal effect While Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom Group EESG where the console business resides only suffered a slight yy revenue decline for the quarter Computing and Graphics Group CCG is an absolute shambles With a yy revenue decline to million the CCG operating loss ballooned to million from the yearago loss of million AMD is hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate This quarter the cash outflow was million At this rate the company has about quarters to burn through its existing million Ten quarters of cash may seem like a long time but its really not AMD is now exhibiting one of the death spiral attributes that have become all too familiar from companies such as BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY and Nokia NYSE NOK As a result of Draconian downsizing tech companies reach a point where theres no more fat to cut Muscle tendon and bone are sliced away in the name of cost cutting but it does serious injury to the operational capability of the company Investors can see evidence of that excessive cost cutting in the delay of the oncepromising Zen processor family As of the Financial Analyst Day presentations investors were led to believe that Zen would arrive in This seemed perfectly reasonable since one of the cornerstones of Zen was expected to be its use of a nm FinFET processing node provided by either Global Foundries or TSMC NYSE TSM As of the Q earnings call Zen will merely be available in with volume production in This is an unqualified disaster but its typical of what happens when youre understaffed AMD clearly made updating its GPUs for FinFET a priority in This was a rational decision under the circumstances Nvidia will be moving to nm FinFET at TSMC The GPU area is where AMD is most competitive and it simply couldnt afford to lose more ground to Nvidia Zen is likely to suffer the fate of Carrizo The Carrizo line of SOCs was targeted at lowpower applications such as notebooks but is fabricated on TSMCs nm node That means its two full process generations behind Intels latest Skylake processor family I can only find a single review of a Carrizo laptop The review was before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake processors had arrived but based on the results and Intels claims for Skylake CPU and GPU performance improvements over Broadwell I would say that Carrizo is likely to fall well short of Skylake in both CPU and GPU performance This means that Carrizo is basically DOA AMD spoke of a few design wins for Carrizo but that doesnt necessarily translate into significant sales Zen will be more competitive with Skylake and based on AMDs claimed performance gains might even be comparable in performance This is unlikely to be enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can simply undercut AMD in clearance pricing Skylake <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>only needs to buy enough time for its nm process to begin volume production in late Other initiatives that AMD announced at the earnings call are also symptomatic of the death spiral Invariably companies in the grips of the death spiral try selling off pieces of themselves to raise much needed cash AMD has been doing this for years and the joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics is just the latest example Another example is the willingness to license or sell AMD intellectual property in the form of its patents The problem with patent licensing is the problem with most of these kinds of cash raising activities They simply reduce or eliminate the positive discriminators for the companys technology and therefore increase the longerterm downward momentum of the company When I take in the big picture the changes sweeping the semiconductor industry the incredibly tough competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia and AMDs diminishing ability to execute all I see is downside risk Granted AMD isnt dead yet nor is death imminent I cant rule out a turnaround but I dont see how the company wrenches free of the death spiral At one time I thought that Apple could be an Angel Customer for AMD by commissioning a custom SOC for the MacBook This theme has even been taken up by another SA contributor Sean Chandler It cant be ruled out and a custom Zen SOC with very enhanced graphics capability might offer an advantage over Skylake The only way I see this working is if AMD gives Apple dibs on a custom Zen SOC ahead of its general release in This depends on AMD executing smartly on the custom chip to Apples demanding specification and schedule requirements Apple would need a Zenbased SOC in for it to be useful It could still happen but based on what were seeing from AMD I dont think thats in the cards If there is such an effort underway at AMD it has the potential to become a minor fiasco reminiscent of GT Advanced Technologies At this point investing in AMD in hopes of a turnaround and rich reward may not be absolutely crazy but it skirts perilously close I consider AMD a lost cause and a sell We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to
