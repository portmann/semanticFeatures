products are evening out the playing field Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD seems to be back on track reporting a second quarter profit when a loss was expected and promising new product releases into But most investors think of AMD as the perennial loser to rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC on the CPU side and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA on the graphics side Because AMD has been Every time in the past that AMD seemed to be getting a decent share of the market one way or another its rivals knocked it back down again Shorting AMD has been a profitable hobby for some tech investors during this last decade I have owned AMD stock since so I have followed AMDs up and down cycles However after Lisa Su was promoted to CEO in I began accumulating stock again carefully She impressed me as the right person to run the company She took the product road map she inherited and the AMD team and came up with a creditable transition plan After the acquisition of ATI back in the plan had been to beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia by combining serious graphics and CPU power on a single chip dubbed an APU Advanced Processing Unit But it took longer to merge the two than expected and the resulting chips were panned as having mediocre CPUs and GPUs They were consigned to the middle range and low end of the market where margins were poor Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was ahead in process technology and so could put more gates on a chip and integrated good enough graphics on their chips Lisa Su and crew had to prioritize projects while getting the most out of a relatively small RD budget By winning the gaming console market keeping APUs alive and keeping competitive in standalone GPUs the AMD team positioned itself for a comeback in products with better margins like server chips In and we are seeing the fruits of those efforts The recent introduction of the Radeon RX graphic chip and cards appears to have gone well It probably boosted Q revenue although Q will be the first full quarter Lisa Su said there was a good supply on launch day and that the demand had continued to be strong She added some dealers have run out of supply but the nm yields are good so AMD hopes to catch up with demand and also launch the other products in the line Before the conference I had confirmed that many online retailers were sold out and were taking advance orders only The RX products are midtier Their typical buyers would be serious gamers and graphics artists with limited budgets But that is where the unit sales bulge in the market is Sure everyone wants a graphics card but given that it will be just runofthemill in years and nearly obsolete in most people budget something under for video cards In the past in every cycle I can remember AMD and its predecessor ATI and Nvidia would launch a new generation of GPUs by bringing out the top of the line first This makes sense The top of the line will beat in ability to run games or whatever the prior generations top of the line It will have high margins despite low yields of good chips from the dies When a new chip starts coming out especially after a die shrink a substantial percentage of chips have defects That can make them useless or sometimes they will qualify for the middle or bottom of the line SKUs It works psychologically too the opinion leaders get the fastest most expensive chips creating envy all the way down the price chain That is what Nvidia did this time around with their latest generation as represented by the GTX launched May and built on a nm TSMC process The costs and draws watts The RX draws watts and costs or with extra memory Is the as capable as the No But relatively few people can justify paying an extra for the increased performance We wont know how AMDs direct competition with the will compare until it is introduced but it is likely to be in the same ballpark and also sell a lot less units than the By showing the power of the new architecture Polaris GCN and process node AMD is giving midlevel users a reason to upgrade graphics cards or to look for AMD if they decide to get a higher performance card Did I mention the RX can run the new VR virtual reality goggles and games So can the Nvidia cards of course but AMD will let you do it for a more reasonable price On the CPU side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has a process technology lead over AMD but it is about to become narrower than at any time in recent history AMD CPUs at nm should be available in early <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will start moving its highend CPU products to nm but that is probably a late story So AMD has moved from being about process nodes behind to lagging the cutting edge by about half a node This should allow AMD to be more competitive for mainstream CPUs and with better profit margins Margins have been dismal at AMD for most of this decade Nvidia was pretty dismissive of AMDs sweep of major gaming consoles a couple of years back Nvidia proclaimed that gaming consoles were dying out Two trends were to minimize their sales the move to gaming on smartphones and tablets and the superiority of the PC experience for highend gaming In addition the CPUGPU chips for the consoles have relatively low margins which are not attractive to either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or Nvidia And yet gaming consoles are still selling and new models are being brought out including the Xbox One S in August Game designers who want to fill big screens with action want their games to run well on the consoles as well as PCs so increasingly game optimization tends to favor AMD In the past it tended to strongly favor Nvidia and of course the battle is far from over Game consoles have been the solid base of support for AMD allowing it to reinvent itself Sales are seasonal peaking in Q so chip shipments peak in Q That is more seasonal than the PC and graphic cards businesses so AMD tends to have dismal Qs If AMD can gain market share it is a distant second now in GPUs and do it with better profit margins the pressure will be on Nvidia Nvidia has a lot of cash and so far superior branding It lacks highend CPU technology other than ARM NASDAQ ARMH which both AMD and Nvidia license so Nvidia will likely continue to see erosion from the bottom where integrated graphics are already quite good at the same time that it hits stiffer competition for mid and highend gamer dollars However Nvidia is very strong with datacenter graphics computing and in the smart automobile industry It will not cede the gamer space without a major fight The single greatest overall problem for AMD during the last decade has been low margins Those margins reflect the lowerend categories of products that AMD chips have gone into Generally server chips have the highest margins and highend servers have higher margins than mid and lowend servers Within notebooks and desktop PCs the highend chips have the highest margins Same in GPU chips When operating margins go below zero no amount of volume sold into the lowend market will make a company profitable Without profits RD budgets suffer continuing the downward spiral Several times AMD has broken out of this spiral only eventually to be ground down by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia That could be what will happen this time But I think AMD may have finally turned the tables at least in some specific areas The population of China is about billion larger than the combined populations of the United States and Europe China has the second highest GDP in the world and the highest if adjusted for purchasing power Despite all the talk about free trade China cannot import many topend electronics products including Intels CPUs due to U S Defense Department concerns See <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>China Ban The announcement of the agreement is short enough that Ill begin by quoting it in its entirety it is within the Q results press release AMD licensed highperformance processor and SoC technology to a newlycreated JV it has formed with THATIC Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co Ltd to develop SoCs tailored to the Chinese server market that will complement AMDs own offerings The million licensing agreement is a meaningful step in AMDs IP monetization strategy intended to accelerate the Companys growth and better monetize its valuable assets Payments are contingent upon the JV achieving certain milestones AMD also expects to receive royalty payments from the JVs future product sales Our new licensing agreement is a great example of leveraging our strong IP portfolio to accelerate the adoption of our technologies more broadly said Dr Su The joint venture with THATIC provides AMD with a differentiated approach to help gain share in the fastest growing region of the server market Once the server chips are available probably in I would not be surprised if the Chinese government encourages businesses to use the Chinese chips Since AMD is providing intellectual property and does not have to make the chips the royalty payments should greatly add to AMDs margins Right now AMD has only a tiny share of the server market Between the China chip and the upcoming Zen server chip it can only gain market share How much market share it can gain will be a key question in AMD is a large global company with a variety of products I am not attempting to cover every aspect in this article just the ones that I think will have a major impact over the next years or so Well I will add just one the new professional graphics card sampling now that has a full terabyte of memory K raw video timeline scrubbing was accelerated from frames per second to a stunning frames per second As content creators rapidly adopt K resolution to futureproof their content a X performance boost will improve quality of life productivity and efficiency in the editing process That will be useful in highdefinition video editing and all sorts of highintensity computing AMDs Q upside revenue and earnings surprise is well covered for instance by AMDs Turnaround Continues so I wont go over that AMD is not out of the woods so I would still classify it as a risky investment The upside however is large Neither desktop PCs nor notebooks died as predicted Many people need their power both for entertainment and for work While some screens have shrunk some have grown in size and resolution requiring better graphics processing Gaming has become a big big industry and the end of growth is not in sight VR games will add to it and they require much more graphics processing power than even large screen games AMD has set itself up to grow with VR at price points masses of users can afford AMDs debt which seemed to loom so large just a couple of years ago now is beginning to look like a wellspent startup investment At the end of Q AMD had about billion in cash and billion in debt That is very manageable provided AMD can stay cash flow positive on an annual basis AMDs stock shot up after Q results were released and again after Q results were released last week It closed on Tuesday July at up since the close at the day before the Q results release The last time AMD was over per share was in AMDs stock still looks undervalued to me accounting both for the forwardlooking positives and for the knowledge that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia are still in command of the market I expect it will bounce around between and per share until it is either clear that AMD is really taking significant market share and at a healthy operating margin or that it has been foiled again If its the former then we will get back to multiplying EPS by whatever ratio we think is appropriate to value the stock Im thinking of AMD as a successful looking VR startup Its GPUs can run VR games Its next generation professional GPUs and server chips can generate VR content And likely in a couple of years its APUs will be able to run VR as well I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Semiconductor Broad Line </div></body></html>
