Silicon Photonics b TAM in only ondie integrated laser longest reach highest density cost advantage first to gigbit Omni Path b TAM in performance advantage lower power cost advantage Financial benefits from cloud growth include Accelerated tech adoption cloud providers compete with other cloud providers so each wants the fastest and best tech as soon as possible TAM expansion eg comms virtual network expansion from to by ASP Uplift similar to accelerated tech adoption In CAGR is from the cloud Super half of Intels cloud server revenue and CAGR for the next cloud service providers Cloud service providers are diverse and competitive Growth in cloud is worldwide from First use of nm Xeon processors NOW Half of all business cloud server expansion is for new cloud business that did not exist before cloud computing For example John Deere selling big data analytics for improving farming Honeywell for first responder data analytics BMW for connected cars airbags deploy and car notifies emergency response and reports on number of passengers location of vehicle damage to vehicle etc Most of data sent to cloud is now generated by humans Over the next few years data from machines and things will dramatically increase the data going to the cloud for storage and analytics For example video growth and D video will dramatically increase cloud computing and storage Network
