Intels Pain Is AMDs Gain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels recent launch of BroadwellE lineup will directly benefit AMD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is targeting professional gamers and game developers to boost its PC revenue Intels NASDAQ INTC client computing group revenue is undergoing a downward trend despite the chipmakers desperate effort to boost growth As a part of that continued effort <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recently introduced its BroadwellE lineup at Computex in Taipei The new processor lineup is targeted for highend desktops used in the fields of VR virtual reality and gaming The lineup consists of Intels Core processors including i X i K i K and i K Among these the i X will have cores and threads The new nm processor lineup represents a die shrink from HaswellE the previous version of Intels high end desktop platform The i X model has a price tag of Why would people pay such an exorbitant price for a processor when AMDs NASDAQ AMD Summit Ridge FX multitasking processors based on its new Zen architecture will be available in a few months at much cheaper price In todays highly graphicsintensive world its increasingly getting difficult for gaming professionals to survive without embracing megatasking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>prefers to use the term megatasking over the commonly used term multitasking for its new extreme edition CPUs Intels Gregory Bryant said If you want to do VR content like degree content stitching this part performs very well Its just a monster on enthusiast performance Its by far the fastestperforming part we have ever built While its difficult for humans to simultaneously perform multiple activities computers can do multitasking effortlessly Humans on the other hand can use their computers to achieve multitasking which in essence means doing multiple tasks either related or unrelated simultaneously on the computer Megatasking however is slightly different which allows the user to run multiple related workloads simultaneously The demand for processors supporting megatasking will rise significantly with the arrival of VR games and professional game streaming Two distinct groups of people will be benefited the most as a result of Intels megatasking CPU release viz VR game developers and professional gamersstreamers Since these users need to run sophisticated D graphics workloads on their desktops it makes sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to bring extremely sophisticated desktop chips to the market The moot question is why an enthusiast will pay the high price for Intels sophisticated chips when AMDs upcoming Zen x octacore chips are expected to be not only exceptionally powerful but cheaper as well The octacore processors in Intels BroadwellE lineup cost around AMDs current version of Piledriverbased octacore FX processor costs slightly over compared to around for Intels HaswellE octacore counterpart For the octacore processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is charging almost the same price for the BroadwellE family compared to HaswellE Although its not known yet how much AMD will charge for the upcoming FX product line AMD will certainly keep its price below Intels price in order to grab Intels market share Further AMD will replace its earlier versions of CMTbased clusterbased multithreading FX processors with Intelinspired SMT simultaneous multithreading architecture Since SMT is capable of delivering more onchip parallelism AMDs new CPUs will be more efficient for multitasking compared to earlier versions AMD is planning to introduce processors with maximum cores initially I expect that it will bring core processors to the market sometime next year However I dont expect that AMDs core processors will outcompete Intels processors with similar corecount in terms of parallelism Thats why professionals intending to run immersive D graphics workloads on desktops will prefer Intels CPUs even though the price is significantly higher than similar AMD products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Targeting ProGamers and Game Developers Can AMDs chips deliver megatasking No For workloads related to D graphics Intels HT hyperthreading technology available on its multicore ie core processors is capable of offering unmatched parallelism Although AMD is equipping its processors with SMT competing with Intels HT technology HT is Intels proprietary SMT technology will be hard for AMD Intels new Turbo Boost Max technology will make the difference which allows a CPU to identify the fastest core for directing the most critical workloads to that particular core With professional gaming platforms like Twitch becoming popular the demand for professional gamers and streamers will continue to rise This will create huge demand for chips for prosumers ie people who consume and produce media in tandem Intels i X is indeed a prosumer chip which will excel both at playingstreaming and developing games However AMD has nothing to lose but many things to win For amateur gamers and millions of people who watch live gaming online AMDs less costly chips are more than enough Dont forget that the number of people who watch live games online is far greater than professional gamers and streamers If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is for progamers and game developers AMD is for amateur gamers and online game watchers In most cases progamers and game developers pair AMDs or Nvidias NASDAQ NVDA GPUs with Intels extreme edition CPUs Given that AMDs upcoming nm FinFET Radeon GPUs based on Polaris architecture will be VRready for the masses and costeffective as well compared to Nvidias Pascalbased GPUs AMD will be able to boost its revenues significantly AMDs Roy Taylor said The reason Polaris is a big deal is because I believe we will be able to grow that TAM total addressable market significantly I dont think Nvidia is going to do anything to increase the TAM because according to everything weve seen around Pascal its a highend part Intels effort to boost its PC revenue via launching extreme edition CPUs will make AMD a direct gainer because Intels graphics endeavor will give birth to a new breed of progamers and game developers This in turn will attract more people to watch online gaming As a result demand for AMDs mass market GPUs and multitasking CPUs will rise meaningfully In a previous article I shared how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD are changing the gaming industry landscape Although Intels recent launch of extreme edition CPUs will not be able to give a massive boost to its PC revenue its encouraging that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is lately taking gamers seriously This could certainly arrest Intels PC revenue downtrend For AMD though its an excellent opportunity to turn itself around I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking
