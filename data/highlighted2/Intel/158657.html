NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>went into the gory details when it came to G at IDF Unfortunately the discussion on G flew under the radar as various other developments were given higher importance in the mainstream media Needless to say the speeds <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>anticipates from G are very disruptive G is a strategic enabler to more webconnected devices Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>isnt speaking out into an empty vacuum Theres confirmation from telecoms that theyre beginning to set the standards for G This implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already is working on G capable modems which may mean <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could close the gap between Qualcomm and start shoring up mobile losses The most important thing that came out of IDF was the keynote pertaining to G which has disruptive implications for the Internet of Things and ties very closely to whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can develop a meaningful amount of traction in the mobile space For the most part Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has been able to maintain its shipment volume due in part to its comprehensive mobile package which integrates all of the semiconductor components inside of a mobile device aside from the memory and screen Hence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC hasnt been able to transition away from its contra revenue But I do anticipate that losses pertaining to mobile will considerably decline over the next three fiscal years The low pricing on app processors explains why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>rebates below its bill of materials Its not likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will ever price its mobile chips the same way it prices its desktop and laptop counterparts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to scale the production of mobile chips otherwise there wont be any contribution to profits as the developments of mobile CPUs and baseband modems is RD intensive In Intels presentation the company believes that there will be billion devices in use by While thats a very aggressive forecast theres no denying the proliferation of various computing devices which extends the growth potential beyond conventional desktop computers Of course forecasts vary when it comes to long run semiconductor growth as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM recently mentioned on a recent quarterly earnings conference call that growth for the entire industry is expected to range between to Foundries are expected to grow slightly quicker as theyre directly linked to the growth in areas not pertaining to PCs and smartphones That being the case the performance aspect is whats really interesting here At least according to EE Times the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>panel anticipates a monumental improvement in speed The panel made it clear that their major metric was speed which they predicted would be to times faster with submillisecond latency enabling the kind of real time interactivity such as virtual worlds which today only exist in science fiction books like William Gibsons Neuromancer which virtually defined the concept of cyberspace as a world on a levelplayingfield with nature This implies that Qualcomms upcoming Gobi modems are nowhere near the speeds of G Investors can anticipate uplink and downlink speeds that are substantially better than the projected performance of Snapdragon X LTE Gobi xx series upon the introduction of G speeds This moves my timeline for when I expect G and the speed that I anticipate from G Currently the most advanced mobile modem has peak speeds of Mbps on the downlink and Mbps on the uplink If we were to apply a conservative estimate on how G would transform uplink and downlink speeds we can anticipate Gbps assuming x performance scaling At x performance scaling we can anticipate Gbps of uplink speed which will likely be the speed of later generation G modems To put Gbps in context we can compare it to the distributed denial of service attack that hit a large Chinese ecommerce company back in The server had to continually deny requests from infected computers So by wireless speeds on a mobile handset will be equivalent to the bandwidth usage of a largescale network attack from This has interesting implications for network infrastructure because there are two ways to essentially increase speeds One way is to improve the available spectrum which allows the mobile Internet to travel along more frequency bands However the other way is to increase the speed at which data moves within the available spectrum Another way of thinking about it spectrum is the available lanes on the Internet freeway whereas an improvement to uplink and downlink refers to the speed at which data travels along the Internet freeway So to accommodate for more devices accessing the Internet the implementation of G will have to take place as theres very little spare capacity on G networks currently Verizon NYSE VZ conveys that they can convert more of the available spectrum for G but its really a shortterm solution for accommodating the longterm data needs of billion projected devices Of course telecoms have to build a network to accommodate for the projected bandwidth needs of more device which is why Im very hesitant to recommend the lowertier networks because their capital spending doesnt really match the longterm data needs of mobile users Much of this increase in activity will exist at the edge of the network which will put pressure on content delivery networks to sustain lastmile connections which currently accounts for a lot of the activity that currently takes place on the web Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>isnt out on a limb making up these numbers as Verizon mentioned on its second quarter earnings call Theres a lot of things will bring efficiency to the network There is CRAN out there We are in the initial obviously G is being talked about in the industry Of course Asia is involved in G and of course we will start to get involved in the standard setting around G so theres a lot happening in this industry for technology standpoint If the mobile carriers are also getting involved with the transition to G its safe to bet that the technology is about to years out as its extremely unlikely that G will sustain the projected explosion in data usage and the current pricing model isnt very appealing to consumers and offers limited viability for growth going forward Therefore while the transition to G is capex intensive it also will increase the size of the revenue pool for both telecoms and semiconductors as G is a strategic enabler to selling more webconnected devices which also translates into more billable data for all the network providers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is starting to recover on the back of a strengthening market sentiment and the positive announcements from IDF The media went into various technologies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>showcased at the event but what was most important was the discussion of G and the upcoming architecture for its CPUfamily That being the case those two areas are in solid condition as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is positioning itself to build better mobile baseband technologies and benchmarks for Skylake were very promising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also communicated that they have more of a fiveyear to year roadmap for mobile Thats plenty of time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to catch up to Qualcomm which is why investors have a lot of growth potential over the long haul despite the maturity of the PCbusiness I continue to reiterate my hold recommendation and price target I anticipate the stock to move meaningfully following the investor
