More Than ARMs Length From Apple ARM Holdings plc NASDAQARMH Seeking Alpha Anandtech has finally compared the Apple AX with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core M using SPEC suite Anandtech compares AX with a MacBook powered by a Core M y but that laptop is one of the worst examples of Core M potential Comparison with the still old Y used in Asus Transformer T shows an average advantage of for the old Core M similar TDP While it would be suitable to see a comparison with the latest m Y <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has a great advantage for the desktop and workstation environment The website AnandTech has always been meticulous in its reviews For example it has always used reliable benchmark suites SPECInt and SPECInt which are a better performance index compared to Geekbench to compare ARM NASDAQ ARMH to x architecture mostly for desktopworkstationserver workloads Now that the iPad Pro has been released AnandTech did the comparison between the ARM Apple NASDAQ AAPL AX and some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Core M SoCs What comes from this comparison is very interesting but we must pay attention to how the comparison is made With a fine analysis it becomes clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still provides a consistent performancewatt ratio which is good for keeping actual server and desktop market share If you take a look at the above table you can see that AX is faster in certain benchmarks slower in one benchmark and much slower in the other four On average it performs against the Core M Y that powers the MacBook early AnandTech states that AX has a TDP that is entirely comparable to the Core M series thus the comparison is somehow correct from the power consumption point of view From this comparison we can say ARM is already there in some cases or that it is even more convenient while in other fields it has to work hard Obviously once the comparison switches from the Core M y old generation to the other Core M m y and y the situation is consistently more favorable to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The point is that from such a comparison it looks like ARM and Apple have reduced the gap and it is now a possible and affordable solution even for ultra lowpower laptops and servers in the near future However my advice is that there are some flaws in this review flaws that affect the comparison and the performance analysis First of all if we are talking about architectural performance taking an old lowend Core M as a reference cannot provide the right level or potential that Core M is actually capable of In addition the old series had the same price for every SoC At the same time it is difficult to find Core M devices with a fine and correct passive heat dissipation system Apple MacBook Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Surface Pro and Asus T are rare examples of what is a wellengineered device thermal profile Apple is a master when we consider this aspect Generally when a faster device is set as the reference its advantage in those benchmarks where it is really strong is somewhat reduced The percentage disadvantage of the slowest device does not linearly grow with the score difference between the devices therefore the comparison becomes less clear and the differences become less evident For example if the faster device is over the slower one the slower device is over the faster one But things get consistently different already when the faster device is over the slower one but the slower device is over the faster one If the difference is higher the discrepancy gets a lot higher too Here you can see the AnandTech comparison table with AX set as the reference It comes out that the Core M Y performs better on average because it is a lot faster where it wins while the AX wins are not so relevant in comparison The worst benchmark is the gobmk where Core M Y is slower or AX is faster but there are four benchmarks where Core M is completely devastating In particular the libquantum benchmark tells us ARM architecture still has a lot of issues for with regards to vectorizing capacities It is correct when AnandTech states in this specific comparison that the ARM architecture is already good in some aspects but the overall picture tells us that the slowest Core M is consistently faster on average An advantage of is more than the difference we can see between top AMD NASDAQ AMD and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>APUsSoCs and we know how it is the actual market balance In any case the previous point is somewhat a mathematical exercise But if we advance and also consider the new m Y or the old but fast Core M Y <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generates outstanding performance the m Y performs better and it is the Core M Y successor while the Core M Y W TDP wins every benchmark performing better In my opinion the AX must be compared to the top <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoCs because the top Core M SoCs are the highest potential attainable by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at the moment as it is AX for Apple In addition m or m or m is practically the same piece of silicon Therefore ARM still has a lot of work to do The pure performance and performancewatt comparison is still consistently in Intels favor moreover if we consider the top SoCs And it must be remembered that the Core M series is on the market only from the end of which means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still a newbie in this TDP range In the comparison there is still no m Y Looking at its better efficiency and the overall improvement from Broadwell to Skylake in SPEC the m Y will likely provide more performance than the Core M Y reaching a over the AX Obviously if there is no game between Y and AX the new top Core M will be even better it is granted Obviously it is not only a matter of performance but of price per unit the Core M is very expensive while the A and AX cost around but we are not accounting for RD employers and so on it is only the price paid to TSMC NYSE TSM From this aspect there is no match for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants very high margins and it decides different prices over the same silicon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt sell M of Core M SoCs or more therefore the scalability is not big here and it has to spread the various fixed and relative costs over a relatively small volume There are specifics features for the desktop environment not useful at that low TDP The in market is rich and is growing Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has no relevant competitors in this segment it is able to push hard on prices Therefore if Apple is thinking about using the AX or something similar for its MacBook lineup and potentially other laptops <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could decide to lower its prices to maintain Apple as its customer for a longer time But the focal point is another one Apple has been always keen to improve its devices from the performancewatt aspect providing very fast and performing machines using top performing components Switching from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x to ARM for the desktop environment would bring a lot of issues The need of a bridge from x to ARM No Windows x compatibility which has been an extremely important factor for OSX expansion since the NYSE IBM IBMIntel switch But most of all it would have a notably slower SoC Top Core M and AX are on two completely different performancewatt classes at the moment The last point is very important Apple spends a lot advertising its hardware which is always at the top at each release Apple ARM SoCs have been the fastest in CPU single core at least for Geekbench and from the GPU side at least for GFXBench The MacBook Pro was the first to introduce the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Iris GPU The MacBook Pro has been the first quadcore laptop to adopt the Iris Pro graphics and it is the only laptop able to mix good graphic performance a quadcore CPU a great display fine craftsmanship and long reviewed battery life DELL has just arrived with its XPS but it still does not provide comparable battery life The MacBook is one of the best examples of how building an efficient small laptop around the Core M series the Y inside the top tier MacBook is very fast The iMacs are always the fastest allinone on the market with very high craftsmanship For what concerns the ARM architecture things may be even different from previous forecasts since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft MSFT look to be quite serious about highend x smartphones You can read a summary here It is clear that if Microsoft is going for an highend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chip it means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is running fast and closing the gap even at very low TDPs Maybe not the best moment for an ARM switch It is true that Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM signed an agreement in China for less than M but it is a province agreement which is believed to be driven substantially by personal influence in Qualcomm It would be nice to see something consistent at national level Anyway the various ARM licensed server chip builders are still struggling at the moment They are generally behind schedule they have underperformed their past promises without attacking Intels dominion AMD has just released its Opteron A series but it is an old project which has arrived very late and it has to face Xeon D Atom Avaton not anymore The comparison is simply nonsense since Xeon D provides a performancewatt and priceperformance advantage that outclasses the new Opteron series and it outclasses even the old Xeon series take a look here the performance per watt ratio with recent Xeon D increases over which is astonishing AMD hopes are obviously posed in K which must enter the market within the end of but K CaviarThunder Qualcomm Kryo and Broadcom Vulkan will have to face not only the entire Xeon D line up which is growing and covering a lot of market sectors but also the next generation powered by the Skylake architecture we know that the Skylake architecture brings a very good boost for low power consumption per each core therefore ARM life will not be easy at all even at the microserver level AX is still no match for top Core M y and the comparison with the Skylake top Core M will be more devastating with the same TDP Surely Apple AX is a very fantastic ARM SoC and it testifies that the ARM architecture is very good but the performancewatt difference is so large that the price difference becomes not relevant in a lot of markets Apple has to provide top performing devices and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will provide a consistent performancewatt advantage over ARM Apple will continue to adopt the Santa Clara products for its desktop environment If we also consider that Microsoft may ditch ARMQualcomm for its Surface Phone and highend phones in order to adopt some upcoming highend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products in the near future it is probably not the best moment to make such an adventurous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>xARM switch for the MacBook lineups We must also consider that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working hard on winning some chip production from Apple maybe A and relative modem and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm is significantly denser than the nm from Samsung OTCSSNLF and TSMC Lastly given the Xeon D performancewatt ratio the enterprise sector will be solidly confined to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>systems in the short and mid future preserving one of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>core business For what concerns the consumer PC business the market is expected to start a real recover in H in relation to new upcoming Nvidia and AMD graphic cards At the same time Windows adoption is set to proceed steady in the enterprise market given that companies have already taken their time to testdevelop under Windows not to mention the upcoming Redstone update that improves a lot of productivity features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still a solid choice for Apple desktop devices it will be hard for ARM to attack this kind of market For what concerns this aspect ARM will likely earn nothing from this point of view Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position
