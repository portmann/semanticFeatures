<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Could Really Sell Million Smartphone Processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha The overheating issue makes the Qualcomm Snapdragon a bad move for Asus Zenfone The new Lenovo K Android phone boasts GB of RAM and a quadcore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom SoC I argued before that Asus could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC sell million smartphone application processors this year However my friend Ashraf Eassa said my estimate is more viable in Ashraf argued that Asus will allegedly also use Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and MediaTek processors for lowercost ZenFone Android smartphones However Filipino blogger Yugatechs interview with Asus CEO Jerry Shen revealed that Asus is only considering future use of the midrange Snapdragon SoC for select versions of the ZenFone Qualcommpowered Zenfones might not even come this year I think Mr Shen is probably waiting for Qualcomm to fix the overheating problem of the Snapdragon Samsung and OnePlus rejected the Snapdragon because of the overheating issue The Snapdragon is the cheaper version of the People who bought smartphones that used the Snapdragon also complained about the very high temperature from their phones The vehement reactions of readers on GSM Arena confirm my belief that using the octacore Snapdragon could damage the popular brand of the Asus ZenFone The ZenFone and ZenFone became very popular in the Philippines because of their unique Intelpowered advantage Unlike Mediatek or Qualcommpowered lowcost Android phones the ZenFone products could be used for long hours of gaming The problem with the first batch of bit Snapdragon processors that Qualcomm released last year is that it is a miserable overheating experience for HTC Desire users The extremely hot painful assessment after less than minutes of playing D games on HTC Desire also applies to the Micromax Yu Yureka The Yu Yureka also uses the octacore Snapdragon Gamers are unlikely to buy a Snapdragon powered ZenFone if it causes a painful experience Putting octacore processors inside fanless zero airvents smartphones is a disaster for hardcore mobile gamers The reason why I like gaming on the Intelpowered Asus FonePad and Asus ZenFone Lite is that they never get hot even after hours of playing the consolequality Marvel Contest of Champions The FonePad and ZenFone Lite are both powered by dualcore x Atom processors It is why they do not overheat dualcore does not generate heat as much as octacore SoCs I believe that Apple also continues to use dualcore A processors because of the same reason My old iPhone is a gaming machine that can do hour heavyD gaming marathon without any overheating fatigue Graphic designers know that dualcore workstations that has lots of RAM are best for long hours of HD video editing Quadcore and octacore processorequipped computers get hot quickly unless they are equipped with liquidcooling solutions The same principle applies to smartphones putting octacore power in fanless devices is a temperatureraising problem Sadly there is no liquidcooling solution to octacore mobile processors so Qualcomm is unlikely to solve the overheating issue of the Snapdragon The new quadcore Atompowered Zenfone offers outstanding gaming performance and theres no complaint of overheating after minutes Jerry Shen might risk alienating mobile gamers if Asus starts using the Snapdragon My dualcore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atomequipped Asus Fonepad has gorgeous consolequality graphics and smooth performance even after two hours of playing GPUCPUheavy games I firmly believe that Jerry Shen will continue to favor Atom processors because even older Atom Zpowered phablets like the FonePad can play very advanced consolequality D games like Plunder Pirates without overheating Using octacore processors is just for showoff benchmark scores that do not really translate to real life usage Lenovo the worlds top vendor of PCs and thirdbiggest vendor of smartphones has also decided to use the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom for its new quadcore GB RAMequipped midrange smartphone the K The Lenovo K which is very similar to the Asus ZenFone in terms of hardware specs is another testament of Intels better bit SoC implementation Lenovo apparently did not ignore the overheating issue of the Snapdragon Even if Asus use Qualcomm SoCs for some of its Zenfone models I still believe that Lenovos support is enough to make my million estimate reasonable Study the chart below Lenovo is a top vendor of smartphones that has more brand recognition and distribution channels than Asus now has While Asus only aims to sell million Zenfones this year Lenovo already proved it can move million or more smartphones every year The chart below is a simple explanation why I believe Lenovos support is now a bigger tailwind for Intels smartphone campaign Krzanich has the charm to win the support of the leaders of the worlds biggest phone vendors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has also proven that its bit Atom processorsequipped smartphones are not prone to overheating issues when people use them for heavy D gaming Asus is therefore likely to continue using Atom processors for its smartphones and tablets Lenovo and Asus are two very strong OEMs that made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the king of x PC processors These two giant allies will also help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>smite the mighty presence of Qualcomm SoCs in Android devices Unlike Ashrafs speculation that Rockchipmade Genabled Atom X processors will only be accretive in I firmly believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now already working fast but quietly to deliver lots of its Cherry Trail Atom SoCs to Chinese OEMs INTC therefore remains a Buy Smart buyers like mobile gamers will not buy Mediatek or Snapdragonpowered smartphones that uses processors with overheating issues Wordofmouth and YouTube complaints over overheating definitely affects the decision of millions of wouldbe buyers Source Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Could Really
