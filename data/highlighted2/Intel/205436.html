Seeking Alpha Apple upgraded its inch iMacs with Intels new Skylake processors Going forward Apple might discard Intels processors from some of its Mac models Apple NASDAQ AAPL recently upgraded its inch iMacs with Intels NASDAQ INTC new Skylake processors Although this is good news for Intels PC business its widely expected that Apple will eventually cut its relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and migrate to custom ARM NASDAQ ARMH based chips for its Macs In Q revenue from Intels Client Computing Group witnessed a yearoveryear decline to billion driven by declining PC and tablet sales Amid such a scenario the launch of Skylake could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stabilize its Client Computing Group revenue However if in the long run Apple migrates from Intels xbased processors to ARM for Macs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might not face any significant problem I believe a new economics is developing between the two companies The only reason Apple might consider moving away from Intels xbased architecture is costeffectiveness Currently Apples OS X operating system compilation is based on Intels x architecture Earlier the iMacmaker migrated from PowerPC to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>not due to cost advantages Rather it was forced to do so as PowerPC chipmakers IBM NYSE IBM and Freescale formerly Motorola departed from the PC market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>charges Apple a hefty sum of money for allowing the latter use of its advanced processors that are difficult to copy However if Apple uses SoCs it designs itself it would be able to offer customers Macs at a lower price which would eventually lead to increased market share KGI Securities MingChi Kuo believes that within the next years Apples inhouse design team would be able to come out with SoCs that are at par with Intels powerefficient Atom chips Rumors are also doing the rounds that Apple has already developed an ARMequivalent version of OS X However the fact is Apple can never exclude <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>from its entire Mac lineup If in the highend Macs such as Mac Pro and MacBook Pro that are largely used in the creative market segment Apple incorporates low power ARMbased chips it will definitely lose its loyal userbase in that particular segment So Apple cant afford to do that However a partial shift to ARM for the Macs is always possible and I expect Apple to exactly do that If for lowend Macs Apple uses ARMbased chips going forward I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should worry Why Because at the end of the day both Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>need sales and profit growth amid a fiercely competitive environment and the AppTel Ive borrowed the idea from WinTel combination thats gradually unfolding will be a winwin situation for both the companies My readers know from my past articles that I am a believer of a marketing strategy known as product differentiation which in essence means that if more options are offered to customers for a product market share of a large corporation will remain protected with diverse needs of customers being met I expect Apple to offer both ARM and Intelbased Macs the former at the lowend category and the latter at the highend category I also believe Apple will launch an ARMcompatible version of OS X for the Macs running on ARMbased SoCs Now lets focus on what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would get in exchange I deliberately used the phrase in exchange because by allowing Apple to reduce its Mac market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will certainly ask for something that would more than offset the loss The story gets interesting here The iPhonemaker recently created controversy for launching its iPhone s and s Plus models with A SoCs sourced from both Samsung OTCSSNLF and Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE TSM resulting in a minor difference in battery life Samsung made the chips using nm process while TSMC made them using nm process TSMCs version being about larger with same technology inside might result in slightly improved performance due to low heat generation Cowen Co analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote We believe that Apple had planned to use Samsung for the initial wave of A builds but also developed the Taiwan solution as insurance against yield and allocation issues Apple is not feeling comfortable with Samsung anymore due to their smartphone rivalry With Samsung possibly not in the race of developing A SoCs for iPhones iPhone and Plus and nextgeneration iPads Intels nm process technology could fill the gap Arcuri believes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>desperately wants the Apple foundry business This could be a window This new development if it really takes concrete shape in the foreseeable future could be a huge positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and for the AppTel alliance as well I believe the development will certainly take shape The basis for my belief is that sources with knowledge of Apples plans revealed earlier this tear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will make LTE chips for the iPhones instead of Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Apple and Qualcomm have an uneasy relationship according to the sources I believe Apple is reviving its relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for taking advantage of Intels formidable processor pipeline and its custom processor business Everybody will believe that if Apple maintains a warm relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>it will benefit from Intels huge investment in processor engineering We only use your contact details to reply to your request
