wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Apple should take advantage of recent declines in interest rates Bond investors are looking for investment grade or better quality Buy back shares before dividend payment and potential raise While there was a lot of panic regarding Apples NASDAQ AAPL latest quarterly results I encouraged investors to relax a bit While this might not be the best year for the iPhone all companies would love to have the quarterly results that Tim Cook and Co just detailed Management has stated it will issue more debt this year mostly to fund Apples capital return plan primarily to avoid repatriating foreign funds and paying taxes In this article I detail a number of reasons why now is the best time for Apple to issue new debt With global market worries causing investors to sell stocks a bit in fixed income has seen some decent inflows On Friday the bank of Japan decided to adopt negative interest rates sending US yields further lower The chart below shows how the year US Treasury yield is at its lowest point in a number of months Back in May Apple issued billion worth of dollar denominated debt half of which was through and year maturities Then the year US Treasury rate was around and now we are well below that With many investors expecting anywhere from one to three more US Fed rate hikes this year one might think Apple should issue debt before interest rates rise again The debt market has become a bit fractured in recent months primarily thanks to the fall in oil prices Many investors are fleeing high yield debt so those interested in corporate debt are likely headed towards investment grade issues If you are looking for high quality corporate debt dont you think a company that just reported a record billion quarterly profit would be safe Apple ended its fiscal quarter with over billion in cash albeit most of it outside the US against just billion of debt With the company generating tens of billions in cash flow each quarter I dont think Apple will have any problems paying back debt in the next decade A flight to high quality debt might attract more investors allowing Apples rate to come in lower than some might expect My main premise today is that Apple issue debt to fund its buyback plan Well with a quarterly dividend record date coming real soon buying back those shares now would save on dividend payments Many investors are expecting a dividend raise at the companys April earnings report another reason to buy shares now Additionally Apple might be at an interesting debtdividend point one that I recently discussed with chip giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC When Apple took out that debt in May it paid a annual coupon for its year bond issuance Given the items Ive discussed above Apple could be in a position to currently get year debt for or less If we take Apples roughly tax rate the aftertax cost of that debt would be As of Fridays close Apples annual dividend yield was but it was higher earlier in the week when shares were lower So while the numbers will depend on the actual interest rate tax rate and share repurchase price Apple is in a position where it could buy back shares whose dividend yield is higher than the companys aftertax cost of debt Theres a cash flow savings realized there in addition to helping boost earnings per share Do you remember what happened just about this time two years ago Apples shares fell after the Q earnings report and management stepped in with a large repurchase of shares That put a bottom in Apples shares for the near term eventually starting the next breakout seen in the chart below With shares near their week lows and analysts rushing to slash their estimates now would be a good time to put another floor in the stock I wondered in my earnings article if Apple sandbagged guidance a little to set up a beat down the road providing a good time to buy back shares If management really believes the iPhone will result in a super upgrade cycle now is the time to buy shares before they reach triple digits once again Apples management has indicated it will explore the debt markets again this year but I dont think they should wait too long With interest rates on the decline and investors fleeing high yield I believe Apple can lock in some decent rates This would allow the company to buy back a larger amount of stock especially before the next dividend payment and the potential April raise Plus management could tell the street it thinks shares are undervalued and due for a rally It worked two years ago so why not
