Takeaways From Intels Earnings Call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha The PC market will remain a challenge going forward Growth in the data center group IoT and NAND segments will offset revenue declines in the PC group on the backdrop of softer demand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC released its Q earnings on Tuesday eliciting some positive reactions from the market This was despite the fact that it had earlier on issued a statement warning of an impending drop in first quarter revenue on the backdrop of weak PC sales Shares rose about in afterhours trading to after being on a decline since the beginning of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reported a income rise to billion compared to the year ago quarter while revenue came in flat at billion These earnings came as no surprise since they just about fell even with what most analysts had predicted As mentioned earlier the weakness in PC sales was squarely to blame on the lack of revenue growth as other segments such as retail and security exhibited solid growth Moving away from the highly covered weakening PC market both on SA and in the mainstream media below are the three key takeaways I got out of the earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been incurring contra revenue leading to a loss of around billion from its mobility segment in an attempt to grab more market share after being a late comer to the mobile race This had created a large divide among Intels shareholders with those for and against unable reach a consensus with regards to whether the strategy would bear fruit or not The good news is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich and CFO Stacy Smith reiterated their commitment of making an million improvement to the segment This will be achieved through a combination of improvement on product margins and a reduction in investment levels in the segment Smith said that the product margin improvements would be propelled by the cost structure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>got with SoFIA as well as the transition to more competitive build material costs around the architecture Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to incur contra revenue related to its mobile chips through Q of this year we should expect to see the amount trending downwards DCG will continue experiencing doubledigit growth The data center group has been on an impressive run over the past couple of quarters with the segment experiencing overall growth in Q saw the segment post a year over year growth which was mainly attributed to surging demand from cloud and web customers While it would be nave to believe that the DCG business will continue exhibiting such strong growth in the long term Krzanich is pretty confident about the next couple of years prospects The CEO believes that they can continue to grow the business at steady rate of anywhere between over the next several quarters Big data will continue playing a major role in driving this growth as more and more cloud clients realize that Intels products such as Xeon E series allow them to improve their cloud performance and broaden their range of offerings to customers This was evident in the segments increased profit margins for the quarter which surpassed analysts expectations as well as a uptick in ASP Data centre continues to pull the company along said Bill Kreher an analyst at Edward Jones and we are likely to see this trend continue right into the last half of the year No MA activities on the horizon yet Sources close to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recently revealed the chip makers intent of acquiring Altera which would be its biggest acquisition yet However the deal fell through supposedly after the parties failed to reach a consensus on a suitable price tag which left the investing community speculating on a possible next target We will unfortunately have to keep guessing as Intels management declined to comment on any potential MA activity in the near term By choosing to remain tight lipped on whether we should expect to see another acquisition attempt I am of the opinion that the probability of a new acquisition remains high Intels last acquisition was McAfee at around billion or so which would make the Altera deal highly plausible If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was indeed serious about the offer then Im pretty sure plans for looking for another suitable candidate are well underway If theres anything we have learnt from the rumors of the Altera takeover its that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont likely reveal anything acquisition related probably until the last minute All in all Intels Q results were pretty impressive considering that the computer client group revenue suffered as a result of declining demand for traditional PCs However this problem is going to be solved as the company transitions its focus from traditional PCs being the biggest revenue component to new products such as the ins and phablets Also as mentioned earlier on in the article the slated release of Windows coupled with the launch of the Skylake processors bode well for the coming quarters With the rest of the business segments namely data center internet of things and NAND maintaining traction going forward and accounting for of Q revenue Intels transformation strategy is well on track Finally the slide in share price since the beginning of the year to current levels make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>quite attractive right now as we expect higher earnings and revenue to be reported in the next quarters Source Takeaways From Intels Earnings Call Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
