companies Perhaps the most interesting is the fact that his firm Berkshire Hathaway has purchased nearly billion in Apple stock recently In general I have doubts about this investment but Berkshire has had other news that investors should likely see as major positives First and foremost the company acquired an even larger stake in IBM bringing its current ownership in the business up to over billion Add to this the fact that Buffett is open to financing a deal for Dan Gilbert to buy Yahoo and a lot of interesting things are going on for shareholders Shares of Apple NASDAQ AAPL are on the rise after Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB announced that it had initiated a stake in the enterprise currently valued at million with million shares the second major technology company after IBM NYSE IBM that Berkshire has invested in This is a big step in my opinion for Berkshire but I do not believe it is necessarily the greatest opportunity for shareholders of the enterprise in the long run Ever since the passing of Steve Jobs in Ive wondered how long Apple could keep chugging along The fact of the matter is that its not good enough to be financially sound as a technologyoriented company otherwise BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY would still be the dominant player in the space you need a strong visionary leader Operationally CEO Tim Cook is an expert in his space but even Jobs lamented at the fact that hes not a product person per se This leaves in my opinion a void in the company that has yet to be filled With superior products and services Apple is sure to generate strong cash flow in nominal terms in the years to come but a technology company without an innovative leader will eventually be surpassed by a business that is even better At this pace it appears as though Apple is headed in this direction just as major players like Dell and so many others have in the past drifting into mediocrity Examples regarding a loss of innovativeness are abound Perhaps the greatest example to look at is Kodak In the company developed the first digital cameras and it was in the greatest position of any player in this space to capitalize on it This is because in in addition to having a market share in the film space the company also controlled of camera sales making it about as close to being a monopoly as you can get This allowed the firm to be labeled as one of the most valuable brands in the world up until the s when digital cameras really began to take hold After seeing sales peak in at billion and seeing profits peak at billion in the company began its long descent because it failed to innovate due to the preconceived notion that digital cameras would always be expensive and inefficient Another example but one where a company did innovate and executed but did not execute properly was in the case of Xerox NYSE XRX Larry Tesler an employee at the firm showed his bosses some of the technologies that made up Xerox PARC but they failed to appreciate the commercial applications they had Against the will of some of those in charge of Xerox PARC the firm bought into Apple in and allowed the firm thanks to the deal they received on Apples shares to see the technology that had been developed by the firm What was introduced to Apple later allowed the firm to develop its own GUI graphical user interface Of course Xerox did use some of its own technology such as when it came out with the Xerox Star in but at a cost of the firm failed to sell a meaningful number of units The final example I will look at here is in Apple itself After Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT Computer and as he was working on growing and transforming Pixar Apple lost focus and prioritized profitability over all else According to Jobs in his authorized biography After I left it Apple didnt invent anything new The Mac hardly improved With the firm looking desperately for a way to improve operations and come back from the brink of irrelevance management bought NeXT bringing Jobs back on board After he truly took over the company again he decided to cut of the firms products including the Newton and set about reinventing the business We all know how that story has shaped up between then and now Now to understand that this is really starting to happen we need only look at unit sales of Apple products in the image below During the latest quarter the business sold million iPhones Although this is better than the million anticipated it was far below last years million units iPad sales also fared poorly dropping from million to million units while Mac sales dropped from million to million units As the market matures its expected to see growth slow and even some decline in unit count isnt always a bad thing but these yearoveryear falloffs are in my opinion material in nature Another negative in my opinion is the announcement Apple made regarding its capital return program In its press release the company stated that it intends to increase its return to shareholders by another billion to billion through raising its stock buyback program from billion to billion As part of this management stated that it will be raising Apples dividend by an extra moving forward Although research and development costs during the quarter were billion up from billion in last years second quarter I cannot fathom a business wasting good capital on dividends and buybacks when they should be investing more in their falling product lines or in revolutionary as opposed to evolutionary new concepts It should be mentioned however that not everything at Apple is bad For starters the company currently has cash and cash equivalents on hand of billion This is a nice chunk of change but when you add shortterm and longterm marketable securities to the mix you have an extra billion in capital bringing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities up to billion To put this in perspective tech giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has a market cap of billion and entertainment giant The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS has a market cap of billion This amount of capital is equal to roughly of Apples current market cap of billion What this means is that Apple is not dead but the picture doesnt look positive Management has a great deal of capital that it can allocate toward growth but it seems content with rewarding shareholders through dividends and buybacks at a time when it needs an innovative mind to take the reins at least from a product perspective if not a management one In my mind this is troubling to say the least because any absence to move in the proper direction risks allowing history to repeat itself when the dominant technology player will succumb to mediocrity While I do not particularly care for Buffetts or rather Combs or Weschlers move into Apple I do believe the company probably made a wise decision to add to its stake in IBM According to the firm it added another shares of the business recently bringing the total share count owned by Berkshire up to million This values the firms stake in the enterprise at about billion today In the past Ive dug deep into IBM and the rationale behind why the company provides investors with good prospects moving forward I do not want to inundate investors too much with my argument again because it would just be a rehash of that but I will say that what intrigues me most about IBM is the fact that its Strategic Imperatives Revenue has been rising In this set of operations accounted for of IBMs sales but today they stand at with revenue in totaling billion Of this the firms Analytics operations represent the largest portion of this category standing at billion This is followed by the billion generated under Cloud operations Thanks to some extent at least to these operations the cash flow picture at IBM has started to turn around even as sales continue to suffer In the table below you can see that the firms operating cash flow and free cash flow in came out to billion and billion respectively While these numbers are below where they were in when operating cash flow hit billion and free cash flow stood at billion the firms recent numbers demonstrate a turnaround from the results posted in So long as cash flow can continue to rise and margins can stay healthy I feel that Buffetts decision to add to the business while shares are cheap nominally speaking is a fine idea Another interesting tidbit of news that has surfaced in the past few days relates to Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and the fact that Buffett is considering backing billionaire Dan Gilbert in bidding for the enterprise Buffett did state that he would need a secured type of investment to make a deal work so we are either looking at some sort of debt arrangement a preferred stock arrangement or some combination of these with common stock thrown in as a possibility depending on the terms Yahoo has interested me for a while and there was a point at which I held shares in the business The reason for this comes down to the firms ownership of shares in Alibaba Group Holding NYSE BABA Due to a wise and some might say lucky investment many years ago the firm now owns million shares of Alibaba Without factoring in taxes these shares are worth around billion With a market cap of billion this implies a value on the rest of Yahoo of about billion Because of the possibility of Buffett receiving a secured investment in the firm and the fact that a Reverse Morris Trust transaction may be able to eliminate more than billion in deferred taxes associated with Yahoos ownership in Alibaba I like the riskreward opportunity for Berkshire here but we will need to await more information before we understand exactly what kind of impact this will have on the enterprise Until then anything more is just sheer speculation At this moment Mr Market is not very happy with Apple but Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway is In my own opinion management is sitting by and letting the firms business erode at a time when it should be focused on making the same kinds of revolutionary leaps forward that made the business the overwhelming behemoth that it is today Instead the current path is one of making iterations of many of the same products and appeasing shareholders who in their defense are not content to let cash just sit on the companys books From a product standpoint I love Apple every computer Ive owned has been an Apple one but I cannot personally invest in the business until I see some major changes take place and I doubt that will happen with the current leadership in place Outside of the Apple news I find the rest of the information regarding Berkshires moves to be refreshing The firm is entertaining a financing transaction of Yahoo which depending on the structure of any such deal will likely grant Buffett a nice chance of return and it is continuing to add to IBM a firm that I feel is very much underappreciated by Mr Market at this point in time Of course only time will tell what happens with the business but I do think investors have a lot of news to look forward to in the weeks months and years to come Disclosure Iwe have
