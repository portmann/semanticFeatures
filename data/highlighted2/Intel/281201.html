but able to do more We will apply Moores Law to grow todays FPGA business and well invent new products that make amazing experiences of the future possible experiences like autonomous driving and machine learning What Krzanich said is really significant for Intels future growth and share price Applying Moores Law to grow todays FPGA business is the next big thing in the semiconductor industry Fellow SA contributor Bruce Burnworth once commented in one of my previous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>articles that network virtualization is an area that will drive high teen growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>after when cloud growth will start to taper off This area will make huge use of FPGAs according to Mr Burnworth I completely agree with him In his recent article Burnworth opined that after Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could buyout a company in the NFV network function virtualization field However I believe collaboration with VNF virtual network functions developers is the key to succeed rather than a new acquisition Its really a complex topic In this article I will try to delve deeper into this emerging area The term network virtualization typically refers to the process of combining both hardware and softwarebased networking resources into a softwarebased entity in order to enhance the efficiency of networks In order to keep cost at a minimum level along with enhancing efficiency telecom operators and enterprises are embracing network virtualization Furthermore the implementation of VNF has been rising steadily Since VNF allows using software without depending on underlying hardware both capex and opex savings can be achieved Investors should note that NFV and VNF are different although used by networking professionals interchangeably Heres an example In a group of major telcos took an initiative to apply the technology of virtualization and cloud to the telecom domain The term NFV was coined then to represent the initiative NFV allows running SDNs softwaredefined networks independent of hardware platforms and VNF is the building block of an NFV framework Understanding the difference is important because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to integrate SDN and NFV on standard x platforms to expand the competitive advantage of the platform To learn more about the difference from an expert click here The current trend of implementing NFV predominantly depends on utilizing commodity processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is preparing its x platform to make it the default hardware platform for deploying NFV along with SDN in future If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can offer telecom operators and enterprises a processor that makes proper use of FPGAs in implementing NFV the potential of Intels x platform will rise substantially This will lead to increasing demand for Intels products based on ONP open network platform server reference design starting from processors to communications chipsets to Ethernet controllers I discussed more rigorously about Intels ONP server reference design is a previous article A research paper proposed couple of years ago that the use of FPGAs could be an ideal platform for NFV The paper also presented the opportunities for an FPGAbased NFV platform Excerpts from the paper are presented below By using FPGAs as the main hardware NFV could achieve the flexibility and the fast deployment of the softwaresolutions and the high throughput of the specialized hardware devices FPGAbased NFV can provide the flexibility of the NFV based on general purpose processors GPPs while at the same time providing the necessary throughput that the GPP cannot sustain By the term general purpose processors researchers wanted to mean commodity processors The industry is slowly but surely heading towards the FPGAbased NFV era as predicted and proposed by the researchers FPGAs make data processing faster by incorporating parallelism According to an expert An FPGA is as the name would imply a big old list of gatesAND gates NOT gates XOR gates the whole familya line of digital turnstiles stretching around the entire globe These gates are designed to do something to a piece or pieces of data and theyre able to do it all at once This is in contrast to a normal sequential computer processor which would instead iterate through that array of gates doing one operation at a time So the parallel FPGA just takes a single step through the whole line of gates while the sequential processor has to walk around the whole globe going one turnstile at a time Aside from Altera Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX also helps chipmakers offer parallelism via processors Xilinx offers SDAccel a software defined environment which can boost the performance of VNFs It also offers SDNet which supports SDN The moot question now is whats Intels competitive advantage with the Altera buyout when every chipmaker can bundle FPGAs with their chips So what is OpenStack Its an opensource community that develops cloud management technologies which RackSpace NYSE RAX and NASA jointly launched in The OpenStack Foundation was formed in OpenStack has the potential to unlock the full benefits of NFV with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at its forefront <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been elected as the first new Platinum member of the OpenStack Foundation with effect from January along with a seat on its Board OpenStack is developing rapidly and as it continues to grow it will gradually help overcome the shortcomings todays NFV environments are facing Telecom operators and enterprises desperately need a comprehensive NFV platform based on OpenStack If readers want to learn in detail how OpenStack could help NFV become mature Id recommend reading this article written by an industry insider Long story short Intels competitive advantage lies in jointly building the NFV platform mentioned above leveraging OpenStacks resources and exploiting its partnerships with OpenStack pioneers like RackSpace and VNF developers like AlcatelLucent NYSE ALU Intels ultimate aim is to dominate the NFV space by making its x platform the default choice for telcos In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and RackSpace agreed to build an OpenStack Innovation Center in San Antonio Texas Two node server clusters were provided to developers for free for testing and validating OpenStack code <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has established a partnership with AlcatelLucent also for improving the latters CloudBand NFV platform via OpenStack A PoC Proof of Concept study conducted by ETSIs European Telecommunications Standards Institute NFV Industry Specification Group examined the benefits of hardware acceleration in NFV environments In the study the engineers installed Alteras FPGA card They also programmed it using Alteras IPsec accelerator They repeated the test and concluded the following This test demonstrated exactly one of the two approaches to compute intensive functions By pairing a CPU and FPGA the heterogeneous hardware remains flexible and ready to implement any virtual network functions Obviously collaboration between the VNF developer and the FPGA vendor must exist This type of development is exactly what the ETSI NFV ISG PoCs are meant to stimulate So it seems that the mission in this case is accomplished It is noteworthy here that as the study suggests <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as an FPGA vendor is heading in the right direction by collaborating with VNF developers like AlcatelLucent In this article I tried to establish the fact that Intels collaboration with key companies will make it the dominant player in the NFV space However as I said in the beginning this is a complex subject Nonetheless NFV is a nascent area that offers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>meaningful growth opportunities Investors should continue to focus on Intels new collaborations to evaluate whether its competitive advantage remains intact Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
