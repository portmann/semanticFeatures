design The design specification will be based on IBMs NYSE IBM Power processors which will arrive in the marketplace in the second half of Mainstream media is clamoring that GOOGs move is designed to siphon away Intels NASDAQ INTC server revenue by inducing other companies to embrace Googles strategy For example Bloomberg said Google has technology to easily switch away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp server chips and is helping other companies do the same a potentially worrying development for the dominant provider of processors that power data centers Investors Shouldnt Listen To Mainstream Media Google didnt say it will influence other companies to follow what it is doing Google only said it hopes to submit the architecture design to the OCP open compute project community This should be considered merely as an academic issue because it will have limited impact on the industry given the industry is going through a significant transitional phase Why does Google need to design an open server architecture Well its initiative to develop an open server architecture is solely aimed at supporting the rising demand for compute at Google GOOG said It wont surprise anyone to hear that demand for compute at Google has been relentless and it isnt slowing down any time soon Google needs dedicated servers to support its computing demand which primarily comprises of big data and analytics workload IBM has built an enormous software portfolio based on AI artificial intelligence and Watson which could help Google grow its ad revenue Since Googles business model revolves around big data and analytics it makes perfect business sense for the company to take advantage of IBMs expertise in AI However it wont be possible for a company like Googles scale and size to take the fullest advantage of IBMs AI expertise without building its own server architecture Having a separate server architecture will allow Google to allocate resources optimally across the globe to generate maximum ad revenue While it is true that some large companies could take Googles route I dont believe GOOGs initiative will create a mass departure of companies from Intels xbased server platform Googles case is entirely different and mainstream media is misguiding Intels investors While Google needs dedicated servers for its own datacenters traditional IT infrastructure market is shifting towards cloud driven by public cloud datacenter expansion IDC forecasted For the fiveyear forecast period IDC expects that cloud IT infrastructure spending will grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of and will reach billion by accounting for of the total spending on enterprise IT infrastructure At the same time spending on noncloud IT infrastructure will decline at CAGR Spending on public cloud IT infrastructure will grow at a higher rate than spending on private cloud IT infrastructure at vs CAGR Clearly cloud servers will drive the datacenter growth in future Demand for dedicated servers will gradually decrease Sensing that computing workloads for enterprises are slowly but steadily shifting in the cloud <span

its cloud portfolio by launching faster SSDs Diane Bryant senior vice president and general manager of Intels Data Center Group said that INTC is investing to mature softwaredefined infrastructure SDI for ensuring the availability of cloudbased services to enterprises The recently introduced Xeon E v processor family which will be manufactured on nm process has more cores and cache compared to the prior generation With faster memory advanced server technology and enhanced security features the new processor line will better address the requirements of SDI than before The newly launched SSDs which are optimized for the new processor line will make the task easier Fellow SA contributor Bruce Burnworth said in an SA article Intels Xeon and SSD announcements are good news but not great news Time will tell if these are good news or great news but I expect Intels datacenter group revenue will certainly get a boost as a result of the new product launches Google has joined hands with Rackspace as mentioned in the beginning to develop its server architecture design <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also has a partnership with Rackspace as part of its Cloud for All initiative This essentially means that techgiants are using the expertise of Rackspace the leading OpenStack operator as an open source resource Googles collaboration with Rackspace isnt a threat
