Things That Will Save Intels Future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a state of flux but is its future really as bleak as investors and analysts assume Where is the company positioning itself for the future and how long will it take them to recover from the current decline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is in a state of flux Just a quick look at recent articles on SA will tell you how bearish the sentiment has become with some even going to the extent of predicting doomsday scenarios Declining PC shipments have indeed taken the wind out of Intels sales pardon the pun and the company is desperately looking for revenue streams outside of their core PCbased business But how bad is the reality of the situation How low will the chip maker go before it catches the next wave of success and where will that wave come from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is banking on their data center business and Internet of Things to get them out of trouble With the companys mobile overtures failing to make the cut <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is more dependent on these two segments than ever IoT is still in nascent stages but the market is expected to explode in the next decade Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ride that wave to success And how long will IoT take to compensate for the loss in their core segment of client computing These are the key questions I will try to answer here Before we start lets look at some numbers around their current revenue segmentation and where IoT stands in relation to that At the end of first quarter Intels Internet of Things group had million in revenues accounting for nearly of total thats million more than what the company earned at the end of first quarter in Thats growth in three years time Though the doubledigit number looks attractive its still a long way from the over growth rate the cloud industry is witnessing on a quarter over quarter basis The reason I compare it with cloud is because these two industries are inextricably intertwined in a symbiotic relationship IoT needs cloud in order to be truly accessible and cloud needs IoT in order to grow to its full potential So for now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a majority of its revenue coming from its client computing group while less than a tenth of that comes from their presence in the Internet of Things space The question now is can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>grow its IoT business as fast as its PCbased business is slowing down First things first What is the Internet of Things To put it in simple terms Internet of Things is a network of connected dataharvesting devices that can convert every measurable action into data and then collect store transmit analyze and exploit that data to identify patterns and trends to ultimately create actionable intelligence or in some cases cause actions to occur based on that intelligence As you can clearly see there are at least two parts to the IoT equation one is the data generation and movement part and the other is the data exploitation part Companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO fall squarely into the former part because their products help in the gathering assimilating and transmitting that data into subsequent parts of a typical IoT system Theres a lot of hype around how fast the Internet of Things will grow and there are even estimates that say it will be a trillion opportunity by I think and I have this on good authority from IBMs NYSE IBM General Manager for Watson Internet of Things Chris OConnor whom I interviewed earlier this week that it may even be as high as trillion But the problem is thats not revenues theyre all talking about According to Technology Business Research total IoT revenue of the top companies which include Accenture NYSE ACN Amazon Web Services NASDAQ AMZN ATT NYSE T Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Dell Ericsson NASDAQ ERIC GE NYSE GE Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL HPE NYSE HPE Huawei IBM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT OBS Oracle NYSE ORCL Salesforcecom NYSE CRM SAP NYSE SAP Siemens OTCPKSIEGY Symantec NASDAQ SYMC Telefonica NYSE TEF and Verizon NYSE VZ grew year over year in Q to reach billion Thats billion spread across companies so each one only has a small piece of the pie Intels slice is less than a tenth of that pie at billion for Q As for their growth in this segment we already know that it took them three years to go from million per quarter to million per quarter or as I mentioned earlier Thats a CAGR of in an industry that has been growing at Keep that in mind as I now show you how fast their PCbased business is declining So that to trillion figure I spoke of earlier is not the revenues that will be generated but the total volume of business that will be impacted because of the Internet of Things Now on to the PC side of Intels business How Bad Is The Downward Slope For The Client Computing Group On the surface it doesnt look too bad Like most retail products PC sales are cyclical and typically heavier during the second two quarters of the year But if you look at their TTM revenues at the end of versus table below youll see a loss of about billion Thats about a loss YoY another figure to keep in mind Investorspeak Where Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Stand and Should You Buy or Sell In summary the gap between increasing IoT and data center revenues will need time to offset the decline in their core segment Heres a summary of what we calculated above IoT revenue is growing at a rate of plus yearoveryear against an industry growth of a sign that theyre at the leading edge of the IoT phenomenon Client Computing sales is declining at nearly yearoveryear against an average industry decline PC shipments of about If you extrapolate that in a linear fashion it will take them until the year for IoT revenues to fully compensate for the chiprelated income decline From that perspective it looks like a lost cause But there are other factors that come into play and these are what we should pay special attention to because they make all the difference between a company on its way out and a company that will claw its way back up First personal computers arent going to suddenly drop dead and make way for an exclusively mobile world There are still things you cant do easily enough on a mobile device thats a breeze for PCs like writing this article and submitting it to Seeking Alpha for example I cant do this effectively on even the most expensive mobile or tablet in the world but I can do it on the cheapest PC in the world which probably runs on an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chipset The decline in shipments is not sustainable and it will eventually stabilize Second IoT growth will accelerate even faster as we approach critical mass that everyone agrees will happen around the year when estimates put public cloud revenues at around billion up from billion in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already is at the front end of that growth so theyll continue to grow faster each year That current rate of CAGR is only going to get bigger by the year as the industry itself accelerates With more than big companies in the fray and hundreds more providing various components for IoT systems thats inevitable Third their data center group also is growing at a healthy rate and will accelerate as more companies move to the cloud and the top three cloud players IBM Amazon Microsoft and Google keep expanding their data center footprints around the world Another point is that the company has made a billion investment to acquire Altera a specialist in field programming gate array FPGA technology which allows quick reconfiguration of servers for varied workloads something that is critical in a cloud data center environment And yes this segment will grow with or without Google Combine these three scenarios and this is what we have The offset between IoT growth and PC decline will happen faster over time and the aggressive growth of cloud data centers will provide additional floor support for declining revenues In my opinion it will take at least five years for us to see the net positive effect of these on Intels top line but most of the downside has already been priced in at a forward PE of My recommendation is simple you can buy now on a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP over the next two to three years but youll need to wait another two to three years to see your investment start to pay off After that five to sixyear period I expect cloud and IoT to be significant top line contributors while their core PC business gradually takes a back seat to give them a dependable albeit slowgrowing foundation The senior management team has been shaken up lately by the exits of the IoT and Client Computing heads but it seems that the board needs to shake the tree even more so the real fruitbearing branches can grow in a healthy way moving forward Thanks for reading my article To follow me and get realtime alerts
