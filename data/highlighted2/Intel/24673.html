NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Uses free cash flow analysis to try and explain why Altera thought the price offered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was too low Provides complete free cash flow data for both companies Describes why its a shame that the deal did not go through as both companies seem to be a perfect fit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reportedly ends Altera talks shares fall I found this to be very interesting so I decided to perform a free cash flow analysis on both companies and try to determine why Alteras management has supposedly rejected the offer In this analysis I will be using my free flow methodology in analyzing both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Altera NASDAQ ALTR and for those of you unfamiliar with that methodology you can read my introduction on it by going HERE The first step in our analysis requires us to analyze the free cash flow and price to free cash flow results for both companies You can clearly see why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made a pure cash offer for Altera as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generated billion in free cash flow TTM Twelve Months Trailing At the price that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was offering for each share of Altera I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was offering a fair price while not overpaying at around times Alteras price to free cash flow I would imagine that Alteras board of directors were probably looking for around times free cash flow or about a share as the company did generate almost billion in free cash flow in and may have wanted to factor that result into the price The second step in our analysis is to analyze both companies Owners Cash Profits ratio which is YCharts version of Warren Buffetts equation OwnerEarnings The owners cash profit ratios for both companies came in with a slight increase for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and slight decrease for Altera versus both companies free cash flow numbers But Alteras lower results for this ratio are not significant enough for us to change our opinion as to the per share price that we believe Alteras management would have approved the deal The free cash flow to equity ratio is a measure of how much cash can be paid to the equity shareholders of the company after all expenses reinvestment and debt repayment Since the Seeking Alpha breaking news article specifically mentioned that talks between the companies had been going on for months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must have noticed that Alteras free cash flow to equity results dropped sharply into the red in as the chart above shows and actually stayed negative for a while Only recently did Alteras free cash flow to equity result finally come back from its deficit and thus improved its managements negotiating position Now that we have the results for both companies on all three ratios that make up our free flow ratio let us now crunch the numbers using TTM data At the end of the table you will find each FRROIC result where FRROIC Free Flow Return on Invested Capital FFROIC simply tells us how much free flow is generated for every one dollar of invested capital that each company employs So as you can see Alteras FFROIC would have complemented Intels very nicely Its a shame that the companies decided to call off negotiations as both are high quality well managed firms with a long history of outperformance and leadership in the industry in which they operate and in my opinion Altera would have been a perfect fit for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Source <span style='background-color:
