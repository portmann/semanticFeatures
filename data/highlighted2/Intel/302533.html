receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Apple achieved record iPhone sales and total revenue in the December quarter However Apple guided to a yy revenue decline for the March quarter This will embolden Apple bears and their view of Peak iPhone Apples fiscal Q earnings report provided material that both bears and bulls can use to support their respective cases While I remain bullish in the long term Apple NASDAQ AAPL guided for a yy revenue decline for the March quarter and conceded that iPhone sales also will decline Bulls will have to look beyond this to the iPhone as well as the Watch which is gaining sales traction Apples growth prospects are good but they depend on Apples ability to innovate in new product areas such as automobiles and virtual reality Apple provided some reassurance for investors by exceeding the total revenue and iPhone units sales for the December quarter In the table below I summarize Apples results and provide error calculations for comparison with my predictions In the conference call on Tuesday CEO Tim Cook pointed out that the revenue growth would have been about yy in constant currency According to Apple macro conditions including economic slowdowns in key markets as well as foreign exchange headwinds played major roles in Apples results Under the circumstances beating last years performance is a huge accomplishment although Apple didnt beat it by quite as much as I would have liked Since this was widely expected bearish sentiment has become muted in the past few weeks compared to what it was at mid year Back in May Michael Blair had the dubious honor of making the Mac Observer Apple Death Knell Counter with his article Apple Zenith Behind Us Nadir On The Horizon In the article he states A few million units of Apple Watch or a few billion of consumer purchases through Apple Pay will not come close to filling the gap if iPhone volumes drop or million units annually and that is what I expect to take place in the coming quarters Since that time Apple has reported three quarters of financial results and iPhone sales volumes havent come anywhere close to Blairs prediction Even as recently as December Blair was predicting a disappointing Q with million in iPhone sales and total revenue of just million Clearly Apple bears need to readjust their expectations but I concede that the guidance for fiscal Q will serve to embolden them once again Apples revenue guidance of billion represents a yy decline of from fiscal s billion This will certainly afford bears a renewed opportunity to declare Peak iPhone As I pointed out in my preview article this theme was not going to go away in any case In my preview article I had thought that Apples Q earnings report would settle the issue of whether the supply chain rumors could serve as reliable indicators of future sales Unfortunately I dont think the earnings report really did that Lets go back to Katy Hubertys of Morgan Stanley supply chain data that was reported back in December which kicked off the Peak iPhone theme At the time the data indicated supplier cutbacks of for the December quarter and for the March quarter with the obvious implications for iPhone sales for the respective quarters But we know there was no decline in iPhone sales for the December quarter and that the expected decline in iPhone sales in fiscal Q will be less than according to Tim Cook during the conference call Cooks assessment of the iPhone sales decline was given in answer to a question by Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi So at least in terms of making quantitative predictions the supply chain data doesnt appear to be very useful The lack of quantitative accuracy really calls into question the predictive value of supply chain data At most the supply chain data may be an indicator of a gross trend Or it may be that analysts simply resorted to supply chain rumors to bolster a case for the Q revenue decline that could be deduced from other sources In fiscal Q Apple acknowledges that it was still meeting pent up iPhone demand from Q On that basis as well as macro economic factors there was a plausible case to be made for a yy decline in iPhone sales My personal take on the issue of supply chain data is that the best data comes from major suppliers such as Foxconn and TSMC NYSE TSM which publish monthly sales figures In my recent article on TSMCs earnings I expressed concern about the downturns that both Foxconn and TSMC were seeing toward the end of the December quarter in the form of monthly sales revenue In retrospect I should have weighted this data more heavily in my expectations for Apples fiscal Q guidance There were bright spots besides iPhone and Mac sales for the quarter specifically in Services and Other Products categories I was very glad to see Apple provide supplementary information on Services I get so tired of hearing that Apple is just a hardware company Apple announced that it has an installed base of billion active devices for all its various OS platforms iOS Mac OS X tvOS and watchOS Apple pointed out that this installed base accounted for of its services revenue in fiscal of billion In fiscal Q Apples Services revenue grew by yy to billion excluding the Samsung patent infringement settlement But the direct Services revenue ignores the larger services picture for Apples products Every operating system and device Apple makes incorporates a host of free services that Apple users take for granted These include iCloud drive iMessage Facetime and automatic tracking of App Store and iTunes content purchases Apple monetizes these services through the premium prices of its hardware Every Apple product basically amounts to OSaaS Operating System as a Service The Other Products category exceeded my model estimate of billion at billion in revenue for the quarter I believe this indicates that my prediction of about million in Watch sales was just about right Apple TV is also in this category so Apple TV sales probably contributed to the surplus The iPad Problem is Really a Mac Problem Of all the information in the earnings report the most concerning is iPad sales which once again came in well below my expectations Apple clearly needs to do more to address the sales decline than it has Although Im personally very impressed with the iPad Pro it was not enough to even slow down the sales decline As I explained in my recent article on the impact of the Pro I think I get where Apple is going with iPad Eventually Apple wants to evolve iOS into the principal computing platform that people use rather than PCs The trouble is that evolution isnt moving fast enough In the meantime Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has jumped out in front with Windows tablets and in convertibles such as its own Surface Pro and Surface Book As general purpose tablets and productivity tools they offer much more compelling value propositions than iPad Pro For the cost of the iPad Pro a consumer can buy a tablet that runs the full version of Windows uses a more powerful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processor and runs a host of legacy Windows software Apples intransigence about not endowing Mac OS X with touch screen capability has gone beyond merely annoying Its a very real threat to the Mac franchise itself Yes I know that the Mac continues to outperform the traditional PC market according to recent data by IDC and Gartner The problem is that IDC and Gartner have chosen to exclude Windows tablets from their PC market data When either of the two companies get around to publishing market data for tablets I believe well find that Windows tablets and ins are beating up on iPad pretty badly The irony of this is that Im convinced as an iOS developer that endowing Mac OS X with touch would be relatively straightforward Apple has already introduced numerous features and UI conventions from iOS into Mac OS X in recent years including full and split screen capability and an app launcher Most importantly Mac OS X with touch would be a far better and more consistent user experience than Windows could ever hope to be Im certain of that because I use Win every day Once again as with the small screen iPhone investors are treated to the spectacle of Apple wrapped around the axle of its not invented here attitude Apple needs to get over this once and for all Touch is becoming ubiquitous and lack of touch is becoming a crippling deficiency for Mac OS X The problem for Apple investors right now is that theres really no way to disprove the Peak iPhonePeak Apple narrative Even though most analysts are maintaining fairly bullish takes on Apple following the earnings report buy and overweight ratings are being accompanied by lower price targets Certainly Apples take is that theyre just up against a lot of macro head winds that are affecting the industry as a whole Its reasonable to be skeptical about this and Ill certainly be looking hard at earnings from competitors such as Microsoft for confirmation or the lack for these supposed headwinds Even if macro headwinds can explain the March quarter guidance I doubt that things get better for the June quarter in terms of iPhone sales The June quarter will see a brace of new phones from Samsung OTCSSNLF as well as new phones based on Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM very impressive Snapdragon processor The intensification of competition in the June quarter will not help iPhone sales in the least So for the next couple of quarters the bearish take on iPhone and therefore Apple is going to be very difficult to dispute The short term next couple of quarters could offer significant pain for Apple investors Ive always taken the longterm view of Apple Apple is dependent on its ability to innovate new products That doesnt bother me as much as it does some investors who prefer predictable revenue increases Apple is investing increasingly in RD as I have long advocated I expect that RD will continue to yield innovative compelling products Given the shortterm outlook my recommendations for Apple have to be very qualified Yes I think its still a buy but only for those with a very long multiyear investment time frame In the near term it doesnt look good as a buy if only because better buying opportunities will come later in the year As to what Im going to do Im basically doing what I said I would do in my Positions for article Im holding Apple and looking for opportunities to diversify Im confident Apple will recover but I wouldnt want to predict when that will occur </div></body></html>
