Multiple Catalysts Will Drive A Double In And Another Double In Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha The long downhill march of AMDs stock price is about to change direction New money new contracts and Zens release will drive price higher Zens desktop production will make AMDs first profitable year since I have written articles about AMD NASDAQ AMD since March and everyone has been about their longterm potential to hit The first on March was titled Reasons Why AMD Will Be By and the last one published on Dec was More Reasons Why AMD Will Be In To say it has been a bumpy ride over the last months would be to put it mildly Executives have changed cash has shrunk sales have dropped along with margins and market share keeps dropping So what is the good news Executives have changed for the better million is on the way sales and margins have nowhere to go but up and market share in graphics has inched up with desktop and server to follow when Zen is in production Others must agree with me because the price has risen over since Dec from to on Dec In this my th article on AMD I will provide a rough timeline defining how I see the price going to QQ Joint Venture JV deal with Nantong Fujitsu NFME is completed and AMD receives M in cash thereby assuring future development of Zen In October AMD announced an agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics for the sale of of its SATS Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services facilities for net cash of about million See AMD Cash Infusion Means It Is Time To Buy This Beleaguered Laggard for more on the subject Q The Radeon AMDs first NM FinFet GPU Arctic Islands is released for production starting in the nd or rd quarter We are also focused on delivering our nextgeneration GPUs in designed to improve performance per watt by X compared to our current offerings based on design architectural enhancements as well as advanced FinFET process technology Q through Q OPEX and CAPEX savings will improve cash flow by at least M per year The ATMP Assembly Test Mark and Pack facilities are capital intensive so CAPEX relative to the ATMP facilities should be decreased According to CFO Kumar CAPEX should be down a total M in per transcript Also the transferring of employees about of AMD employees to Natong will decrease operating costs significantly CFO Kumar mentions M in OPEX savings not including JV savings which are yet to be determined So total savings on CAPEX and OPEX including the new JV will certainly be well over M in The agreement also calls for no overall cost increase for AMDs use of the JVs ATMP services While still a rumor it appears increasingly likely that Nintendo with console sales of over million units will be contracting with AMD to produce a new semicustom SoC System on a Chip for their new consolecontroller I am not sure how much sales will be generated by these AMD ARM chips but since AMDs current market share of the server market is about anything would be a plus Also amortizing the sunk cost of all the RD that went into ARM development would be another plus Here is a good explanation of how the new servers will be used The big Kahuna in AMDs stock price increase is the successful release of their new x chip Zen The release is scheduled for th quarter CPU with the APU CPUGPU sometime after that in The longtime performance gap between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and AMD is going to shrink considerably and this will result in improved sales to OEMs who have been waiting for AMD to produce a competitive product to offset Intels price monopoly As of now AMD competes only at the low end of desktop and laptop chips but with Zen I think they compete for at least mid to high end of that market instead of the current low end only Combining Zen with HBM and new GPUs could create a monster APU in called Exascale Heterogeneous Processor or EHP This would be a highpriced highmargin product No one makes much margin selling to Apple but the PR would be outstanding if Apple decided to switch x vendors One advantage AMD has is it could design a semicustom x SoC to Apples exact specs as opposed to Apple buying the stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ICore products Apple uses AMD graphics cards now in its highend Macs Finally in AMD will once more have an opportunity to excel in the server market At this point in time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has and AMD of the market That is because the current AMD offerings called the Opteron Series have a fraction of the horsepower of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>server chips as seen in the following chart But Zen will change all that and AMD will get a lot more than of the server market starting in I have been an enthusiastic supporter of AMD for almost a year now As time has passed I have become even more enthusiastic for all of the reasons listed above And I have not included the many possibilities from the GPU side of the business either My point is if most of these come true even if I am off by a quarter or two AMDs stock will soar based upon the anticipation that profits and maybe significant profits are on the horizon And this does not include the possibility of a spinoff of the graphics division or an investmentacquisition by a rd party Now is the time
