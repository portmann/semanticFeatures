</span>processors fabric memory and Altera FPGAs Dominating the telecom data center business will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>DCG Data Center Group to double its revenues from billionplus to over billion in less than five years While the first use of FPGAs integrated into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors will be in the Data Center these will be followed by uses that increase the IoT addressable market by b On June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC announced the planned purchase of Altera NASDAQ ALTR At the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expected the closing to be in months Now the merger is expected to be completed on December months good performance Diane Bryant summarized the benefits to the Data Center Group at the Global Technology Conference in June Expands the use of FPGA acceleration Reduces total cost of ownership by using standard server infrastructure Increase flexibility by allowing for rapid implementation of customer IP and algorithms Onethird of Cloud Service Providers could use FPGAs by Cloud Service Providers can accelerate one application such as image identification across many servers Security appliance vendors can reprogram for customerspecific solutions such as encryption Network functions such as virtual switching can migrate from ASIC function to FPGA with more flexibility The transformation of the telecom business from primarily ASIC and RISC single purpose processors to XEON FPGA general purpose and more flexible processors is an billion market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to grow into Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>only addresses billion of this billion market providing lots of room to grow using FPGAs Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Altera have created discrete products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>produces a CPU and Altera produces an FPGA They are then used together The next step with the purchase of Altera will be to copackage the CPU with an FPGA increasing the performance Then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will integrate the CPU and FPGA on the same silicon further increasing performance and decreasing costs and increasing value to customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also provided examples for use of integrated die and multichip packages in IoT Two major IoT uses for integrated FPGAsIntel IP include Industrial automation real time control and enhanced security replacement of ASSPs Advance vehicle driver assistance systems including safety D vision proprietary acceleration replacement of ASICs The integration of processor FPGA memory controller security and standard IO will add new functionality improve performance and lower cost of IoT Lower cost integrated FPGA units will grow Intels IoT SAM serviceable addressable market by billion by as they replace ASICs and ASSPs Currently thr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IoT Group has revenues of about billion Customers will be able to program their own IP into an FPGA without the risks and delays associated with ASICs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can preprogram industryspecific IP to replace ASSPs Perhaps one of the biggest advantages of integration of FPGAs in the IoT world will be to cut the time to market by at least half Intels strong fab abilities will increase the performance and decrease the cost of Alteras existing products Altera and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>engineering teams will create an integrated device manufacturer approach enabling faster design optimization and time to market These benefits will result in higher revenues and higher margins for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Altera products as costs are lowered performance increased and increased value is provided to customers Intels purchase of Altera will provide new markets for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>while decreasing costs increasing performance and meeting more needs of a greater pool of customers New addressable markets resulting from the purchase of Altera include b in the data center business and b in the IoT business for a total of b This is huge considering Intels current total revenues are expected to be around b in The purchase of Altera provides a huge increase in the addressable market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>while increasing the value of Intels processors and other IP through increased integration Integration is essential to decreasing the size power use and cost of new technology Integration of FPGAs into Intels other IP provides customers increased flexibility speed to market and improved performance in a smaller and more energy efficient unit Integration of FPGAs will create new solutions and new profits for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the near term and for many years to come Integration of FPGAs with other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IP is a big step to making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a clear winner as a growth stock Analysts need to recognize the huge value that Altera brings to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and adjust their targets to reflect the growth that will result from the integration of FPGAs with other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IP Near term targets above are easily justified based on current earnings and PE ratio of to with the higher PE ratio reflecting the great growth that will result from integrating Altera FPGAs with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IP We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the
