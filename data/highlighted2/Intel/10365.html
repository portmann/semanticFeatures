class='textDiv'>Microsoft Is Safe And Stable Ignore Volatility Buy The Dip Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsoft was hit by a spate of bad news which has put downward pressure on the stock PC shipment forecasts currency and piracy issues will negatively impact earnings and sales Despite these risk factors the business is heavily diversified and is likely to withstand these negative catalysts Furthermore the company has a fortress balance sheet and trades at a reasonable valuation in comparison to broader indices Things dont look very good for the PC ecosystem as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC recently lowered its guidance IDC revised estimates lower Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has yet to release Windows And competing ecosystems are starting to gain more momentum Based on all of this negativity its not hard to imagine why investors are dumping Microsoft stock I just think that the headlines have completely ignored what Microsoft is doing right and are underestimating the quality of Microsofts earnings going forward Therefore I think investors should consider buying the stock while its at lower levels as I anticipate FY will have much more momentum behind it due to stabilization in FX and momentum in the universal app ecosystem thats going to power Microsoft into a variety of devices We further asked to make sure that the announcement means the following is technically possible During this oneyear period after Windows s launch anyone can pirate Windows or Windows x and then upgrade to Windows for free Correct anyone in the world with a qualified device can upgrade a pirated copy of Windows to Windows the Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to VentureBeat When taking into consideration that people can take a illegitimate copy of Windows and upgrade into a legitimate and more recent version of Windows investors have to account for a potential dropoff in licensing sales Admittedly chasing after the various users that actively break the terms and conditions of any OS licensing agreement would be a fruitless endeavor by Microsoft as litigation wouldnt yield much in the way of settlements as the people actively pirating copies of Microsoft dont have money to begin with hence they steal older copies of Windows What could Microsoft win in a court room from people who have no money to begin with The OSlicensing business tends to perform better on the enterprise front over the consumer because enterprises are more responsive to legal liability After all if Microsoft were to litigate a midsized company for not licensing Windows the midsized business will have to answer to a judge that will rule in favor of Microsoft Hence Microsofts enterprise division accounts for the majority of revenue and it will likely stay that way for the foreseeable future Intels recent comments which I will quote from SA Transcripts is a little alarming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now expects Q revenue of BB below prior guidance of BB and a B consensus Gross margin guidance remains at with lower volumes offset by higher ASPs All other expectations have been withdrawn that presumably includes fullyear guidance for midsingle digit revenue growth Guidance will be updated during Intels April Q report The reduction in revenue outlook shouldnt come as any surprise as IDC recently lowered their estimates on PC market demand as well Worldwide PC shipments will fall further than forecast this year as the strong US dollar and the lack of new products threaten sales researcher IDC said Shipments will drop percent in instead of the previous forecast for percent decline the Framingham Massachusettsbased research firm said in a statement Thursday PC sellers bought more computers than anticipated in the last three months of to boost inventory before Microsoft Corp started to scale back subsidies in early while the strong dollar is crimping PC exports the researcher said The key word from IDC was foreign exchange impacts and the lack of new products That implies that the research firm is anticipating a minor reduction in shipments because Microsoft has yet to launch Windows while currency exchange has strengthened the greenback against a basket of currency pairs Given Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL price products from the perspective of the dollar the firm is likely responding to higher pricing on a currency adjusted basis in foreign markets Following that rationale Microsofts international revenue will be negatively affected to a certain extent Despite an underwhelming earnings outlook from the prior quarter Microsoft looks a lot more attractive at current levels And while many technical analysts would argue that a stock trading below the day MA is a risky gamble I think theres a reasonable likelihood of a payoff when operating on a multiyear time frame Source Microsoft Annual Report If we look very closely Microsofts revenue from the PC operating system is only representative of of revenue So even if licensing revenue were to drop by yearoveryear the impact on sales would be million to billion When taking into consideration Microsoft has many rapid growth businesses in enterprise services hardware and Office the impact on earnings is likely to be negligible Furthermore Microsoft isnt really all that expensive in comparison to the broader market Microsoft trades at times earnings and pays a dividend yield better than the year US treasury bond without any significant risk of default as the company has billion in liquid assets on the balance sheet and billion in debt Thats a pretty good ratio and is probably as safe if not safer to own than some foreign bonds Also lets not forget that Microsoft has a diversity of businesses both domestically and internationally which means its not that exposed to certain business segments or geographic regions Currently the forward SP price target by Morgan Stanley is based on a earnings multiple Microsofts forward PE is which is a little less expensive than the forecasted PE for the SP Not only that Microsoft carries considerably less risk and is trading at a bit of a discount in comparison to its earlier highs I have high conviction that the stock is relatively cheap when taking into consideration the risk profile and forward looking growth estimates Currently the consensus analyst estimate calls for a reduction in EPS yearoveryear but its entirely possible for Microsoft to beat those expectations as Microsoft isnt that reliant on the consumer PC business for revenue Despite the challenging business environment facing Microsoft the business is diversified enough to absorb issues pertaining to piracy falling PC shipments and currency effects Therefore investors should look to buy Microsoft opportunistically at these lower levels as theres a high margin of safety to both top and bottom line I anticipate a recovery in sales and earnings in FY as new products stabilization in FX will make for better looking comps and will also improve sentiment which will drive multiple expansion in the next calendarfiscal year Source Microsoft Is Safe And Stable Ignore Volatility Buy The Dip Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
