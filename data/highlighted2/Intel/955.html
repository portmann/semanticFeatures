Micron The MicronIntel partnership has created industryleading NAND Flash memory technology and developed a robust global manufacturing network IMFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Micron Flash Technology the joint venture between the two companies is currently working on the D NAND technology which is expected to be an important growth driver for the NAND market In this article we discuss how an early entry in the D NAND market can help Micron increase its NAND market share Currently the company derives of its revenue and of its valuation as per our estimate from the NAND Flash market Accounting for around of the market Micron is the fourth largest player in the NAND Flash segment after Samsung OTCSSNLF Toshiba and SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK D NAND is a type of flash memory that stacks memory die on top of each other within a single package using specialized interconnects The vertical stacking allows for a significantly higher density of memory cells and improves performance and reliability D NAND is a breakthrough in overcoming the density limit currently facing the planar D NAND architecture and floating gates used in conventional flash memory as well as yielding speed and endurance improvements D NAND has a more dense chip with twice the write performance and times the reliability of planar NAND DNANDcellarchitectureenablessignificantperformance and cost improvement relative toplanartechnology TrendForce currently projects D NAND will account for only of the NAND Flash industrys overall supply since the majority of the manufacturers are still in the testing and sample delivery phase However it expects the D NAND market share to reach by According to IHS research D NAND technology will account for the majority of total flash shipments equivalent to by Micron Will Start Commercial Production Of D NAND In The Second Half Of Though Samsung Is Already A Step Ahead Micron Is Way Ahead Of Other NAND Players Micron in collaboration with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>commenced early D NAND samples in Q and expect volume commercial production in the second half of calendar year While the first generation D NAND is on track for production in Singapore the second generation is under development in Boise In its investor meeting in November last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced that its D NAND solution in collaboration with Micron has already reached the prototype stage and the drives will be available by mid The first drives will likely have capacities in the range of several terabytes and be targeted at enterprise buyers Though the drives may be very expensive initially in the long run the technology could drive down prices and make SSDs with one to four terabytes of storage more affordable for consumers It also could be used to construct physically smaller drives making it more applicable for laptop and tablets At its investor conference last month Micron mentioned that the introduction of this disruptive nonvolatile memory architecture will drive exciting new applications Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>process architecture targets to achieve the highest bits per square mm of any vertical NAND solution The MicronIntel D NAND solution will be at cost parity with the current nm planar node as soon as its released see the graph below The TLC D offering will be cheaper than the industry bestofbreed nm planar offering Additionally the performance of D NAND is far better with more durability writes of data and better density in terms of data bits per square millimeter of circuit board space compared to Dplanar NAND Samsung which accounts for of the NAND Flash market launched its D VNAND storage technology in August and has already started mass production of the technology SanDisk market share and partner Toshiba market sahre wont have a D NAND offering until SK Hynix market share has yet to reveal specific D roadmaps methodology and timing While Samsung clearly has the first mover advantage Micron too can benefit from the early entry in the D NAND technology By the time SanDisk Toshiba and SK Hynix come up with a D NAND offering both Samsung and Micron will be several generations ahead and will have solved the teething problems of controller design and other architectural issues We believe that an early entry in the D NAND market can help Micron increase its share visvis SanDisk Toshiba and SK Hynix Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on
