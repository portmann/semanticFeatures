Analysts below Intels Q revenue guidance midpoint IDC reports Q PC sales fell more than expected On Tuesday afternoon well get a third quarter earnings report from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC While shares of the company recently crossed for the first time since June expectations seem to be low as the PC market remains weak In this article I preview the companys earnings report discussing the major items investors need to watch for Analysts are currently looking for billion in Q revenues down from the prioryear period While this number is within Intels range for the quarter analysts are a little below the billion midpoint management guided to On the bottom line analysts are looking for EPS of down from in the period Using Intels guidance and the most recent quarterly diluted share count the company roughly forecast in EPS for the period The first major item investors will be looking at is what management has to say about the PC space IDC recently reported a drop in Q sales larger than its projection for On the other hand Gartner estimated a fall IDC reports that the PC channel was focused on clearing Windows inventory ahead of the Windows launch While reviews of the new operating system have been favorable it seems a number of existing users have taken advantage of Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT upgrade program Thus sales of new hardware have been soft so far according to IDC The PC industry represents Intels largest revenue and profit center so any weakness will pressure results Perhaps the most important item Im watching for is a discussion on how Intels mobile efforts are coming During the Q conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CFO Stacy Smith gave the following statement Tablet unit volumes were million units up year over year We are on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by million with about a third of the improvement realized to date That statement implies that roughly rd of profitability improvement will come in the second half of the year Recently Digitimes reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was planning to end price discounts for its Bay Trail tablet CPUs in October If this is true you would expect a significant amount of loss improvement in Q meaning Q probably wouldnt see too many gains Intels Mobile and Communications Group under its old reporting structure reported an operating loss of more than billion in so cutting losses here is key to Intels longterm earnings potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>usually provides some form of forecast for its future period at its Investor Meeting in late November so Ill be listening to hear if the company can further reduce mobile losses next year as it makes a sustained push into tablets and smartphones Last week a report stated that EU regulators had approved Intels purchase of Altera NASDAQ ALTR and the deal is expected to close in the next quarter or two There have been many skeptics of the deal primarily due to the price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is paying The key will be how quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to achieve cost synergies in the deal Intels operating expenses have been steadily rising in recent years which have significantly hampered the companys bottom line If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>goes through another full year of major restructuring expenses it will be hard for the company to significantly increase its earnings per share The other half of this equation relates to Intels share repurchase plan As management detailed on the Q call it expects to get back to zero net cash sometime during the second half of The company is taking on a significant amount of debt to finance the Altera deal Management has stated that the buyback is the last real use of cash after capex the dividend and acquisitions Thus I dont expect significant share repurchases in the next couple of quarters and that could lead Intels outstanding share count to start rising again If that happens earnings per share will be pressured Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already needs to achieve enough profitability from the Altera segment to offset the interest expenses it will be incurring to achieve the purchase The final key to this puzzle will be capital spending Originally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guided for capex of billion for but the company reduced that expectation down to billion as of the Q report Will we get another cut at the Q report If so free cash flow will benefit and that could be key to a potential dividend raise in Once we get all of the Q numbers and some more clarity on next years forecast Ill examine the dividend angle in more detail As seen in the chart below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares recently broke above their day moving average for the first time in a couple of months A strong earnings report could help the stock stay above this key technical level which would provide support to the recent breakout This could set up the bullish golden cross where the day moving average eventually breaks above the day Expectations are a little low going into the report with analysts calling for a decline in Intels revenues compared to managements most recent guidance for a decrease If the PC market isnt too weak and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is finally able to cut some of its mobile losses the company should be set up for a strong with a return to EPS growth We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
