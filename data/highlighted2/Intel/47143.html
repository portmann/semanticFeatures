Alpha Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are both openly agnostic having no preference for chip architecture or operating system and able to use all chip architectures and all operating systems Behind the scenes reveals through connecting the dots that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft are working closely to build on each others technical advances When this behind the scenes collaboration and the resulting financial benefits become more obvious to stock market analysts Intels stock rise will accelerate The primary financial benefit will come from a higher level of excitement around new technological advances in chips peripherals operating systems and apps Since my focus is on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC this article is entitled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside Microsoft The opposite also is true that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products running on Windows The big change over the last five years is that both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft are distancing themselves from the Wintel label so they can more effectively market their wares to a wider audience This agnostic outward image does not stop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft from working closely together Brian Krzanich <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO has said that he meets monthly with the CEO of Microsoft and he quickly adds that he also meets monthly with the CEO of Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL In January Microsoft made a big splash with Halolens Halolens allows for an untethered personal computing experience with various windows showing up on surfaces around your home or office Real Sense Development and demonstration of Real Sense technology has been touted heavily over the last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has driven the technology smaller and smaller In early it was a standalone device Later in it was demonstrated in laptop and then tablet forms Most recently at IDF in Shenzhen Real Sense was shown in a smaller mobile phone form Real Sense likely has a huge role in Halolens Compute power <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is always driving their computing power higher in smaller form factors The latest leading edge is nm FinFET Later this year we will likely hear more about nm production in Halolens needs the high performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips to drive the Halolens computing Wireless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for the last year has emphasized wireless computing No wires for charging No wires for docking Halolens likely uses Intels wireless charging and wireless connection to other computing devices Halolens over time will grow into a huge market as the headset gets reduced down to the size of a pair of sunglasses Electronic gadgets that start out clunky quickly are shrunk into smaller form factors This smaller and smaller drive comes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>providing further support that Microsoft Halolens has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely provide a unified architecture for Microsoft Halolens The CPU GPU and HPU are all likely made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The CPU and GPU are likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>designs and the HPU is most likely a collaboration between Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>These three processors will shrink with Intels nm technology and likely be integrated into an SOC for an even smaller form factor using less battery and producing less head heating from the heavy processing Maybe Intels nm technology will allow the creation of a sport version of the Halolens where the user can move around more quickly and have the processor keep up with the heavy processing needed to recalculate all of the D surfaces and vectors The Windows continuum will allow the Windows Phone to act as a PC with wireless connections to dumb laptops as well as large screenskeyboardsmousespeakers Again Intels ability to drive high performance computing smaller will be critical to the success of this concept At Microsoft Build a mockup was shown of this concept and the point was made that the hardware needed to accomplish using a phone as a PC does not exist right now Intels new processors will bring this high powered computing to the phone form factor first with nm Skylake SOC processors in and then with nm versions in Intels WiDi fits right in with this Windows continuum concept allowing highspeed wireless connection between the Windows Phone and another screen and peripherals High quantity sales of Halolens and Windows Phone that can act as a PC are likely one to two years away but with huge upside potential Microsoft Halolens and Windows Phone with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside are only in the demonstration phase now and likely wont be available in significant quantity until mid to late However with more and more announcements regarding Microsoft development of these products and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>development of the chip technology to make these innovations possible both Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will shine as growth prospects increase This indication of future growth and associated shine is a critical driver to the Price to Earnings ratio PE As noted in my previous article titled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Train is Leaving the Station the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>PE Ratio has varied from a low of to a high of The low occurred when analysts were focusing on the notion that the PC was dying and analysts had little appreciation for the profits that would soon arrive from the Data Center Group which now makes up of Intels earnings The high of was reached as sales of PCs in the fourth quarter of reached their annual peak and as analysts began to understand the magnitude of the Data Center Group growing profits The PE Ratio has now dropped down to about as the first quarter historically lowest quarter of the year PC sales were released Analysts better understand that the Data Center Group profits will likely continue to increase per year as DCG sales increase per year Analysts better understand that the PC is not dead more personal computing is now moving to new forms as Moores Law drives processors smaller and smaller with the next forms including the Windows Phone and Halolens with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside Holding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings constant and changing the PE Ratio dramatically increases the share price For example with earnings per share of and the current PE ratio of the share price is With a PE Ratio of the share price is close to With a PE ratio of the share price becomes If the earnings increase to per share with increased PC sales decreased mobile losses and continuation of Data Center Group profit increases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price could reach in with
