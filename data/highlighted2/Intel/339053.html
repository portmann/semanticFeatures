Fundamental analysis can aid in picking the right options chain Weve been writing a series of articles about selling puts to buy dividendpaying stocks at a particular price As weve mentioned in previous articles the most rewarding aspect of writing on Seeking Alpha is hearing from readers that they learned something new from an article That feeling gets better when you discover a readers perspective has changed on a particular strategy in this case options in general and selling puts in specific So if the readers have learned something already why continue the series Two reasons One we cover different stocks look at their respective chains and pick a strike and premium that make sense fundamentally as well Two this series has also been used as a means to find the second technology stock for our portfolio besides Apple NASDAQ AAPL So far Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT have been profiled among technology stocks Now its time to look at another oldtech stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and its option chain Please refer to this article to recap the basics of selling puts An Example Below is Intels option chain which expires on Jan Lets pick the put for example For selling one contract one contract shares you need to have a cash balance of in your account per share times shares in a contract to cover the possible purchase of shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The premium on this particular put is likely to be between and per contract depending on the day That would net you a premium of say for one contract <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is well above at the time of expiration Your option expires worthless and you net a cool for about months of your willingness to set aside on this contract Remember your is not locked up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>beyond this point This trade gives you more than double the current yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offers for buying shares Risk If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>really rockets up from here your option returns will be lower than the stock returns This may happen but given this stocks history it has a habit of being range bound for an extended period of time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors will remember the mid s range the stock was stuck in for years on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is at or below and you are obligated to buy shares at Remember you already netted per share when you sold the put So your cost basis is essentially As long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is above this you will have a net positive return when this option chain expires Risk The risk in this scenario is that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>really tanks in the next months and trades below you will still have to buy your shares at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been increasing dividends almost every single year since But the company broke one of the commandments of dividend growth investing when it paid the same annual dividend of cents per share in both and But it at least maintained the dividend without reducing or eliminating even for one quarter The dividends have since been increased twice going up from cents a year to cents a year to Given how the current payout ratio is at we expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to announce another dividend increase in November of this year Going by the last two increases and we are optimistic about a increase this year That would give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a yield of if you must buy shares at when this chain expires next year As can be seen here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has had a yield above only for a few days in the last five years If the chain expires worthless youd still be left with your return A winwin Based on the EPS estimate of a purchase at would represent a multiple of Thats well below the average multiple of that the stock has traded at in the recent years On the business front things are looking up as well A recent SA News piece indicated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is likely to supply up to of the modems in Apples upcoming iPhone While Intels revenue will go up a notch or two because of this in the short term the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now foraying into Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM kingdom is the one to watch in the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also expects its data center business to grow at per year a high target But even if the company manages anywhere close to here itd be a big win as data center chips tend to have higher margin With the explosive growth in cloud expect more companies to jump onto the data center business Irrespective of which cloud company wins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is likely to provide its share of data center chips to all the competitors Analysts are starting to note this obviously as this upgrade suggests To summarize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is definitely another candidate we are evaluating for our portfolio Microsoft still leads but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cisco are going neck to neck To conclude the article wed like to list out the frequent comments and scenarios posted by readers in this series so far Using the premium against the sale Not all brokers seem to require you to set aside the entire to be able to sell one contract at the strike price of Some readers commented that their brokers let them execute the trade by subtracting the premium For example if the premium for the contract is supposed to be some brokers allow you to sell one contract if you have in your account Our experience has always been to set aside the full amount but its important to note this feedback from the readers Option Expiration Some readers suggested buyingselling closer chains than one year out That is a chain that expires in three months for example Yes it can be done for a lower premium but the option to use your capital elsewhere after the chain expires In short many ways to do it pick the one you are most comfortable with We like six monthtooneyear contracts as they give us more wiggle room Covered Calls Covered calls seem to be preferred by some readers as well This is generally a good way to enhance your income if you own shares already We dont do this as often as selling puts and do not feel comfortable preaching something we dont do often Buying outright but at what cost Some prefer just buying the shares outright and not messing with options Obviously this is the most used method but not every investor likes to buy a stock at any price the market gives Some prefer a particular entry point even if its the best stock and this strategy works for such investors to pick a time and price for their shares Margin Some brokers allow some investors to go on margin that is borrowing money from the broker to execute your trade But margincall is one of the most hated terms in the options world This happens when the broker demands additional money to meet the minimum maintenance margin We suggest the average readerinvestor try cashsecured puts first before getting into the murky world of margin I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
