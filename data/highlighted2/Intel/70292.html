highmargin Data Center Group If a share offer is the magic number that makes this a pricey transaction but it remains in the ball park <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC needs to acquire Altera NASDAQ ALTR as a mechanism to protect its server business and extend its penetration into data center communications and storage products as well as other markets A couple of months ago the Wall Street Journal reported that INTC and ALTR were in acquisition talks Within the next week or so it was reported that the talks had broken off after no agreement could be reached Since then we had heard unconfirmed reports that a number of ALTRs larger shareholders expressed displeasure that the presumed share offer was rejected Keep in mind that ALTRs stock was trading at share the day before the rumor hit the market The most common question on the INTC side of this equation seemed to be Why Altera because they would only represent about of INTCs revenue First INTCs Data Center Group DCG is its highest growth segment as well as having the highest profitability see Figure As you can see it grew about for the trailing months ending March and is expected to generate midteens growth for the next several years Equally important is the margin structure of DCG which is more than higher than the Client Group The reason for the higher margins is that INTC can price based upon value to the customer in an environment that offers little in the way of alternatives Additionally the highest growth part of DCG is its cloud customers who are willing to pay more for semicustom parts that deliver higher performance Cloud customers were growing north of as of the companys last analyst meeting representing about of server units but of revenue Last fall INTC had custom SKUs stock keeping units for cloud customers going to this year and was willing to do fullcustom silicon given the volumes the cloud players generate However the second issue is that those same cloud customers and others would certainly love to have an alternative solution that may provide the benefit of price pressure if only for the benefit of negotiating power At some point investors should expect a viable ARMbased solution will enter the market Most sellside analysts have the alternatives ultimately gaining about a share of the existing xbased server business over the next several years You can argue whether this market share figure is high or low but the point is the samethere will be competition So how does INTC fend off this competition Simplerun faster than your competition and do things the others cant The company has long been known for its manufacturing prowess and that translates into the ability to push its process technology faster than the competition and manufacture in volume on the leading edge That may keep most of the traditional enterprise customers in the fold but the cloud players and other highperformance computing HPC applications may be looking for more Enter ALTR and its field programmable gate arrays FPGA FPGAs consist of logic blocks and memory that can be connected by an engineer at a customer hence field programmable to perform a repetitive task that may be common to that customer or application Within the data center FPGAs are increasingly being used in server communications and storage applications to perform repetitive functions As an example an Ethernet switch might use a FPGA to encrypt and decrypt data on the fly as it exits and enters the confines of the data center The same field programmability is attractive to the cloud customers in prepping data to be processed on their servers or in performing analytics As ALTR has had plans to use INTC as its foundry at the nanometer NM process node the two have a working relationship To the best of my knowledge INTC still plans to add ALTRs FPGA as a frontend in the same package with some of its server parts This plan seems to confirm the wisdom of offering additional customization capabilities via the FPGA The next logical step would be to integrate the FPGA logic onto the server silicon itself The FPGA market is a billion market growing in the highsingle digits and is dominated by two companies Xlinix with about market share and ALTR with about share They have been replacing many application specific integrated circuits ASIC a billion market and declining since they arrived in the late s Consequently they are used across a very broad array of endmarkets particularly when timetomarket is an important criterion That broad endmarket exposure also becomes a plus for INTC as it searches for diversification away from the PC INTC and ALTR are not all that dissimilar financially As you can see in Figure the margin structure between the two is quite comparable as both deliver value to their respective customers Both generate solid cash flow yields but because INTC has wafer fabrication facilities its free cash flow yield CFOCapexRevenue is substantially lower but thats to be expected So the question from our perspective becomes what should INTC pay for ALTR Lets start with the semiconductor transactions that have taken place in the recent past for valuation metrics see Figure What we see is that value is in the eye of the beholder it always is or we wouldnt have the delightful repartee that commentary elicits here at SA For deals perceived to be strategic the acquirer is willing to pay more versus the bolton deals at the opposite end of the spectrum We arrive at a median value of x trailing sales Source SEC Filings company reports If the rumored share valuation is indeed correct investors would be looking at a billion transaction or about x trailing revenue Not inexpensive by any means but at the same time not wildly out of the ball park or the most expensive What becomes critical will be how to structure such a transaction and that obviously is left to the bankers However lets throw out some what ifs INTC has billion in cash net cash billion but is generating about billion of cash from operations each year Shortterm debt coupled with some of the existing cash say the net position of billion could be used and then paid off with the cash generated by operations Given the current low rate environment by my calculations billion of debt at would generate a hit to EPS Keep in mind that the net cost of the transaction will be reduced by the value of ALTRs net cash or about billion Assuming ALTRs operations will continue to expand as FPGAs continue to take market share from ASICs there is the potential to grow their margins as well by leveraging INTCs manufacturing That should enhance cash flow from the ALTR side From my perspective what we dont want to see is the issuance of shares for all or part of the transaction INTC has been doing a solid job of reducing its shares outstanding returning cash to shareholders by about million or of the total over the last months Issuing shares for MA puts a halt on your ability to repurchase shares Repaying debt from the cash generation may mitigate the repurchase program for a while but it doesnt legally prohibit you from doing so The bottom line from my perspective is that the acquisition of ALTR would Continue to allow INTC to separate from any competitors Enable it to maintain a very high margin DCG Provide an entry
