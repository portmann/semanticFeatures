offshore and B in debtcommercial paper Dividend Apple has declared a share quarterly dividend up from a prior share and good for a yield at current afterhours levels The dividend is payable on May to shareholders on record as of the May close Tim Cook Our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds Apple says it plans to continue tapping US and foreign debt markets to help fund capital returns I think Apple just prove that China is really being hit harder than we thought So much for Tim Cooks comments that China sales remained strong China gov is shutting down Apple services and they want iphone source code but Apple is refusing Its not easy to gain traction when you have the gov against you in a country like China Yes the Chinese govt is but Apple recently endorsed DJI a Chinese startup that has taken a real leadership position in an emerging technology I figured that such a move by someone who holds as much klout as Apple does may put the company in a better light in the eyes of the Chinese govt dont u feel like some people around here are like years old kids at school to which you need to say A B C D E F and again A B C D E F Look at China And those that said the China slowdown was overblown Wow International sales make up of revenue Their only growth vehicle is the services division which is great No time to increase buyback Or its the seasonal selling of iPhones Its not the holidays And they havent upgraded the phone in a great way in years iTunes is a dead business App store relies on new sales of hardware plus recurring subs on apps that can easily migrate to Android Apple care relies on new hardware sales Apple Pay will never make any real money Apple Music is the only one worth something and it faces a lot of competition I wouldnt pay x for that services business Keep in mind iPhone se came out towards the very end of the quarter thus not reflecting the full iPhone sales picture Its a very strong buy at And you know that next earnings result is gonna be epic with the full iPhone se sales picture Picked up a ton at now except the SE impacted in the very weak guidance so either sales of SE are terrible or they have cannibalised S sales sorry but your nuts and youre going to loose a ton of money Ask yourself this simple question what product or major upgrade will Apple release in the next year that will really move the needle Keep in mind that MacRummours Apple insider and all the rest are crawling over ever leak and that would be nothing The only slightly interesting thing was the home key going and being replaced by force touch and that was with the Iphone coming out in and not having an iPhone If you cant imagine or see on the grape vine a product moving the needle in the coming year you really shouldnt be sleeping well at night with all your money tied in Apple Apple committed to return B more from now till Buying today at B you are getting returned to you in yrs at x But I thought there werent any SE customers because no one is buying it Cant have it both ways partner Ohon CNBC they just said it is dead Melissa Barrack Obama is the man Lee looked ight into the camera and said its dead Where are all the Apple bulls tonight with their China wont affect Apple now it is clear why I am seeing discount offers allover the place on S They cant sell them Zed Still here Apple wasnt the only tech with a slow quarter GOOG MSFT just to name a few cant expect the best company to produce good numbers during a world slowdown LOL Why is this even a surprise This is what happens when those value investors only focus on profitability with no attention paid to growth One of the worst stock market fails ever and the small odd lot shareholders are once again left speechless and financially whacked Apple guided for a bad quarter and they delivered one The other major factor hurting margins was no new macs released Been waiting for a new mac book pro and a Mac Pro for nearly a year Those will likely come at wwdc in June if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has compelling chips to offer All eyes will be on iphone If it indeed has a significantly better camera that will be my reason to upgrade do you think anyone and I mean anyone is affected by your ridiculous hyperbole Its a slight miss And they still made BILLIONS of dollars Looked like another bullseye on their own guidance to me Maybe the analysts should be punished for getting it wrong yet again I dont think people can count on the SE They didnt have the SE before Also in China with or without their slowing down there are more options on phones Just look at huawei and Xiaomi plus Samsung I really dont know where Tims confidence is coming from The Margin of iPhones being better than others are
