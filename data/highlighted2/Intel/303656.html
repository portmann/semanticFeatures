Hurt The Markets Again Cramers Mad Money Seeking Alpha The Fed does it again Their wishywashy statement on interest rates today left stocks sinking back into oblivion after a nice rally on Tuesday said Cramer They did not rule out a rate hike possibility in March which means that investors will have to wait and watch as the stocks get crushed Cramer went back to his checklist which lists the issues that need to be resolved before the market can find a bottom The checklist still has most boxes unchecked which is a bad sign Fed has not ruled out a March rate hike political uncertainty has not gotten better China still shows a slowdown with Shanghai Index below key level commodities have not stopped their free fall strong dollar continues to weigh on bottom line of companies no sizable merger and acquisition activity or leadership from tech stocks apart from FANG stocks With so many issues looming investors should be cautious and wait on the sidelines with cash Just when we thought the Fed could do the job they let us down again We are back into a world of hurt until we can start checking off these darned boxes said Cramer CEO interview Core Labs NYSE CLB Core Labs is a hightech oil services company which is also known as the scientist of the oil patch It uses its technology to analyze rock fluids on oil reservoirs to maximize oil output for drillers The companys stock has fallen from its highs in the last years but is still profitable It reported inline earnings and better than expected revenues with lowered guidance Cramer interviewed CEO David Demshur to know his views on the price of crude and the companys prospects Our mission is to help our clients produce more oil and gas every day But more importantly to produce more oil and gas from the assets they have said Demshur He also expects demand and supply for oil will balance towards the second half of The depletion rate of wells is M barrels a day which means that much new capacity needs to come up to maintain capacity The demand for oil is expected to rise by M barrels a day which means that oversupply will dry up soon The current oil glut is nothing like since there was spare capacity of M barrels a day then compared to about M a day currently Apple reported on Tuesday and the question how to value Apple is on Cramers mind That is the conundrum facing Apple the greatest wealth creator of our generation said Cramer Analysts are just adjusting numbers of phones price targets inventory every quarter which puts Apple in the basket of other hardware companies like HP NYSE HPQ EMC NYSE EMC or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC All this brings the conclusion that Apple owns the cellphone market which is saturated as it reported its first down year The fact that Apple sold approx M iPhones which is an alltime high serves as a peak in sales and not good news Analysts cant find something else to make up for peak iPhone sales as iPad and iWatch are not selling as much as they were earlier and Macs have reached a peak too Analysts have no cover and they dont want to downgrade the stock because its too cheap on earnings even if those earnings are going down They almost have cash per share which is a lot to be downgraded Hence analysts just keep adjusting their price targets Analysts are traditionalists who see peak everywhere I am a generalist not a technology analyst and I cant view Apple just like another hardware company said Cramer All hardware companies reported a lower average price and forex issues in the last few quarters but Apple didnt This is due to brand loyalty as Apples products are loved by all and its hard to put a priceearnings multiple on it One metric that was astounding and shows the brand loyalty was the service revenue which is the money paid for iTunes music app store licensing service parts iCloud and Apple Pay that grew YY to B in That is the number we need to key in on not how many devices they sell said Cramer Analysts will soon realize that the revenue streams will make the stock worth owning and it is a bargain at Own Apple dont trade it CEO interview PPG Industries NYSE PPG PPG Industries has been affected by the strong dollar The companys sales came in below expectations due to the strong dollar although it grew on a constant currency basis Cramer spoke to CEO Michael McGarry to know about the impact of the economy and falling oil prices on the companys bottom line Honestly falling oil is both a positive and a negative We are a supplier into the marine business we are a supplier in the oil business So Id rather be talking to our suppliers about innovation because innovation is what drives us said McGarry He sees more room to grow in the autos and China has more upside left Brazil will be down for the whole year He was disappointed with the aerospace build rates but expects growth to return in Q Overall he expects Mexico and Europe business to grow As Boeing NYSE BA cut its forecasts does it mean that the aerospace has peaked That doesnt mean the companies involved in the space are necessarily dead said Cramer United Technologies NYSE UTX reported a strong aircraft engine business which was attributed to the new geared turbo fan Weak forecasts from Boeing means companies do not need as many planes as thought earlier This could be due to low purchasing power or even Chinese rethinking demand The problem is more with Boeing than with aerospace Customers first need to buy US dollars to buy aircraft from Boeing so theyd rather buy from Airbus OTCPKEADSF which has lot of orders from Iran and has taken leadership from Boeing I think we need to lend some credence to the idea that we might have to factor in a possible aerospace peak said Cramer Tupperware NYSE TUP They had a poor last quarter and there needs to be a good explanation for it Hormel Foods NYSE HRL Wait for ugly days so that the stock goes down before one can buy Enterprise Products Partners
