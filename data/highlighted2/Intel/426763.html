AMD Is Not In A Hurry To Release ZenBased Processors Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha I agree with Hibbens thesis that a doubledown effort on Intels x processors is going to cause more pain to AMD Lisa Su has her own valid reasons why she is not in haste to release AMDs first generation of nm Zen processors The weak PC market is a valid excuse to not release new processors now Delaying Zen to will allow AMD to focus more resources on marketing affordable VRready Polaris GPUs This will help it compete better against Nvidia I agree with Hibbens idea that Intels NASDAQ INTC mobile retrenchment to focus on its x business is bad news for Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD My old <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>article also has the same needtofocusonxserverandpcmarket explanation why Krzanich decided to retreat from mobile processors On the other hand I do not think AMDs x business will die soon from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>redoubling its focus on the PC market The current status quo of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>dominating on PCserver processors will continue AMDs x business will also remain alive supplying its Carizzo and other nm processors to OEMs like HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY Hibbens lucid explanations degrading AMDs recent other weak product launches are also valid However Lisa Su definitely has her own stronger reasons why she is not in a hurry to roll out the Zenbased processors or highend Polaris GPUs My own take is that AMD is being prudent in withholding its full product pipeline As an old PokerStars player I understand the value of not playing your strongest cards early in the game Yes AMD is playing laggard or tight with its Zenbased processors and APUs Accelerated Processing Units Globalfoundries has been ready since November to produce AMDs nm Zenbased processors AMD recently received some cash from licensing its x server technology to Chinese folks AMD can easily pay Globalfoundries to start churning out Zen processors in sixfigure production volume However weak PC sales might be one of the reasons why AMD is being coy as to when will it really launch Zenbased processors Digitimes report also hinted that due to the weak PC market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD are not enthusiastic releasing new processors this year Business says its best to avoid launching new products when there is weak general demand I also believe that for this year AMD is more focused on regaining the market share in GPUs that it lost to Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Selling a latest generation Zenbased VRready Polaris GPU for is pretty aggressive answer to Nvidias GTX A delay in Zen processors as a means of focusing against Nvidia is certainly acceptable Debtladen AMD simply doesnt have the money to aggressively compete simultaneously against cashrich <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia AMDs rising stock might win more support if the company can get back to its Q level of market share almost in discreet GPUs Unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Nvidia has never been accused of dumping subsidized products to OEMs AMD will likely find it easier to compete with Pascal GPUs since Nvidia is not notorious for discounting its OEMbound video cards AMD is better off focusing first on improving its market share on GPUs Declining PC sales means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has tons of th generation and th generation x processors Releasing entrylevel or midrange Zen processors right now is not the best idea <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has lots of Bay Trail and Cherry Trail PCcompatible Atom mobile processors Yes Intels shelved SoFIAAtom x x x mobile processors can be used inside in laptops and desktop computers The current inventory of nm Atom processors not Apollo Lake makes it undesirable for AMD to release entrylevel Zen processors now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can quickly dump these Atoms on its dozens of PC vendor partners to immediately diminish the Zens chances of commercial success Lisa Su is likely waiting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to first dispose of its Atom processors before she even considers releasing Zenbased APUs Most marginsconscious PC manufacturers will ignore AMDs Zen processors if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>starts giving them dirt cheap Atom x or Atom x processors This is the curse of AMD Try as it may to create the best x processors it is still the PC manufacturers who ultimately decide the fate of new AMD processors On the other hand its a catandmouse game between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD AMD might just surprise us later this year with a commercialready midrangehighend Zen processor AMDs persistent disadvantage of having only nm processors means the nm Zen FX products might still come late this year The nm Zen is urgently needed to help AMD keep up with the higherend Skylake and Apollo Lake processors of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AMD customers HP and Lenovo sometimes still offer business laptops that do not contain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside While AMD only revealed an upgraded Carizzo laptop processor at Computex Event AMD Zen FX processors might still be launched by Q SemiAccurates Computexrelated article discussed that the Zenbased Summit Ridge processor is being sampled out now The only important thing to consider now is that AMDs Zen processors are not vaporware They are real products being tested by people Investors should not feel too anxious about the delay in the release of Zenbased processors AMDs management has its well thought out reasons for this Maybe one year from now other contributors here at Seeking Alpha will understand my explanation why Su has not yet released Zen CPUs I am long INTC and NVDA I do not have any bets on AMD but I greatly appreciate that Lisa Sus recent moves helped the stock outperform its peers this year Let us be patient and just wait for Lisa Sus next move Do not short AMD just because of pessimistic articles Do not go long AMD just because of this article too Investigate AMD Its a very risky stock handicapped by a persistent doubledigit short interest Make your own decision based on your calculated foresight
