style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making investments in new tech such as D image processing autonomous algorithms big data analytics and G communications The next big thing is likely to be devices that operate autonomously such as drones augmented reality headsets carsplanestrucks robots people satellites microbots anything that moves These devices will need to see be seentracked know what is expected and determine appropriate responses all with universally strong communication <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has lost lots of shine as its new ideas have not yet shown they can grow into revenue and profit currently this new tech is classified as expenses and losses Phones modems drones are so far expenses and losses However Intels investments in new tech are essential from the standpoint that the new tech keeps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>relevant in todays advancing tech world If they did not make these investments revenue would decline for sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has repeatedly stated the next big tech thing is not known but they want to be there when it happens To be there when it happens requires significant investments in a wide variety of areas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to be ready to support the next big tech thing with relevant hardware and software The most likely breakthrough areas will involve devices that see understand and respond Real Sense combined with Big Data and small powerful power sipping processors with FPGA features that adjust on the fly and G strong communication everywhere Think autonomous robotics drones cars microbots satellites Connection to the Internet with autonomous guidance think collision avoidance will at some point be required for anything that moves in public spaces Sure this new tech stuff will take years to develop market and produce profits Do not count on significant revenues and profits from autonomous devices in or The RD costs will initially likely exceed any revenues during the next two years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is building an entire platform for these autonomous devices They will be using IP developed or purchased for one are in multiple other areas within the autonomous device platform This platform includes the following components Powerful computing ability that can handle multiple complex calculations effortlessly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already has strong capabilities in this area with its Skylake and soon Kabylake processors nm and nm processors will be even more well suited for the task Small system on a chip to provide the necessary computing graphics communication in a small package Curie is a good example of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>making processors with communications smaller and smaller More work is needed in the SOC area with better graphics processing and modems Combining memory into such an SOC would be huge Real Sense D image processing is a critical component of any autonomous platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is developing smaller and more powerful Real Sense devices As these devices get smaller and more powerful they will be found in many devices that need to be aware of and understand their surroundings Power sipping processors sensors Real Sense memory modems will be critical for devices that move around autonomously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made great progress in reducing power needs and is committed to research into ways to have devices harvest power from their environment There is much work to be done in this area still FPGA features in a processor will be a key component of this platform Pattern recognition algorithms are constantly improving and need to have the ability to be modified in the field Intels work to combine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs and FPGAs will be critical for this platform to succeed Big Data Analytics will be critical to inform autonomous devices regarding what they see so that the device can instantly determine the appropriate response Intels work to make Big Data Analytics more accessible is critical to having devices determine the appropriate response to the multitude of objects it will see with Real Sense image processing Finally G will be critical to provide for near instantaneous movement of complex D image processing data from an autonomous device to the cloud and back again with understanding of the images and appropriate responses Intels work with numerous companies to create the G system is a critical component of this autonomous device platform Drones Nearly four million commercial drones are expected to sell this year rising to million a year by according to a new report by Juniper Research in the estimate was total drones in existence by Satellites Currently in space By more than launched per year including micro satellites estimate We are talking about hundreds of millions of likely autonomous devices per year by with a market in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year by These estimates are likely low as the number of autonomous devices will likely dramatically increase as the technology gets
