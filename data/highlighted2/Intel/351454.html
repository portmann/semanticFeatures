Zens Release Will Be Taking Names And Kicking Bandwidth Sooner Rather Than Later Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMDs Zen is their first significant CPU chip release since the Athlon in Combining Zen with AMDs new GPUs and HBM will give AMD some unique high end products Closing of million NantongFujitsu deal next quarter will provide cash to speed up delivery time The good news for Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD continues Recently it has introduced several new GPUs which have received excellent reviews It has also announced the soontobereleased NM GPU chip Polaris which should show up by Q at the latest And the sale of AMDs SATS Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services should close soon providing AMD with the cash M it needs to accelerate delivery of the new products But it is the production and delivery of Zen that will provide the rocket boost for AMDs share price Scheduled for delivery in Q Zen NM CPUs combined with AMDs advanced new graphic chips and HighBandwidthMemory HBM will allow AMD to have a product superior to any competitors at least for a while For the last years AMD has survived barely with the technological equivalent of duct tape and baling wire But in it will produce products that are equivalent or superior to competitors products The result will be a significant acceleration in its sales earnings and share price In this article I will continue a theme I have developed over the past year I think that AMD can get to share as I outlined here Reasons Why AMD Will Be By here More Reasons Why AMD Will Be In and here AMD Multiple Catalysts Will Drive A Double In And Another Double In Source Aurich Lawson arstecnicacom My basic premise is based upon AMD not being short on cash this year In operating cash flow was a negative million the th year in a row OCF has been negative This is the result mainly of PC sales going negative and AMDs obsolete in most cases NM Bulldozer cores struggling for market share at the low end of the desktop and laptop market The Zen will solve both problems with a more than competitive NM product and entry into the higher margin desktop gamers and server markets Currently AMD markets a Fiji GPU NM chip that combines highbandwidthmemory to give superior performance to a series of new AMD GPU products But here is Senior Vice President Raja Koduri explaining the huge advantages of the NM Polaris It has taken years to jump to NM from NM and for the first time puts them ahead of Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA in process node CERN The European Organization for Nuclear Research operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world To say they need the maximum computer power possible is to put it mildly CERN is considering the Zen processor with up to physical cores The point is not whether CERN will ultimately use Zen it is that CERN is even considering an AMD product at all The Zen specs must have impressed CERN otherwise why would they waste their valuable time I will admit the VR market is moving faster than I had anticipated Fortune magazine says VR market will grow from million in to billion in Compare that with AMDs revenue of less than billion and you can see the huge potential VR offers AMD And thats with high priced items like Oculus VR headset at Sales dollars will soar as prices come down over the next few years AMD is dominating the VR market right now with an market share including game consoles according to Jon Peddie Research And that is without the two new NM products Polaris for GPUs and Zen for CPUs AMD is concentrating on VR as outlined by Raja Koduri AMD continues to be a driving force in virtual reality Were bringing the technology to more people around the world through our efforts to expand the VR ecosystem with VR iCafs in China new Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets and a wide variety of content partners in gaming entertainment education science medicine journalism and several other exciting fields Recent rumors about the potential license deal between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD notwithstanding AMDs broad range of IP is an attractive asset for AMD shareholders If not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>then other potential licensees are out there waiting for a deal According to the company which is based in Sunnyvale California it is also working on monetizing its virtual reality VR IP as VR technology is expected to continue to grow exponentially in the industry In addition AMD also hopes to monetize its latest High Bandwidth Memory chip technology The company also recently introduced their new lineup of Radeon R series and its brand new Fury Lineup both of which they hope to monetize as well The good news surrounding AMDs product lines especially the Zen processor and VR continues to mount in spite of an ever decreasing cash balance The future looks extremely bright but the cash infusion from NantongFujitsu must come to fruition soon Assuming that deal closes in the nd quarter then it will be full steam ahead for Zen production and shipping this year Keeping in mind how small AMD is compared to competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>you can see how a relatively modest increase in sales and margins can have a huge effect on AMDs bottom line Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sells more in a month than AMD does in a year Taking just of Intels sales would increase AMDs sales by more than AMD has survived with inferior noncompetitive production metrics and once its products become more competitive or even superior to competition the results could be spectacular And that does not count sales from a potential Nintendo console deal or IP licensing or a new Sony VR chip for PlayStation I continue to rate AMD as a very strong buy but will change that to a sell if for some reason the NantongFujitsu deal fall through I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
