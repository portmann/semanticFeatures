Nvidia Corporation NASDAQ NVDA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQ INTC while enduring a slump in the PC market The company also suffered from market behavior by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that breached both antitrust and patent laws in the US and in the European Union After attaining a high of in March AMDs stock fell to a low of

augmented reality improved penetration of the regional data center server market new supply agreements with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY and Sony NYSE SNE for semi custom chips positive company guidance and two lucrative technology licensing deals in China see Why AMD Is Headed Higher The Radeon RX graphics card launched on June into the mainstream OEM market at an attention grabbing price of is to be followed by the still lower priced Radeon RX and RX cards on dates to be announced The RX comes complete with an overclocking software tool provided by AMD Radeon Wattman which has elicited favorable reviews The card is compatible with both Oculus Rift from Facebook Inc NASDAQ FB and HTC Corps Vive VR headsets and is available in GB and GB specifications When an initial issue of power draw by the RX arose AMD quickly addressed the problem with the speedy provision of the Radeon Software Crimson Edition driver in a manner that drew plaudits Amazoncom Inc NASDAQ AMZN Newegg Inc Best Buy Co Inc NYSE BBY and other retailers had to rapidly restock the RX after experiencing initial sellouts The RX sets a new bar for performance and smoothness at its price point and its undoubtedly the midrange card wed recommend to most AMDs sure kicked the Polaris GPU family off with a bang The Radeon RX is one hell of a graphics card one that redefines whats possible at affordable price points With successful market introduction bench testing and a keenly competitive price the RX is provoking strong interest from PC makers Lenovo Group Ltd OTCPKLNVGY Dell Inc and HP Inc NYSE HPQ There also are rumors gaining currency in the marketplace that Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL may supplement its existing use of AMD GPUs in top end Macs with the companys Polaris in the iMac and Polaris in the MacBook Pro Now as the announcement of second quarter results on July approaches the company for the first time in many years may consider new windows of corporate opportunity with recent developments having increased its range of strategic options The amount of cash AMD holds and the value of their shortterm investments declined from a combined billion in to million by the end of their fiscal year in December with total current assets declining from billion to billion over the same period High tech requires both high finance and liquidity for research and development manufacturing marketing and operating capital to sustain the cash flow lag endemic in the cycle of research product development and market introduction Having increased its share price by since July AMD will now have access to lower interest rate finance from investment banks through new or more favorable existing agreements secured by stock and from share issues that would not have been available to the company just months ago Gearing up for production of the coming RX and RX cards to claw back market share from Nvidia and for production of Zen server chips to combat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may prompt AMD to take such steps Establishing lower interest payments on existing financing as a result of higher share price will be an important consideration for a company with a currently high interest load The April joint venture licensing agreement achieved by AMD with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co will use the companys technology to develop server chips for marketing only in China This deal yielded AMD a million licensing fee and had already produced royalty payments of million by the end of April Royalty payments will continue to be a revenue stream for the company under this agreement In October AMD secured a joint venture agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co Ltd worth million whereby AMD contributed assembly and test management facilities This agreement has already produced a cash payout of million to AMD and will be another ongoing source of revenue The Tianjin Haiguang and Nantong Fujitsu deals created paradigms for AMD that they can seek to replicate in other markets Such ventures will be all the more attractive to prospective partners now that AMDs share price has increased so significantly There have already been unconfirmed reports of a GPU licensing deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Market Positioning Has Achieved Strong Brand Identity The successful launch of the RX high performance graphics card complete with the Radeon Wattman overclocking tool at a bargain price relative to Nvidias offerings has cemented a value brand identity for the company which may be capitalized upon by future product offerings The OEM GPU market is characterized by a plethora of techie websites which represent a discrete environment in which word of mouth referral and reputation is particularly important and is directly correlated with demand AMD is now well positioned to build upon their value brand identity going forward The company has projected a return to nonGAAP profitability in the second half Revenue from the RX launch and the Tianjin Haiguang and Nantong Fujitsu agreements will by then have ramped up A return to profitability when achieved will be a major financial way point for AMD During the second half AMD will be seeking to close the operating efficiency gap with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the data center processor market with their new Zen architecture on Samsung Electronic Cos nm FinFET finshaped field effect transistor node There is a receptivity to this development on the part of customers who seek better performance and competition in a market presently dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>As for second quarter results due shortly this quarter has historically been a relatively good one for the company In this calendar quarter AMD has won orders from Sony Microsoft and Nintendo for semi custom chips for game consoles in a segment which is the most profitable for AMD and which normally exhibits higher sales in the second and third quarters The companys comparatively low gross margins visavis its competitors will however be an ongoing challenge to which AMD must rise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia exhibit gross margins of between and AMD delivered a gross margin of in the first quarter of The company has given guidance that its operating expenses may increase in the second quarter by quarter on quarter to million and therefore operating margin is likely to be negatively impacted A positive counterpoint for the second quarter though is the possibility that the company may receive a payment of million from its joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu In this event positive free cash flow would then be maintained There are real grounds for optimism for AMD after a long period of struggle to return to profitability Very tangible progress has been made and the avenues by which that progress may be continued are clear It is in the second half of that the full benefit of recent developments should be felt Any view of the second quarter results soon to be announced should be reflective of this context If Q results trigger a temporary pullback in stock price then this will present a good opportunity to buy If you would care to follow this author and receive immediate alerts upon
