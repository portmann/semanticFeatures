Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>beat its million tablet application processor sales target in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can also sell or million smartphone processors this year ASUSTeK could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sell million or more smartphone processors this year The release of Windows could increase adoption of the Atom X SoC among budget smartphone vendors The mobile chips division of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC may still suffer operating losses well beyond this year However I appreciate the recent announcement that ASUSTeK OTCASUUY expects to ship million smartphones in This is almost double the original million estimate that ASUSTeK made last year This is a very important tailwind for INTC investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the exclusive supplier of smartphone application processors for Asus smartphones ASUSTeK expects the affordable ZenFone premium Android phone to be successful in China Asus has already shipped out million smartphones this first three months of Jonney Shih Chairman of ASUSTeK predicted that the China market could help his company ship out million more The Intelpowered ZenFone was introduced to China Taiwan and France last month Asus plans to offer this affordable highend phone to customers in India United States Hong Kong Russia Singapore Japan and Indonesia starting this month The GB RAMequipped ZenFone is cheaper than Xiaomis Mi OnePLus One and Googles NASDAQ GOOGL Nexus highend phones I therefore expect the Intelpowered ZenFone to attract millions of pricesensitive customers in China India Russia and Indonesia If Shih is confident that China could deliver million smartphones for ASUSTeK this year I am also confident that India Indonesia Russia and the United States could also help Asus ship out million more smartphones The emerging countries are the new growth drivers for smartphone sales The Intelpowered ZenFone is perfectly priced to win the middle class and semiaffluent consumers in India China and Indonesia According to GfK Asia India will be the top country with the best growth potential in smartphones The ZenFone has already received million preorders in China Yes Xiaomi is likely to continue to rule the highend Android smartphone sales in China However unless Xiaomi can lower the price tag of the Mi the ZenFone could seriously hurt the sales of Xiaomis flagship phone in India and Indonesia The price disparity between and Mi and the ZenFone is already huge savings for people in emerging countries Even a smart American would also appreciate the discount ASUSTeK would probably increase production of the ZenFone when it finds out that Chinese Aliexpress resellers are selling the ZenFone for to customers like me located in countries where the ZenFone is not yet available The ZenFone will only get launched in the Philippines on May My point is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>smartphone chips are finding their way in highermargin smartphones that are turning out to be a commercial success Consequently any contra revenue on ASUSTeKs exclusive use of Atom SoCs might be minimal My million estimate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>smartphone application processors this year is already realistic with ASUSTeKs own million smartphone shipment estimate for There will be other OEMs that will use the new Atom X SoC for their budget Android smartphones Intels partnership with Rockchip and investment in Spreadtrum could help Chinese whitebox smartphone vendors to shift from ARM to x mobile SoCs Unlike ARMbased SoCs from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and MediaTek x processors could flawlessly run Windows OS and PC softwaregames The overhead savings of using an x chip that works with all operating systems is pretty obvious ASUSTeK could easily create a Windows version of the ZenFone Android smartphone without having to negotiate with Qualcomm The aggressive pricing strategy of ASUSTeK is a longterm tailwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The success of the ZenFone proves that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has finally found the path toward success in smartphone application processors The issue of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT allowing Windows to run in ARMbased Android smartphones is NOT a deal breaker for Atom smartphone processors Unless other software giants like Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA Adobe NASDAQ ADBE and Autodesk port their xexclusive software to work on ARM architecture the Windows onARM proposition is still very limited Chinese smartphone vendors in Shenzhen will still want an Atom X LTEenabled SoC so they can save money They can use one x processor to create two smartphone versions or even create a dualboot Windowsandroid smartphone Chinese tech giant Huawei already made it clear last year that it is willing to sell dualOS smartphones The bit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom X could have the same energy efficiency of ARMbased Qualcomm or MediaTek SoCs It can run Windows Android Linux or any other operating systems and their respective apps The Atom X family is priced reasonably so that OEMs can use them even on sub Android or Windows smartphones Qualcomms latest entrylevel SoC the Snapdragon is not yet bit The Rockchipdesigned quadcore Atom XCRK plus GB of RAM is perfect for Windows or Android smartphones The upcoming ZenFone might just use an Atom X Xiaomis new budget or premium smartphone might just come with an Atom X Lenovos OTCPKLNVGY next Windows smartphone might just use an Atom X The enterprisecentric Lenovo P smartphone already uses the older bit Atom Z If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to sell million tablet SoCs last year theres a strong chance that it can also sell at least million smartphone processors this year Smartphone sales are far higher than tablets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now the No supplier of tablet application processors I look forward to <span

for INTC The contra revenue is a hammer that hurts Qualcomm and MediaTek they are losing OEM clients to Intels cheap multiOS GB RAMcapable Atom processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
