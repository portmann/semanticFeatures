positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Theres no way to call the Altera purchase cheap and shareholders have a right to ask questions about Intels historical deal execution That said under Krzanich <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to be taking a different approach they are transparent about past missteps and seemingly heading in the right direction now With the acquisition of Altera now officially closed its a time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC shareholders to reflect on the past as they look to the future Altera was not a cheap deal by any measure and Intels previous MA think McAfee hasnt exactly driven great shareholder returns That said managements strategic plan seems to make sense so Im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt rather than calling the price unjustifiable Before we get to Altera I think its worth noting the different tone under which this transaction took place There have been significant reorganizations at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since Krzanich took the reins ultimately concluding in the departure of multiple key executives Perhaps most notable was secondincommand Renee James the architect of the McAfee deal Recent commentary by Krzanich such as that at the Credit Suisse conference acknowledges shareholders right to be concerned over the Altera transaction specifically mentioning poor execution on McAfee Here and elsewhere Krzanich has been brutally honest about the companys historical failings for example he talked about the importance of paying more attention to IoT applications and how concerned he was when he discovered makers and researchers at universities in other words the future inventors of technology were working on ARM rather than x Recent scenario analyses presented by CFO Stacy Smith suggests that the company is now more realistic about the future of PCs a topic which both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management and bullish investors me included were consistently too optimistic about Some investors might view this as standard issue lets throw former management under the bus And perhaps theres some of this at play But I think the more important half of the equation is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management clearly doesnt have their head in the sand and the decisions theyre making are within the context of continued PC weakness as well as weak historical MA execution In other words theyre not glossing over the big questions theyre addressing them head on Anyway back to Altera While the companys original discussion noted that this would be accretive to FCF and nonGAAP EPS thats a bit facile because obviously deploying capital to purchase a profitable enterprise is going to increase FCF this is comparing returns to a baseline of zero what youre earning from cash in the bank even with the recent Fed decision Given relative valuations deploying B into share repurchases would likely have been equally if not more immediately accretive to numbers But this belies the potential strategic value of Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes that having firsttonode FPGAs will allow them to gain market share with cloud and other customers with specific workloads The longterm goal is really to continue to steal share from ASICs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already been selling Xeons into traditional ASIC applications for years of course but certain more specialized workloads would benefit from FPGAs copackaged with Xeons not to mention potential applications in the IoT group There should be both revenue and margin synergies over time along with the intangible value of continuing to eat more share in data centers and keep competitors grubby fingers out PostAcquisition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Not Cheap But Not Expensive Either Altera was a fairly large bite but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still looking to return to cashneutral by late demonstrating the strength of their cash flow generation That leaves the multiple seemingly fair without baking in any revenue or cost synergies from Altera Looking out its worth noting that with each passing year the relatively larger proportion of operating profit and revenue from DCG will help boost enterprisewide revenue growth and continued reduction of mobile losses and perhaps eventual profitability will help boost consolidated margins As Ive discussed previously Im not an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholder today for the simple reason that in the mids I dont believe the stock offers the sort of substantial excess return potential it did when it traded in the low s at which time I was a shareholder That said most people dont use a hurdle rate nearly as high as mine and I think the stock looks reasonable here in light of the broader market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to be tremendously cash flow generative management is cognizant of and transparent about the ongoing challenges in PCs and despite multiple years of promises by the ARM crowd we have yet to see Intels DCG dominance challenged by cheap ARM chips If I were running a diversified largecap mutual fund <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would probably be aboveweight capital returns will likely continue to be generous I believe disruption risk is lower than many investors assume and the longterm growth rate might be higher Thats not fantastic but in this market its seemingly enough to make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a decent long idea Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
