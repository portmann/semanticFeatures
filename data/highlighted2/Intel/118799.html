Alpha Intels EPS beat masked underlying declines in revenue and operating income Intels combining of the PC Client Group and the Mobile and Communications Group scarcely serves to conceal Intels huge mobile losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC initially wowed investors with a solid EPS beat of which pushed the stock up after hours After digesting the earnings release it becomes clear that the picture is not so rosy Intels operating income was actually down substantially nearly yy to billion while revenue was down yy to billion The EPS beat was an artifact of an abnormally low income tax provision for the quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is no longer a growth story despite the representations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management A post on zerohedgecom called this the Oldest Trick In The Accounting Book Its not clear how or why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to lower its provision for taxes line item from the year ago quarters amount of billion to just million for this quarter Perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had overpaid in previous quarters Whatever the explanation the impact was to camouflage the steep income decline On the conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management gave the impression that Data Center Group and Internet of Things Group were both growing robustly Revenues for the groups were up modestly yy for DCG f or IoTG Operating income was flat yearoveryear for both groups The lack of operating income growth is a direct consequence of the pressure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>faces from lower cost and lower power ARM processor options in both the Data Center and IoT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will fight hard to hold on to its market share probably making it difficult or impossible for ARM processor vendors to turn profits in these categories Income growth will stall or even decline but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors can take some comfort in the fact that Intels competitors are hurting more Impact of Mobile Device Consolidation The Client Computing Group formed from consolidating the PC Client Group PCCG and the Mobile and Communications Group beginning this year continued to be the main culprit behind the operating income decline This can be seen in the chart below in which I compare PCCG revenue and operating income in with CCG for using Intels SEC filings Note that these are comparisons to the original PCCG results as reported in not the CCG restated results for Compared to last year CCG revenue has been down in both Q and Q The revenue decline may be attributable to the overall decline in the PC market but MCG did post negative revenue of million in Q so consolidation with MCG probably hasnt helped revenue While the revenue situation is somewhat ambiguous the operating income situation is not The declines in operating income are largely attributable to MCG which was posting billion losses for most quarters last year The delta for Q is particularly bad a little over billion Another way to look at this is the effect on operating margin of the consolidation with MCG In the chart below I show the operating margins for the PCCG and CCG for the first two quarters of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management claimed on the conference call yesterday to be on track to meet their goal of million in cost reductions for the mobile business Its hard to discern any progress from these results If anything the results imply that the losses due to mobile devices are only getting worse with about billion being scooped off the top of the combined groups operating income Once again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stated in their earnings release that it had sold million tablet processors It appears however that this was once again only by virtue of contra revenue subsidies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acknowledged on the conference call that contra revenue is still going on but claimed that SoFIA was helping to reduce that The advent of SoFIA now Atom X was supposed to help reduce the impact of contra revenue and trim losses However the delay into the first half of of SoFIA LTE means that Intels Atom X G offerings are really not competitive except in developing markets These are not markets in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to make a lot of money with the X When asked during QA when SoFIA manufacturing would be brought in house <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acknowledged that even next years SoFIA LTE would continue to be manufactured outside presumably by TSMC NYSE TSM The inhouse version of SoFIA at nm wont come on line until H This puts the premium smartphone market completely out of reach until next year at the earliest And that market isnt standing still Apple NASDAQ AAPL for instance will be on their th generation bit SOC by the fall of also manufactured on a nm Samsung OTC SSNLF or TSMC node <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>argues with some justification that it still maintains process leadership This is probably true but not as much as when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was the only company in the world to have FinFET transistors in mass production The ability of the ARM foundries to implement their own FinFET processes laid to rest the myth that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had an insuperable process lead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>claims that they will maintain that lead With the advent of Samsungs nm FinFET process already in production for its own Exynos processor in the Galaxy S that lead shrank appreciably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also announced that it was going to put off the next major process node nm until thus breaking its historic twoyear cycle on process node development This is a measure of the difficulty of continuing to shrink process sizes using existing lithography techniques Its also likely a measure of a somewhat slower pace in achieving the yield on nm that typified previous nodes Likely the industry will follow suit There was probably a collective sigh of relief at Samsung and TSMC when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made the announcement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made the decision based on the cost benefit of moving to the new node in According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the cost benefit of maintaining the twoyear cycle just wasnt going to be there for nm Going slow also allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to absorb more losses in mobile giving it more time to make the contra revenue strategy work As one analyst pointed out during QA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has probably lost the opportunity to jump out ahead or even further ahead of the rest of the industry on nm While Samsung and TSMC would have been hard pressed to make nm in is probably well within their comfort zone Intels process leadership will only diminish as a result of its decision on nm As of the Q earnings report I was still willing to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management the benefit of the doubt on their mobile strategy and the consolidation of PCCG and MCG I wrote Its still hard for me to believe that any American corporate management could be so obtuse as to think that the elementary subterfuge of a reorganization could work to conceal losses So Im still inclined to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the benefit of the doubt and assume that mobile losses will be brought under control rather than merely disguised That clearly hasnt happened and Im through giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management the benefit of the doubt They really are that obtuse They should be removed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is desperately in need of regime change Intels response to the mobile device revolution and the dominance of that revolution by ARM processors is analogous to the response of BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY to the introduction of Apples iPhone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>keeps insisting that people really want <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture x in their mobile devices just as BlackBerry kept insisting the people really want physical keyboards on their smartphones BlackBerrys dominance of the market at the time kept them from seeing the future just as Intels dominance of the PC market has kept it from seeing the future Just as BlackBerry could have benefited from a fresh outlook back in when there was still an opportunity to address the competitive challenge posed by iPhone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could benefit from a fresh outlook now Failing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has become a short opportunity The ingredients are all there A management out of touch with reality A company that is shrinking rather than growing and doesnt understand why A base of investorfans clinging to an image of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
