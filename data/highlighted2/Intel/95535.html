class='textDiv'>Apple And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>A Marriage Made In PCode <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Apples decision to require bitcode on WatchOS opens the door to processor independence An Apple move to make bitcode mandatory for iOS apps would open the door for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to win the foundry business for the next generation of iPhone and iPad processors The jury is still out on whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is ready or willing to do what it takes to win the business One of the ongoing hot discussions that has roiled the combined Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC investing community from time to time is the possibility that Intels Foundry Division could land Apples iOSbased processor business The logic of the deal from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors standpoint seems rocksolid and goes something like this An <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>foundry win of the Apple SOC business would help validate x as a winning mobile SOC architecture Apple is the premier brand in the mobile ecosystem with the bulk of the industry profits and enough unit share roughly to represent a worthwhile target for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Success with Apple in the mobile market will provide a profitable foundation for continuing innovation in lowpower SOC technology that can provide a springboard for inroads into the IoT market Apples highend design focus is ideally suited to utilize Intels industryleading FinFet process technology Apple all being equal would like not to utilize its competitor Samsung OTCSSNLF for its foundry services TSMC NYSE TSM while formidable may not be able to afford the level of innovation in advanced chip design that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can and thus represents a poor second option for Apple Mix all these ingredients together and voila we have a match made in heaven for both Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders The classic winwin Apple gets the best technology and the brand leverage that goes with it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wins on many levels At the cost of reduced margins Intels foundry business has momentum and critical mass its revenue and bottom line get a big boost and shareholders rejoice to see significant EPS gains Whats not to like So here we are in mid and still no deal What happened Can anything still happen Despite all the rhetoric on these SA boards and in other publications we have to conclude at this point that more heat than light has been generated by the topic The problem Candidly as much as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fans might think it was a great idea all their speculation was totally untethered to any verifiable expression of interest on Apples part In a recent article in AppleInsider author Daniel Eran Diger explored the beginnings of the fractured relationship between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Apple In speaking of Otellini However while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was interested in selling its new Core x chips to Apple for use in Macs and developing the supporting chipsets for them it wasnt interested in building mobile chips for Apples iPhone at least not at the price Apple wanted to pay and in the quantity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expected Apple to buy Intels former chief executive Paul Otellini revealed last year that he didnt believe his company would able to earn enough money building mobile chips for Apples new iPhone to cover its development costs largely because he couldnt imagine Apple selling iPhones in large quantities Well you win some and you lose some right Since then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has lost billions trying to gain a foothold in the mobile business and still trails Qualcomm with its Atom offerings Apple did throw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a bone with its Mac business worth m units today but other than that has gone its own way And what a way that has been With the growth of the iPhone over the years since Apple has built and developed worldclass expertise in ARM architecture SOC design with its Aseries of processors Just recently the company extended that franchise with the S chip that powers the Apple Watch Otellinis failure to see the potential for large quantities of Apple SOCs back in is now off by more than million in The total potential worth of this processor business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains to be seen but at the least it is highsingledigit billions Perhaps even more important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>than the profit from the contract is the competitive value of taking it away from Samsung and TSMC Whatever Intels motivation and capability there remains the issue of whether Apple has any interest in giving it to them The riskreward ratio at this stage looks daunting for Apple After all there are hundreds of millions of customers using million apps in the Apple App store all of them written to an ARM architecture CPU of Apples design and all of them using compilers that generate binary that only works on ARMarchitecture processors If Apple were to move these apps to a system foundation based on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x instruction set the operational risk would be massive As it stands right now all the applications would have to be recompiled retested and resubmitted Beyond that the brilliant team of designers at Apple who have mastered the ARM instruction set and gone beyond generic ARM core facilities to design their own cores would have to learn whats in effect a new language x for their chip design How long would that learning curve be Lets assume Apple can get beyond those concerns Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>really ready for the foundry business prime time Is its heart really in it Can Apple trust <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to deliver or will Apples business always be at the mercy of other higher data center priorities for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Dont forget Otellini may have had it wrong big time in the volume category but he was right on about the relative price and profitability to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Instead of selling a Core I for a Mac at a rumored price of roughly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would be doing well to get for the SOCs coming out of the foundry Current rumors have them at a cost of for the A processors from TSMC From a corporate gross margin goal of it would be fortunate to achieve And what if something went wrong Right now Apple has TSMC and Global Foundries for second sourcing Samsung Would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>allow a second source for their prized FinFet nm process On the other hand this isnt Apples first rodeo Remember PowerPC Apple transitioned off that hardware architecture and very successfully Moreover Apple has to be concerned about the potential of being trapped in an architecture that has run out of steam And then theres this issue beyond technical capability and thats business viability Dont ever forget that we are talking about immense and rapidly increasing CapEx investments to stay in the uberprocessor game How big are the investments we are talking about Samsung just invested billion in their latest Fab and while some of it will be dedicated to DRAM and NAND production most of it is rumored to go to logic fabrication Indeed one of the arguments being advanced today by chip makers and analysts is that with the slowing of Moores Law theres a need to invest in increasing amounts of CapEx for decreasing returns with each new bleedingedge node So much so that only a downstream business with unit volumes in the hundreds of millions can possibly justify it We know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Samsung will be around for bigtime SOC fabrication will TSMC Apple has to be concerned that it may be rapidly approaching a time where it has to choose one partner and stay with it come good or ill Would it really want that partner to be its arch competitor Samsung There is a good reason Apple is not in any hurry to jump into bed with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>There may be a reason in the relatively near future Doing the groundwork to make the move to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x will take time All this preceding is meant to provide a little background for a recent Sunday June discussion by the panel of MacBreak Weekly that was focused on Apples WWDC Worldwide Developers Conference announcements The participants Aaron Hillegass AH Big Nerd Ranch Leo Laporte LL host of MacBreak Weekly and Jason Snell SixColorscom I quote it at length because I think the arc of the conversation captures well the surprise and potential import of the information AH Let me point out one more data point which is byte code So one of the things youll submit to the App Store is now this intermediate representation not fully compiled down to machine code AH A pcode sort of thing and the idea is that then in the future Apple can ship whatever kind of processor they want LP Wait a second here slow down captain Do you mean that if I am going to submit something to the app store I have to submit it as binary fully compiled code and as intermediate pcode even though theres no use for that bytecode at this point Is that true for all apps AH So they can swap processors out from under JS It could mean running apps on Mac AH Yeah running IoS Apps on Mac LP Wow I didnt know that When did they start doing this AH It was just announced yesterday Theres app thinning You remember how you used to delete all of those libraries so you could update your iPhone to iOS Well it was a GB download now its about a Gigabyte download And the way they are doing it is called app thinning So right now your app in that it has support for a lot of different architectures in it bit bit and the like Well now it can strip out the parts it doesnt need and bring down the thin app LL This intermediate byte code thing could be huge I dont think anybody has reported on it Its huge Really significant meaning Theres something going there Apple wouldnt require it if The fact that they are requiring it NOW is I think telling Interesting JS They never want to be caught flatfooted again to feel like oh no were falling behind and were tied to this platform They want to be agile Hmm Remember our list of impediments to any potential switch This new requirement for developers could check box one Lets spend some time and get to the bottom of this First off lets put the terminology in context As we talk about this youll see three terms all of which mean basically the same thing Theres bytecode pcode and then theres the term that Apple uses which is bitcode All of them refer to a software entity which sits between the high level code that the developer is using to implement the app say Swift or Objective C that compiles that code into a virtual machine language thats independent of hardware and that then can be compiled again by another program to allow potentially any physical machine to run the app Bottom line if you are Apple and dont want to be in a position that ties the company to a specific hardware platform pcode is the way to do that Freedom agility leverage all these wonderful attributes flow from that P word Hallelujah hallelujah free at last free at last Give me your tired poor your apps yearning to be free This is from an Owen Williams piece in TNW in which he interviews Apple developer on the import of pcode He the Apple developer believes that if Apple suddenly switched to an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chip in the next iPhone for example it would require no work on his end to have his apps running on day one Is that cool or what Before we get too excited lets take a moment and actually verify that this requirement for bitcode submission is Apples official stance Heres the quote from the Apple Development Manual Bitcode is an intermediate representation of a compiled program Apps you upload to iTunes Connect that contain bitcode will be compiled and linked on the App Store Including bitcode will allow Apple to reoptimize your app binary in the future without the need to submit a new version of your app to the store Note For iOS apps bitcode is the default but optional If you provide bitcode all apps and frameworks in the app bundle need to include bitcode For watchOS apps bitcode is required OK Turns out iOS apps are not yet in play Required for watchOS apps default but optional for the iPhone and iPad apps on iOS Why the distinction Whatever the reason the default but language surely is a powerful incentive for developers to take the hint and submit bitcode Owen Williams writing on this topic for TNW speculates that theres some evidence that an outright requirement for OS X is in the offing Theres one sticking point as far as we know bitcode isnt being supported for OS X apps yet though we shouldnt disregard that Wendker the person who announced the technology at WWDC works on the OS X team Netting this out it certainly appears that something is afoot and that it could have tremendous import for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the relatively near future I highly recommend Williams article if you want to learn more about the potential impact of bitcode on developers but for now lets move on to the potential implications for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Apple First off all investors should know that this might not turn out well for Mother <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Requiring apps to be submitted in Pcode is truly a walk down a forked road As Williams speculates its quite possible that the first move Apple would make with its newfound freedom is to move FROM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to their own proprietary ARM processor for the Mac Thats a loss of roughly million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors per year at an average of cost per chip thats a cool B in revenue maybe half of that in gross margin which would result in roughly a share hit Ouch On the other hand if Apple proceeds down the other fork theres now a real opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to make the foundry sale of the new century Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>pull it off Who the heck knows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has certainly shown no particular competence in the foundry business and many analysts still dont believe they know what they are doing Maybe the size of the prize would concentrate their mind Apple is projected to sell about million iPhones this year and million iPads If we go with an estimate of million Apple Watches this year the total comes to about million total Apple SOCs While unit growth is slowing in the smartphone business Apple recently has been gaining share and will probably sell more units next year and the year after that Lets round it to m a year in and estimate a processor in average price to Apple Thats B in revenue and even at a sacrificial gross margin rate say that much additional gross margin bumps the EPS needle share Compare this with the total of share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>booked last year Whatever the odds on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gaining the business what would Apple get out of the deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>of course touts their process prowess Heres an Anandtech analysis from August of last year Citing thirdparty journal articles for comparison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>claims that along with their typical lead in rolling out new nodes as of the nm node they are going to have a multiple generation technical advantage They expect that their nm node will offer significantly smaller feature sizes than competing nm nodes allowing them to maintain consistent logic area scaling at a time when their competitors ie TSMC cannot In the same article they evaluate the claim Thus for what its worth the basic facts do appear to check out but we would be the first to point out that there is more to semiconductor manufacturing than just logic area scaling At least until Intels competitors start shipping their FinFET products this is going to be speculative and doesnt quantify how well those competing process nodes will perform But then again the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is already on their second FinFET node when their competitors are still ramping up their first is no small feat Since then of course Samsung has announced a nmprocess win for this falls Apple A most probably to be produced in their Austin fab and then in April they announced their nm process which is rumored to be going into next years S series phone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand is remaining silent on their nm plans and schedule though we certainly expect to hear more at their November Developers conference at the latest What are we to think of all this back and forth claim and counter claim of process supremacy For what its worth most technical experts give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the clear edge For investors all these vendor announcements and assertions are shrouded in the everpresent fog of war that envelops this fiendishly complex expensive and riskridden technology The only thing we know for sure is that technical superiority is not by itself a sufficient reason for Apple to choose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Lets wrap this up Right now only the watch apps have the bitcode submission requirement Bitcode for iOS apps is default but optional Mac OS doesnt yet support bitcode In order for an Apple decision to move the iPhone and iPad business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to be feasible bitcode must become mandatory for iOS apps In order for it to be feasible for Apple to move away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the Mac bitcode must become a Mac OS facility and Mac developers must be required to make their apps bitcode compliant Will Apple do this If they do can the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>foundry win the Apple iOS processor business Will it avoid losing the Mac business The only thing we know for sure is that with the pcode submission requirement for app developers the business can be in play Well be waiting and watching for Apple policy to change regarding iOS and Mac OS Personally I have no doubt that the policy will change because it is so obviously in Apples interest to do it Source Apple And <span
