Verizon has announced Hum and ThingSpace to lower the cost of connecting things to the Internet Dell has the connected cow to make IoT relatable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides more than just the chips to make all of this possible and will reveal their latest IoT Insights on November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has been working on developing IP and products for the IoT Internet of Things for many years with the idea that they do not want to miss this next huge growth area which companies like DHL and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO have estimated to be billion things by These companies estimate that IoT will deliver a trillion boost to supply chain and logistics operations While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will sell chips to go into Things their biggest financial benefit will come from sales of processors for gateway devices to collect data at the edge and data centers needed to storeprocessanalyze the data from billion Things so that personal computing devices can connect humans to the useful Big Data analytics Note that the chips in Things onsite gateways and onsite processor chips are part of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IoTG while the processors in data centers are part of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>DCG One of the factors holding IoT back has been the cost of connecting limited use devices to the Internet Verizon NYSE VZ has recognized this and recently announced programs to connect cars at a lower cost Hum and to provide a variety of data connection plans for various types of devices and usage ThingSpace ThingSpace will encourage more IoT devices by providing flexible data plans for Things that are connected to the Internet This will likely lead to other Internet service providers offering similar packages and ultimately grow the IoT business While many connected products rely on WiFi or Bluetooth and then use the customers mobile phone for any mobile connectivity there are entire classes of devices such as dog trackers luggage trackers and automotive applications that would benefit from an alwayson cellular connection But the added cost of a cellular subscription can make the final price of the device untenable for the consumer or even corporate market Which is why Verizons plan to offer flexibility on new data plans for Things is important This is one area where smaller developers and larger corporate customers have been begging telecommunications companies for flexibility for years Now that Verizon has opened the door other data service providers such as ATT NYSE T Sprint NYSE S and TMobile NASDAQ TMUS will likely follow providing a huge boost to the IoT Industry Dell has worked closely with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at all levels from Things to gateways at the edge to data centers and to PCs that provide a working useful and secure platform for IoT To make IoT more personal Dell has talked about their connected cow program Kirsten Billhardt Marketing Strategist for the Internet of Things at Dell says that Changing the conversation to something as friendly and accessible as cows has changed everything Now there are smiles and a real interest to hear more I can sketch out the story pretty quickly I share how there is a dairy farm Chitale Dairy in India that was having a problem with low milk yields So they tagged the animals with radiofrequency identification RFID tags I leave out this part that when scanned transmits unique information on each cow back to the data center Farmers can use their mobile phones to pull up information on each animal and use this to better treat each individual cow Chitale Dairy now has a complete endtoend cows to cloud strategy in place Vishvas Chitale Director Chitale Dairy says Weve transformed our dairy operations using technology and the feeding and breeding of animals is now monitored by computers By automating the collection of data from each farm we have improved animal health leading to increased milk yield per animal Weve also streamlined the efficiency of our distribution channels for faster delivery of our milk products to consumers On November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will hold its third annual IoT Insights In the past this IoT Insights day has been filled with valuable data regarding what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing in the IoT space Most of it has focused on examples like saving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by connecting sensors in a building and doing things like adjusting HVAC based on the number of people in various parts of the building and programs in the RD space like harvesting power from the area around the Things to power the electronic device collecting and transmitting data In the past Brian Krzanich <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO has been absent from these IoT Insights presentations On November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>appears to be pulling out all the stops with Brian leading the presentations and all of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>big hitters including Diane Bryant VP Data Center Group Doug Davis VP Internet of Things Group Doug Fisher VP Software and Services Group Josh Walden VP New Technology Group and Chris Young VP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security Group will be presenting I will be watching to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the IoT space is shaping a wide breadth of industries I expect to hear about many realworld deployments across the globe I also expect to hear announcements about new IoT technology from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that will be introduced in the near term Finally I expect to hear about research <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing to make IoT more convenient and useful in the future The most important aspect to investors may be the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>technology announcements that may be made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>keeps these announcements close to the vest prior to making them but I expect to hear about technology and programs that will increase the attractiveness easeofuse usefulness practicality and security of connected Things For background lets review Intels IoT Group revenues and profits The revenue and operating income for the IOTG operating segment for the third quarter of compared to the third quarter of were as shown in the top chart below Net revenue for the IOTG operating segment increased by million or in Q compared to Q Net revenue grew from to and from to seems like a reasonable expectation going forward If we use an annual growth rate of the revenues will grow to billion in While this will not dramatically move Intels overall earnings every contributing profit helps Keep in mind that Intels IoTG includes platforms designed for embedded market segments such as retail transportation industrial buildings and home As such it includes chips for Things chips for gateways at the edge to connect Things to data centers However it does not include the data center that benefits from growth in the IoT Data generated by Things will go through be stored in and analyzed by data centers with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors SSDs communications devices and soon D Xpoint DIMMs The biggest benefit I see associated with IoT for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the near term is an increase in the shine associated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock With the market understanding that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making good progress at the leading edge of the huge IoT industry along with other emerging growth areas the market will run up the price to earnings ratio from the current to the that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had late last year A PE ratio of would move <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>from the current to Please see my article on emerging growth trends for discussion of other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>growth areas that will contribute to Intels shine and PE increase to We only use your contact details to reply to your request
