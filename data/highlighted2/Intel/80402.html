<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will return investors this year I disagree with the traditional pricing model After modeling various scenarios I have an EPS range of to and believe that volatility will creep up in the back half of the year The stock price could potentially swing from to as market expectations could change drastically on a quarter by quarter basis After weighing both positives and negatives I have conviction that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will at least reach by the end of the calendar year While the sky might not be falling on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC the share price surely is Following the close of the Altera NASDAQ ALTR deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>underperformed the broader market and fell by more than Like many I found myself scratching my head But thats okay because over the longterm the company can justify the premium it paid to buyout Altera by increasing prices across its serverclass CPUs CoCPUs and FPGAs While the company didnt mention the significant cost synergies from the deal in an intelligible manner the added volume will improve the cost structure for operating more expensive fabs as operating at more advanced nodes will require disruptive changes in lithography materials and design going forward This increases costs so to mitigate the impact the next step is to create opportunities to drive significant wafer volumes Therefore the acquisition of Altera may prove helpful over the long haul Now according to economic theory the best way to maximize profitability is to be the only major provider of a product or service In our case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>operates a natural monopoly by erecting both artificial and competitive barriers to market entry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>holds the patents to various technologies pertaining to the X instruction set and has enough RD resources to compete on two major fronts fabs and chips Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can sell at higher price points which will reduce volume so that pricing elasticity is maximized to the benefit of the supplier and not the purchaser Now Im not a huge proponent of using CAPM for predicting stock prices as its not always an accurate forward indicator of expected returns After inputting the expected returns for the stock market year treasury yields and Intels fiveyear beta into my CAPM Model the expected return is The stock has done much worse than that this year So to add emphasis CAPM isnt always an accurate forward indicator but its nice to compare the yeartodate performance against the expected return of the security I disagree with the expected return in this specific case The reason Beta captures volatility on a per day basis and doesnt measure delta in context of monthly or yearly inputs The average volatility per day over a series of time is different from the cumulative return of a stock in comparison to the index In many cases I have seen a stock continuously increase in value but at a lower rate of volatility when averaged over a period of months or years In cases like that a stock exhibits low volatility yet produces a higher rate of return than the expected return Generating alpha comes from foresight an ability that humans have learned to develop via various abstract forms of logic If you do something a certain outcome will occur When studying economics and finance I have often found that the quality of a business could easily be determined by the durability of earnings the growth trajectory and its relative valuation Now when you combine all three of these factors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is an easy investment case to make By the end of the year I anticipate the company to surprise both on gross margins and revenue Sure the upgrade cycle might not result in a stunning rate of growth but it doesnt need to The DCG needs to sustain a high enough of a growth rate to offset the impact from lower performing categories Ive modeled various scenarios and I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will report an adjusted earnings figure that excludes the shortterm charges from the Altera acquisition I anticipate two scenarios The scenario where Intels PCCG generates growth and the scenario where PCCG reports contraction Now in the bestcase scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reports EPS of and trades at The worstcase scenario is EPS of which would drag my price projection down to I think that the stock will stay within a low to low range After factoring in the impact from the Altera acquisition my bias is leaning toward EPS of or more This is because the acquisition of Altera generates enough meaningful revenue and net income accretion to offset a reduction in PCCG revenue Furthermore the net profit margin should improve by at least a hundred basis points on the back of falling mobile subsidies and the integration of a higher margin FPGA business Investors should anticipate the back half of the year to swing from wildly negative back into wildly positive territory This implies that the stock should be bought on the recent pullback as results will be backhalf weighted due to the seasonal nature of PCs and mobile devices Im going to lower my price target from to However I continue to reiterate my buy rating on the stock While I acknowledge the confusion that has surfaced from the acquisition of Altera the stock has reasonable upside even after factoring in a yearoveryear decline of in PCCG and the integration of a bolton acquisition Source <span
