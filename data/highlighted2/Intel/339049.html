class='textDiv'>Apple Moving On After The Taiwan Earthquake Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha The Taiwan earthquake affected TSMC production in particular the FAB that produces the Apple A Samsung has lost the A partial commission due to weak results compared to the TSMC product The Taiwanese issue may push Apple to get back on track to differentiate the application processor production in order to avoid possible future delays Apple may seriously consider to entrust the production to Samsung and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The latter one has probably won a partial modem production for iPhone Samsung and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may gain from this apparently small issue while Apple may build up its hardware ecosystem and drive down hardware costs For TSMC NYSE TSM foundries things initially did not look bad at all since the company stated that of the business would have been back to normal within days However things are different from the first reports and Apple NASDAQ AAPL may be forced to change its supply strategy favoring companies like Samsung OTCSSNLF and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Some hours after the earthquake TSMC declared the event did not affect its production in any major way and that AP production would have been back on track within days Obviously given such a situation there was no major concern about AP production and Apple supply for the iPhone Further reportss in the mid of February sounded quite different almost like an alarm bell TSMC said it expects to meet its previous shipments and revenue target but it has also said that next quarter shipments will be affected more than of production and that the damage affecting FAB is worse than expected FAB is the fab producing the Apple SoCs and that is the main alarm bell But I will get there later TSMC also is ready to roughly double its nm production increasing the wafer production capacity from k units in February to k units in March This projection is consistent with previous roadmaps that state TSMC would have increased nm share from to of its production The nm production would comprise the FF FinFET the FF FinFET Plus and the FFC FinFET Compact process node These technologies will be used for various customers such as Apple Xilinx Mediatek HiSilicon Spreadstrum and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA For Apple TSMC is very likely the sole AP supplier for the next upcoming iPhone powered by the future Apple A SoC That is where the recent earthquake could bring different paths Apple generally prefers to have different suppliers in order to avoid possible supply issues and to avoid annoying delays in device distribution But this approach could bring up different issues it is possible that the same AP design produced by different companies may lead to slightly different performances and possible complaints from consumers Thats what has happened with the Apple A produced by TSMC and Samsung After last years complaints Apple decided to entrust the entire A production to TSMC but we have seen that having a sole supplier may be a great risk and it has its limits against nature or worldwide dynamics Apple has a lot of feasible paths to take after the earthquake The Cupertino company may decide to get back to last year and to entrust part of the A production to Samsung which looks to have FABs in safer positions and it has managed to win the Snapdragon production against TSMC It also may decide to entrust the entire production to Samsung but this business move is unlikely to happen because it would mean having a sole supplier It may decide to entrust part of the production to Samsung and to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since the latter one looks to have won of the modem production for iPhone and probably iPhone SE This could be problematic because TSMCSamsung nm and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm process nodes are quite different with the latter one being consistently denser this would likely imply more problematic complaints than last year It also may decide to entrust the entire production to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>While it would be a single producer Apple would be able to exploit a denser and advanced process node In any case the chance that Apple will change its strategy is not foreign at all and the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has probably won part of the modem production for iPhone it may be a consistent hint Apple also may exploit such an event to drive down the price per unit It has already been reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was working hard on building a modem for future iPhones and I have already discussed such matter Since people working on it have been stated to be around the chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to also win the Apple SoC design is more sensible and feasible now Such a move would provide more supply stability and the chance to drive down the price per unit once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>becomes a feasible contractor At the same time Samsung and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would meet a revenue and profit increase On the contrary TSMC and Qualcomm are the players with potential losses Qualcomm would meet a consistent revenue decrease from the modem market while TSMC would be hit twice by losing a big customer as Apple and by the production reduction for Qualcomm since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is likely beginning to substitute Qualcomms modems inside Apple devices From this scenario Apple may reach multiple targets it will certainly reach a cost reduction for the AP units since Intels presence will add additional pressure on TSMC and Samsung The same target may be reached for the modems since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would add pressure on Qualcomm and Murata If Apple will entrust the AP production to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>it will probably have a better performing SoC with the same base design the LG Nuclun preview showed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>design at nm was consistently faster than TSMC product with the same TDP and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm is likely to maintain the lead Finally since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is using people to design the modem requested by Apple it is very likely to be a custom modem modeled to be effective with Apple APs and its platform The latter one would be a typical approach for Apple Disclosure
