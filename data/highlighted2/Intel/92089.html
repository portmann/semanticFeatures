class='textDiv'>Apple What Is The Future Of The Mac Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha A recent WSJ article suggested that the Mac has become an unnecessary distraction for Apple While I disagree with this premise I do believe that Apple needs to articulate its vision for the future of the Mac The recent WSJ article Why Apple Should Kill Off the Mac was misguided and failed to ask the really important question about the Mac let alone try to answer it In this article Ill try to outline what I believe is the likely future of the Mac Although I dont subscribe to the heresy of the WSJ article I have some heresies of my own to put forth which many Apple NASDAQ AAPL fans may find no less bitter By now most Apple fans and investors have read or at least heard of the Christopher Mims article WSJ subscription required at link I wont bother addressing its shortcomings as Macworld has already done a great job of that But the article did stimulate my thinking about the larger issue of what the role of the Mac will be in the future as smartphones and tablets become the main focus of personal computing After thinking about it I realized that Apple hadnt articulated a vision of the future for the Mac This will probably be regarded as heresy number one but when does Apple ever talk about the future of its products Rarely if ever Year after year Apple previews its upcoming OS releases at WWDC but its always this years model Never does Apple articulate a vision for the future beyond the current event horizon Each years version of iOS and Mac OS is an evolution of the previous year The only inference to be drawn from WWDC is that the Mac will simply continue The closest that Apple has come to articulating a vision for the PC and especially the Mac has come by way of reaction to Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Windows In Windows Microsoft articulated a vision of the future of personal computing as a convergence of the tablet and traditional desktoplaptop form factors Apples reaction can be summarized in CEO Tim Cooks dismissive anything can be forced to converge comment Which brings me to what many will regard as my foremost heresy At least Microsoft has articulated a vision for the PC a vision that they continue to pursue with Windows All weve ever gotten from Apple is Mac OS status quo plus this years upgrades I submit that this is no longer enough Apples dismissal of Microsofts attempts at PCtabletphone convergence contains no small amount of irony iOS and now watchOS are built upon Mac OS X This is the fundamental reason why the suggestion of Mims is so ludicrous Its also the fundamental reason why Apples dismissal of Microsofts convergence is disingenuous There really arent three different operating systems Theres just AppleOS tailored for three different form factors and platforms Okay Im glossing over many important differences between the operating systems Im sure there will be many comments taking me to task for this Let my just try to preempt those comments a little by noting that Im not oblivious to the differences its just that enumerating them is beyond the scope of a nontechnical article on Seeking Alpha My point here is that there has been a steady march toward convergence of iOS and Mac OS X since the introduction of the iPad It isnt just in look and feel that the operating systems have become more alike Fundamental OS X technologies such as sandboxed apps the App store full screen mode are all borrowed from iOS This year at WWDC we saw the simultaneous introduction of split screen mode for iOS and Mac OS X Increasingly the convergence is occurring in tandem rather than sequentially Even in the most fundamental UI difference between iOS and Mac OS X we began to see the beginnings of a final merging of the operating systems One of the key differences between iOS and Mac OS X has been in basic pointing and selection Mac OS X uses mouse and track pad iOS uses a touch screen East is East and West is West and as far as Apple was concerned never the twain shall meet Up until this year At this years WWDC we saw the introduction of a true cursor to iOS in the form of a keyboard mode that emulates a track pad and allows the user to manipulate a text cursor on the screen Even though Android has had the ability to switch back and forth between cursor and touch this was a big conceptual step for Apple if not a big technical step So if East is meeting West if iOS is gradually becoming more like Mac OS X and vice versa whats the point of maintaining them as separate operating systems For a long time the simple answer was that the operating systems target and were tailored to different platforms iOS ran on ARMbased touch screen devices Mac OS X ran on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>based traditional desktops and laptops That separation still makes sense for the time being but it breaks down in the not too distant future Apples next generation of iOS devices will be the most capable ever based on what we can reasonably expect in computational power from Apples next generation custom ARM architecture systems on chip SOCs which power all iOS devices Apples custom SOCs are rapidly outgrowing the constraints of iOS which was originally designed to run on much less capable processors with severe memory compute speed and storage constraints With the growing compute capability of Apples SOCs the separation based on target processor is becoming a needlessly selfimposed limitation Ive proposed in the past another heresy that continues to rankle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fans that Apple could run Mac OS X on its own ARM architecture SOCs rather than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Such ARM based Macs would be less expensive than their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>counterparts would run cooler and have greater battery life and most importantly would be less expensive by virtue of the less expensive ARM SOC Such ARM based Macs would only run Mac OS App Store apps since developers would be able to easily convert any App Store app for use on ARM architecture But Apples Mac App store is growing rapidly and I doubt that this would be perceived as an important limitation by most Apple customers If processor architecture no longer constitutes a sufficient barrier between iOS and Mac OS we have to once again ask ourselves whats the point of separate operating systems This brings me to my final heresy Microsoft has probably answered this question there is no point Microsofts vision of the PC future articulated at the time Windows was released in late may well have been ahead of its time and certainly was ahead of Microsofts ability to execute But I believe it was the correct vision in the long run All of us Microsoft and Apple fans alike are moving into this converged future If Windows succeeds we may well conclude that weve arrived at this future If it doesnt then that future is still some ways off Mims misdiagnosed what is holding Apple back He thought it was clinging to the Mac Thats not what is holding Apple back at all What is holding Apple back is its parochial notinventedhere attitude towards a phenomenon of convergence that it is itself facilitating To some degree the rejection of convergence at Apple may have by now merely devolved into a pretense The leadership of Apple is very smart and Im sure they see the trend as well as I or anyone else But Apple continues to miss opportunities as a result The PC market is evolving rapidly into a mobile device market Most of the Macs Apple sells are MacBooks Most of the PCs sold are laptops or in convertible laptoptablet hybrids Apples combined iPad and MacBook sales are still miniscule compared to this overall market According to Gartner Researc h in million PCs were sold including Windows tablets In the same period Apple sold million Macs and million iPads Apple still has a lot of room for growth in the PC market Apple could be doing a lot better but in order to do so it needs to let go of the dogma that PCs and touchscreens dont mix They do they are and they will continue to become more important I havent been this critical of Apple in a long time and perhaps it was overdue Ive been hearing more accusations that Im just an Apple fan boy lately But Im still an Apple investor and heres why Once again in the issue of convergence we see an Apple operating within unnecessary and self imposed limitations The situation prior to the advent of the larger screen iPhone was similar Apple dogma imposed a limitation on screen size that hurt iPhone sales Mims looks at Apples relatively small Mac sales and says jettison Macs because theyre a needless distraction I see the situation with Mac as indicative of a missed opportunity Mac could be much more important to Apple if it would just let go of the dogma as well as become more price competitive The PC market is after all a very price competitive market Releasing an ARM based Mac is the way for Apple to achieve that greater price competitiveness while maintaining high margins Just as Apple eventually relented on the issue of iPhone screen size I believe market forces will lead Apple to relent on its stance on convergence as well as other issues such as using its ARM SOCs for the Mac When that happens well see a substantial renaissance of MaciPad sales Exactly how Apple plays this remains to be seen Apple might endow iPad with even more PClike characteristics or it might endow Mac
