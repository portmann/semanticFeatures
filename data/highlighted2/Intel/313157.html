Deep Dive Into Intels Results And Why Could Be Much Worse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>delivered negative revenue growth of in despite managements bullish expectations of lowsingle digits in Management provided the same lowsingle digits growth outlook for Intels operating income as a percentage of revenue declined for the PC and Data Center Group which means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will need revenue growth to receive the same operating income contribution Headwinds including saturation phablets longer replacement cycles and lack of excitement in Windows releases will continue to plague the PC industry for years to come Intels leadership needs to do more to increase shareholder value whether it comes down to divesting existing assets or making a significant acquisition to drive revenue and earnings growth If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues on its current trajectory shareholders will continue to see revenue stagnate and decline as well as an eventual decline in profits despite Intels propensity to buy back shares <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC finished out with overall revenue coming in at billion or a decline of billion or below revenue levels of billion Intels management expected revenue to grow midsingle digits in but as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors are aware the company fell well short Intels management gave similar revenue growth prospects for but is the plan achievable and what needs to happen for growth to resume at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In short I believe everything needs to go right for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to grow revenue midsingle digits in and I have very little confidence management can pull it off with significant headwinds facing the company and the industries they compete in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has several headwinds that will continue to plague growth rates for years to come Major headwinds include saturation and a cyclical decline of PC sales coupled with increased competition within data centers The chart below depicts Intels annual revenue since however since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has failed to deliver any semblance of revenue growth despite through organic methods or acquisitions McAfee billion in Intels revenue has grown at a CAGR from through increasing from billion in to billion in The biggest headwind facing the PC industry and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is saturation Research firms like Gartner and IDC continue to believe that Windows releases will fuel future PC growth The truth of the matter is PC growth is being driven by unit replacements and the introduction of new versions of Windows is not and will not fuel industry growth As PCs continue to improve in performance in coming years I would expect the replacement cycle to lengthen which in turn will continue to threaten PC growth rates Another key factor that is impacting PC growth rates that will not go away are competitive threats from tablets and in devices In addition to tablets the continued adoption of larger phablets smartphones over five inches decrease the need for consumers to own a PC Intels revenue generated from PCs represented in which was down from in and in In terms of dollar figures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recorded billion in PC revenue in in and billion in The charts below depict Intels nominal revenue by business sector as well as the percentage of quarterly revenue coming from each business segment In terms of operating income generated from PCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has seen that metric drop from in to in Intels Data Center Group accounted for of operating income in up from in The chart below depicts Intels percent of operating income by business segment As you can see DCG and PC have been taking turns as the leader over the past five quarters The shift toward increased operating income generated outside of PCs is usually a bullish metric however the contribution to net income for every of revenue produced from DCG is declining which means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has more pressure to grow the top line just to achieve the same operating income contribution Intels top business segments account for greater than of Intels operating income because the companys Other business unit continues to drag on business operations The unit has contributed negative operating income of in and negative in as a percentage of total operating income As you can see from the chart below Intels business strategy continues to be dragged down significantly by the Other line of business Intels Other business segment has chewed up billion of operating income in the past two years including billion in alone Intels decline in operating income generated by a of revenue has not only declined for the PC segment over the past two years but has declined within the Data Center Group as well dropping from in to in This metric is particularly troublesome for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and amid continued competition and slowing sector growth rates these metrics will continue to come under pressure In terms of operating income generated by of revenue from PCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>saw this metric decline from cents in to cents The chart below depicts the amount of operating income generated for every of revenue with representing cents As you can see there is no clear leadership for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and the overall business portfolio cant top and continues to fluctuate between and each quarter As pricing pressure and competition emerge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be even more challenged to maintain these operating metrics going forward At the moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has no new product or quick fix that can jump start revenue or operating income If you are looking at IoT and SaaS to deliver organic growth that can revitalize Intels earnings and revenue growth it is time to think again These two business units have not grown over the past two years and still represent less than of Intels total revenue and less than of Intels overall operating income <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not selling enough IoT or SaaS and the amount of operating income generated for every in combined revenue lags the PC segment and the Data Center Group by a considerable margin Intels Altera acquisition will be reported in and investors can expect a contribution to the top line of billion This figure is considerably less than the billion of revenue analysts were expecting from Altera as a standalone company prior to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acquisition If you are an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investor and expected Altera to make a difference immediately in it is time you think again I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to finish with anemic annual growth of or less with more than a chance of a sequential decline in revenue despite managements bullish guidance PC industry shipments will decline significantly greater than forecasted by Gartner which will lead to another annual decline of Intels PC revenue in On the data center front <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>controls nearly all of the demand for server chips that power networks and data centers which only positions the company to lose not gain any market share as new entrants including Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM look to create pricing pressure against Intels book of business According to recent reports Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is looking to replace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips with Qualcomm for its data centers If Google does indeed move over to Qualcomm chips for data centers it would open the door for other companys to shift their spending to a new supplier as well which would be a major blow and disruption to Intels business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders should be demanding more from the companys management Intels leadership needs to do more to increase shareholder value whether it comes down to divesting existing assets or making a significant acquisition to drive revenue and earnings growth over the next to years If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues on its current trajectory shareholders will continue to see revenue stagnate and decline as well as an eventual decline in profits despite Intels propensity to buy back shares and increase earnings without being aided by organic growth Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
