for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>planning three chip architectures at nm node The chip will lose its node advantage with such a timeline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has been able to absolutely dominate the x segment so far due to its competitive lead in chip manufacturing process relative to its peers The chipmaker as of today still enjoys the lead However as per the most recent leak it looks as though Intels highly coveted node advantage is about to shrink going forward More to the point there is reason to believe that its upcoming Ice Lake chips could be just at par with competition in terms of fabrication process Lets take a closer look at whats happening here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been so far operating on a ticktock release model While every tick represents an advancement of fabrication process its accompanying tock cycle introduces a new architecture using its latest manufacturing technology This model has recently been taking about years for completion which the management was earlier aiming to reduce down to years going forth But that may not be on the cards The recent leak published by Wccftechcom reveals that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has again broken this ticktock cycle and is now working on three not two CPU architectures for its upcoming nm process namely Cannon Lake Ice Lake and Tiger Lake that are scheduled for release in H and respectively I call this the ticktocktoe model for the sake of practicality This model isnt exactly new Weve seen the toe cycle on Intels nm and nm nodes in the form of Devils Lake and Kaby Lake in the past The chipmaker never formally announced that it would stick to three architectures per node so it was always assumed that the chipzilla would return to two architectures per node and get its ticktock model back on track After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to build and sustain its manufacturing lead over its competitors by maintaining its to year cadence in the first place However this leak suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>intends to have a slower refresh cycle yet again and that its year targeted cadence would largely be unachievable going forth To put things in perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would have to release a new architecture in about every months in order to reach that goal This isnt a practical goal considering that the overall PC industry is experiencing a global slowdown Granted that this slow refresh cycle would have some shortterm financial benefits for Intels shareholders in the form of reduced capital expenditure and lower annual depreciation expenses However this would also allow competitors to catchup with the chipzilla in terms of fabrication process technology For example Samsung OTCSSNLF will be migrating to a nm node this year which is believed to be equivalent to Intels nm tech Also Digitimes reported this week that Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE TSM will be taping out its nm chips in the coming months and it expects to massproduce nm and nm chips by and respectively Because Intels manufacturing process is superior to Taiwan Semiconductors the latters nm chips would sort of be equivalent to the formers nm chips I believe that this would somewhat level the playing field during and would eventually mark the end Intels dominance in terms of chip fabrication process technology The competing factor at this stage would eventually end up being the chip architecture The repercussions of this catchingup of competition are manifold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>hasnt been able to crack the mobile market till date in spite of having a relatively advanced fabrication process and rival ARM NASDAQ ARMH offerings manufactured at comparable nodes may further intensify the competition This can eventually lock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>out of the mobile segment for good if its chip architectures are not competitive The chipzilla may also have to rely on deep discounting to make its chips competitive compared to ARM if the gains arent substantial This narrowing of technological lead might as well promote ARMbased competition in the server segment Granted that ARM servers dont have a market yet and majority of its platforms existing today are currently being used only for testing purposes But how would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>defend its market dominance in the server space with its nm chips when AMD Qualcomm AppliedMicro and Cavium eventually begin the mass producing nm ARMbased microserver chips during Itll all come down to differences in architecturedriven metrics such as performance and performancewatt More to the point AMDs NASDAQ AMD muchanticipated nmbased Zen lineup will be introduced starting QFY Up until now AMD hasnt been able to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in terms as the former introduced chips based on relatively inferior fabrication process But this time at a comparable and competitive node its Zen lineup will have a real chance of succeeding given the architecture doesnt get botched up The point that Im making is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont be able to dominate the PC and Server segments anymore just because of its node advantage The chipzilla will be experiencing competition from all fronts going forward and it would have to innovate and outdo its rivals in order to keep its competitors at bay Of course Taiwan Semiconductor could face headwinds in the form of poor yields ramp issues or poor margins and high cost of production due to expanding too quickly But on a larger scale I believe Intels lead is over </div></body></html>
