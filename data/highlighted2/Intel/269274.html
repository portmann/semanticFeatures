NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha ARM in collaboration with Nokia and Enea has established the OFP Foundation OFP is revamping the TCPIP stack for the highcapacity networks of the future ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH Nokia NYSE NOK and IT services player Enea have taken a new initiative to reinvigorate the ageold TCPIP stack for tomorrows highcapacity networks These networks will be driven by increased throughput and significant reduction in latency compared to todays networks The three companies founded the OpenFastPath OFP Foundation for creating an open source TCPIP stack for tomorrows networks Will this new initiative challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC No it will not Intels reference architecture for the telcos will play an important role in highcapacity network applications of the future Such applications will flourish utilizing the convergence of telco data center and SDN softwaredefined networks In addition NFV network functions virtualization also will drive the adoption these network applications Intels effort to integrate SDN and NFV on standard x platforms made it well positioned in this area As a result ARMs initiative will be beneficial for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ARM has a long way to go before reaping the benefits of the initiative Hewlett Packard Enterprise NYSE HPE AMD NASDAQ AMD Cavium NASDAQ CAVM Freescale and Linaro also are supporting the initiative by joining the OFP Foundation Since fastpath data movement can significantly boost the performance of an application that moves lots of data by reducing CPU utilization the initiative could be highly productive The OFP Foundation will form a developer community that will change the current TCPIP stack to fastpath TCPIP stack The new TCPIP stack that will be optimized for SDN will support faster packet transfer utilizing low IP latency and high data rate The open source FreeBSD operating system which is a Unixlike OS will support the new fastpath TCPIP stack The fastpath TCPIP stack will boost the development of the G standard since high throughput coupled with extremely low latency will be the building block of the G mobile communications system G will be in the forefront of the Tactile Internet where machines instead of humans will be primarily involved in communications Tactile Internet will change the Internet of the future and its impact on society by building a completely new digital infrastructure The new digital infrastructure will take TCPIP away from the kernel space to the user space According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>For years the traditional thinking behind high performance networking has been to take all the packet processing functionality and push as much as possible into the kernel That model has been changing as the cost of always crossing the divide between kernel and user space context switching on interrupts to service packets and copying the data has limited performance of packet processing applications Scaling for performance on multicore systems has led to new approaches in architecting network software For example all the functionality and processing the kernel has been doing including the network drivers is now being placed directly into the user space application and the application now is assuming direct control of NUMA core affinity and parallelism With the mobile processing field fast getting saturated ARM is desperately trying to gain market share in the server chip business The advent of telco data centers could be a significant opportunity for ARM The new TCPIP stack will support all processor architectures including x PowerPC and ARM The mere fact that the new TCPIP stack will support ARM architecture will not ensure longterm success for ARM in the new field of communication processing including G ARM knows very well that it needs to remain relevant in the entire process by expanding the horizon of its hugely successful mobile ecosystem in cloud and IoT ARMs development of TrustZone a set of security extensions for ARM CPUs is a step in the right direction Furthermore to make its CPUs fit for IoT ARM has developed an mbed IoT device platform which is encouraging With establishing the OFP Foundation ARM has solidified its ecosystem further in an effort to combat Intels new x platform in the networking marketplace The advantage of Intels new x platform that works by integrating SDN and NFV over the generic x platform is that the latter provides only capex savings for telecom operators while the former is capable of providing both capex and opex savings Intels series of coprocessors coupled with baseband processing supports its Xeon server chips Moreover it has a host of hardware and software tools in its arsenal for boosting the performance and efficiency of telco data centers Thats why Nokia depends on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for providing solutions to its telecom customers despite the fact that its collaborating with ARM for developing a fastpath TCPIP stack However Nokias collaboration with ARM also means that ARM is still in the race But as I said above ARM has a long way to go before reaping the benefits of establishing the OFP Foundation Intels ONP open network platform server reference architecture that was introduced in offers a simplified approach to accelerate the adoption of SDN and NFV For developing a sustainable ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>relies on open source software components Various new and emerging standards such as Open vSwitch OpenFlow OpenDaylight and OpenStack are associated with Intels ONP server reference design Intels offerings help telecom operators lower their costs both opex and capex by virtualizing their data center resources If ARM wants to become successful it has to make sure its products also result in cost savings I believe competition is healthy for an emerging industry as it helps make progress at a rapid pace Intels competitive advantage is so strong that its helping the company reap benefits from its rivals initiative This is another
