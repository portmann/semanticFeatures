<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Will Recover In FY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had a rough start to a year but theres room for surprise in the PCCG in the back half of the year Also expanding operating profits paired with a slight reduction in capex gives management added flexibility to increase its share buyback authorization I anticipate that volume and improvement in yield will ultimately result in a slight surprise on gross margins above the midpoint of the guidance range When combining all these factors bottom line results are likely to improve considerably over the shortterm Longterm the infant business opportunity in both mobile and storage will offset stagnant to low PC growth implying reasonable growth rates when operating on a fiveyear time frame I guess anyone looking at Intels NASDAQ INTC stock chart would scratch the back of their head and say sheesh why is this stock performing so badly It carried the Dow Jones last year and now its the dog this year Talk about a change of events Despite shortterm price action the business does have sound fundamentals and certain business segments will carry the company going forward Hence there are logical reasons for why investors should jump back in at the low s The capital intensity of moving to more advanced nodes is expected to decline as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>addresses the issue with more density This sort of counters the arguments that were made by McKinsey Company where the analyst asserted that moving to more advanced nodes will cause capex to increase significantly As mentioned by Stacy Smith CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>We are moving to reuse capital by rolling forward to nanometer and to align overall capacity with demand We are now forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at billion down billion from the prior outlook We do agree capital intensity is going to go up as measured by capital cost per square inch of silicon We believe that through and with some insight all the way down the nanometer we can offset that increase in capital cost per square inch of silicon by improving our density And so we can keep the cost per transistor coming down at the historical close Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can stabilize sales coming out of the PC Client Group while capex drops significantly yearoveryear theres decent suspicion that there will be extra free cash flow for share buybacks In FY capex was billion so capex will decline by roughly billion Operating income will likely increase by perhaps to yearoveryear which is somewhat dependent on PCCG Growth in the bottom line is highly likely as the higher margin business units are growing sales at pretty healthy rates So operating margin expansio paired with additional free cash flow will drive share buyback increases And while the management team didnt offer much outlook on share buybacks on the conference call Im willing to throw in the speculation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can offset the lack of sales growth in the back half with an even more generous share buyback authorization improving sentiment around the stock on the basis of EPS expansion Furthermore the PC Client group outlook is based more on openended speculation on business customers in comparison to consumers and with an aging number of computers that are more than fouryearsold there could be ample justification for better than expected inventory buildup going into the holiday season ie Q FY This could drive the shortterm argument for investing into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as better than expected FCF and a moderate surprise on the top line will also drive the gross margin figure by a single percentage point or two After all margins should technically improve on the back of better yields at the nm node but with the dropoff in utilization for nm and the shift in costs for m the two cancel each other out at least thats what was mentioned on the earnings conference call So the only logical reason to anticipate some improvement on gross margins is if the PCCG comes in at to yoy so a beat on that segment would significantly alter growth assumptions and would increase gross margins as higher utilization of fabs increases gross margins because the cost of revenue operates on a curve in which higher total volume will lower the average total cost Admittedly there are various reasons why thirdparty research firms like IDC are pessimistic on PCs Tower PCs dont appeal to consumers and consumers simply dont have the spending power to justify the purchase of a laptop a tower PC mobile devices and various other consumer electronic devices But that doesnt mean that between both laptops and towers that the market itself is set to contract I think ASPs should eventually trend higher as Ultrabooks which have higher storage capacity beefier CPUs better screens and similar portability to tablets will attract consumers ultimately dragging ASPs higher However if that argument doesnt satisfy the skeptics theres simply no replacement to the productivity that either a laptop or desktop PC provides In the case of desktop PCs theres always a market for workstationoriented people who need the additional screens graphics capability and CPU power to get highly complex tasks taken care of So therefore the productivity oriented PC market should be growing at a somewhat linear pace based on the broader growth in consumption globally I dont understand why this hasnt happened which is why I think PC demand tends to be cyclical but isnt really linked with the economy but rather the age of the installed base of computers In that case refresh isnt as tied to broader macro issues like GDP and is more tied to the willingness of consumers to replace a computer with a better computer PC refresh points may have gotten a little more elongated but eventually the growth will likely return at some point and will likely be tied to a set of features like Direct X universal apps and cloud storage Personally I think cloud storage is a huge deal because it makes it easier for users to migrate over files from one computer to the next as accessing the information is based on user account information rather than a lengthy process of file transfers from one external hard drive to the next Admittedly there are other businesses that I havent discussed in this article For example the D NAND business is set to takeoff as both the featureset and economics of SSDs will destroy the market for mechanical drives in both enterprise and consumer Theres also the fact that the mobile business is set to improve its profitability as contrarevenue support will decline and improvements in cost structure due to overlapping RD and intellectual property paired with volume ramp will turn the business into a major profit center Overall I plan to address the other business units in a more comprehensive article The Micron partnership is a little more nuanced as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron will share revenue Also determining the size of the storage and mobile market and the impact on revenue will require extensive wok to fully quantify Source Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Will Recover In FY Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks
