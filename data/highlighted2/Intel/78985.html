Buys Micron Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha Jun PM ET About Micron Technology Inc MU Includes INTC SNDK SSNLF STX WDC by Russ Fischer Seagate and Western Digital need to own NAND fabs OK now that I have your attention we can talk about further consolidation and deals in the memory business Who needs to be in the memory business China has declared the semiconductor business a strategic business A general semiconductor industry without a memory component is a weak hand So China would have a serious interest in being in the memory business Seagate NASDAQ STX and Western Digital NASDAQ WDC absolutely need to be in the NAND business or face a rapid decline to shadow of their present size It is interesting the WDC has a partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on NAND and Seagate has a partnership with Micron on NAND Of course this is the same NAND technology since the product is provided by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Micron NASDAQ MU joint venture I discussed this in a previous article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the memory storage business but has an adequate deal for now through the IntelMicron joint venture IMFT Samsung OTCSSNLF is out of course Hynix is probably out and in any case is weak in NAND which is the memory growth of the future SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK is available It is only NAND which should be of intense interest to Seagate or Western Digital less so to China SanDisk is fully priced and with an acquisition premium would be quite expensive Still it would get either of the HDD Hard Disk Drive guys into the NAND business I find it curious that neither of the HDD guys has made a move on SanDisk yet Micron is available but any offer would have to be in the per share area With low rates either Seagate or Western Digital could probably pull it off with stock and borrowed money The nice thing about Micron is that their current earnings would make the acquisition accretive to earnings for anyone who might be interested even with all borrowed money China could pull it off with what amounts to lunch money but one might expect our government to have something to say about that Micron after all is the only Western Hemisphere based broad line memory company and is therefore pretty strategic to old Uncle Sam Seagate might have a similar problem in that the tax dodgers decided to move their headquarters to Ireland So that realistically leaves Western Digital and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as candidates to buy Micron <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is up to their ears in the ongoing acquisition of Altera trying to swallow Micron at this point might not be a good idea Also there is the argument of Why buy the cow when the milk is free <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has access to planar and D NAND and all Micron emerging nonvolatile memory technologies with through IMFT JV <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is also free to produce these products outside of the JV if they wish to You have to wonder what happens to the JV if Western Digital or anyone buys Micron the JV does have an end of life in the agreement Micron would be wonderfully accretive to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings from day one about share accretive Micron would basically pay for themselves with a pile of growing earnings left over Apparently Western Digital is not interested in SanDisk They must see something they dont like So I dont quite understand why Western Digital isnt breaking open their piggy bank to buy Micron Perhaps the IntelMicron JV has some deterrence built into it So Micron either goes to Western Digital or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or stays independent Heres where it gets a little interesting We know that the four D NAND suppliers are using different approaches to the technology The biggest difference is that IntelMicron picked floating gate as the storage element while Samsung and apparently everyone else chose a charge trap technology which is an easier technology to implement in a D structure In recent analyst presentations by Micron management there have been hints that not all is well with the charge trap technology used or planned to be used by everyone but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron In a recent Jefferies presentation Kipp Bedard VP of Investor Relations mentioned that the Samsung charge trap is so leaky that a thumb drive full of pictures stored in a desk drawer might come up blank in six months You can listen for yourself here at about minute Now Kipp has been around this business since Christ was a corporal and isnt likely to throw this kind of stuff out unless it is true because payback is really tough In a recent presentation to Bernstein President Mark Adams alluded to some evidence that Samsung had moved some D NAND production from China back to Korea apparently to get the A team on some problem resolution You can also listen to Mark here at about minute Now Mark is one of those good ol guys who says it like it is He thinks about his answers so as to not misspeak but comes up with real answers to real questions as opposed to the standard Pablum that we have all come to choke down Apparently SanDisk isnt exactly the acquisition Bell of the Ball at this point Neither China Seagate nor Western Digital is flirting with this gem Both Seagate and Western Digital have partnerships around the IntelMicron floating gate D NAND and planar of course Speculation is growing that not all is well with the Samsung D NAND program Is it possible that the IntelMicron D NAND is the only viable product in this category I think they are worth a play I prefer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because there is so much else going on there but Micron can also be bought here but be careful with Micron the May qtr and guidance might be a little ragged due to low DRAM prices Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please
