and strength in data center the Internet of Things and programmable solutions will pave the way for ongoing companywide expansion Unlike the IBMs of the world where revenue is in freefall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not struggling and its purchase of assetlight freecashflow rich Altera was a very savvy move even though it has strained the balance sheet a bit By our measures long and shortterm debt stood at billion at the end of the second quarter slightly higher than the sum of total cash investments and marketable equity securities billion Management said on the conference call that it expects to improve its net cash balance over the second half of the year however Though restructuring charges associated with layoffs muddied accounting earnings <span

company is buying back its undervalued stock hand over fist We love Intels dividend growth potential it sports a Dividend Cushion ratio of and we have no qualms with management scooping up its equity on the cheap During the quarter the company repurchased million shares and still has a whopping billion remaining dollars authorized for buyback Trading at less than times currentyear nonGAAP earnings estimates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a rare bargain in todays overheated equity market and has a nice dividend yield to boot The company last upped its dividend payout in January of this year and we expect many more years of dividend increases to come Free cash flow generation at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is tremendous and management aims to please We think convergence to our estimate of intrinsic value found in the Valuation Analysis section of this article may happen sooner than later at the company even if it has a few tough trading sessions following these secondquarter results It could very well hit multiyear highs before the year is up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>designs and manufactures advanced integrated digital technology platforms which are used in PCs including Ultrabooks servers tablets smartphones automobiles automated factory systems and medical devices The company recently completed

expected to be accretive to nonGAAP EPS and free cash flow in Though many fear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be left behind by the mobile revolution we think those worries

helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>take iPhone share from rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains confident in the resurrection of PC demand as it estimates that it has an opportunity to replace billion PCs that are years old in the near term The strength of Intels dividend is noteworthy even as it posts a yield near Though the deal with Altera has absorbed some of its cash Intels Dividend Cushion ratio remains very healthy and is well above In our opinion the best measure of a firms ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firms economic profit spread Intels year historical return on invested capital without goodwill is which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of As such we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT In the chart below we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome in our opinion and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate Firms that generate a free cash flow margin free cash flow divided by total revenue above are usually considered cash cows Intels free cash flow margin has averaged about during the past years As such we think the firms cash flow generation is relatively STRONG The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow FCFF which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cash flow from operations decreased about from levels registered two years ago while capital expenditures fell about over the same time period Intels Dividend Cushion ratio is among the best in our coverage after considering the size of its annual dividend yield Were huge fans of Intels dividend growth prospects and we include it in the Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio The firm recently completed its acquisition of Altera in a near billion deal which enables it to compete in new classes of products in its high growth Data Center and Internet of Things segments These two segments will be areas of focus for the company moving forward and it expects to continue to allocate additional resources to the divisions as it cuts spending in the areas of software PC and phonestablets We like the strategy and expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to be able capture future customer needs with ongoing innovations The firms tremendous free cash flow generation will continue to be the basis of its dividend strength After considering the typical operational risks of a company in such a competitive and rapidlyevolving industry perhaps the largest threat to material future dividend growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is its weakened balance sheet In the first quarter of the firms cash and cash equivalents position fell to billion from billion and its net cash position swung to a net debt position as a result of the Altera merger Though we do not like the deterioration of its balance sheet strength we continue to have faith in Intels free cash flow generation and the Altera acquisition is expected to be accretive to free cash flow immediately All things considered we like what the deal does for the company on a longterm basis even if it may impact dividend health in the near term We think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is worth per share with a fair value range of The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them Our nearterm operating forecasts including revenue and earnings do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of during the next five years a pace that is higher than the firms year historical compound annual growth rate of Our model reflects a year projected average operating margin of which is above Intels trailing year average Beyond year we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of for the next years and in perpetuity For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>we use a weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows Although we estimate the firms fair value at about per share every company has a range of probable fair values thats created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers like future revenue or earnings for example After all if the future were known with certainty we wouldnt see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock In the graph above we show this probable range of fair values for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>We think the firm is attractive below per share the green line but quite expensive above per share the red line The prices that fall along the yellow line which includes our fair value estimate represent a reasonable valuation for the firm in our opinion We estimate Intels fair value at this point in time to be about per share As time passes however companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends The chart above compares the firms current share price with the path of Intels expected equity value per share over the next three years assuming our longterm projections prove accurate The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year represents our best estimate of the value of the firms shares three years hence This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time should our views on the firms future cash flow potential change The expected fair value of per share in Year represents our existing fair value per share of increased at an annual rate of the firms cost of equity less its dividend yield The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be
