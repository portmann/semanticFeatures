<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Just Take A Bite Out Of Qualcomm Qualcomm Inc NASDAQQCOM Seeking Alpha VentureBeat reports that Intels LTE chips are rumored to be included in iPhone units in certain emerging markets The potential deal could be a coup for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and its efforts to gain share in the mobile market VentureBeat is reporting that Intels NASDAQ INTC XMM G baseband modem is rumored be included in iPhone units aimed at emerging markets in Asia and Latin America The site adds Apple NASDAQ AAPL engineers have been making trips to Munich Germany to work with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>engineers to ready the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE chip for the iPhone and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been willing to go a long way to get its LTE chips into Apple phones Infineon was once the iPhones G baseband supplier before Apple switched to Qualcomm The XMM supports Cat LTE Mbps peak download speeds as well as x carrier aggregation If the rumors are accurate Intels modem chip could be taking a slot longreserved for Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM a leader in chips for mobile devices Analysts estimate that Qualcomm controls a share for chipsets in mobile phones Qualcomm also is known to have several chips inside the iPhone In addition to a Cat LTE baseband modem a Qualcomm power management IC RF transceiver receiveonly chip and an envelopetracing IC improves battery life were found in the iPhone Plus Apple is loathe to rely on one vendor for any of its components so the rumors make sense from a strategic standpoint Still it would be a coup for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which has been trying to build a presence in mobile devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has dominant market share in processors for personal computers However consumers are now using mobile devices to perform certain tasks that they previously used PCs for In the previous quarter Intels mobile division incurred a billion operating loss as the company sold its chips at a loss in order to build market share If Intels XMM G baseband modem performs well it could result in Apple extending the potential relationship to additional products or additional regions of the world The rumored deal may not have a big impact on Qualcomm financially at first However it is symbolic in that i as the second largest smartphone vendor Apple is a key relationship for chip suppliers and ii it could be the start of Apples attempt to wield more power over Qualcomm Over a month ago Samsung OTC SSNLF dropped Qualcomm as its supplier of snapdragon processors for the Galaxy S smartphone preferring to fulfill its processor needs from its inhouse semiconductor unit Apple Could Continue To Diversity Suppliers In its most recent quarter Qualcomm grew revenue YY to billion QCT Qualcomm CDMA Techologies revenue of billion was up YY and QTL Qualcomm Technology Licensing revenue of billion was up YY QCT reflects equipment sales such as LTE chips and modems and snapdragon processors while QTL reflects licensing sales Qualcomm shipped million chip shipments during the quarter up YY However the loss of Samsungs Galaxy S business and the rumored encroachment of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on its baseband modem business could have a negative impact on future chipset shipments Companies from Mediatek OTCPK MEDT and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD are trying to increase their presence in the mobile space There is a risk that they could entice Apple to further diversity their vendor relationships away from Qualcomm Though chipset shipments were up YY revenue from the QTC group only increased YY That implies that Qualcomms average sales price asp per chipset is in decline Chipset asp declined YY from to unit There was a shift in OEM share from Samsung a buyer of snapdragon processors to Apple which buys modems Thus the product mix has been skewed toward more modems which have a lower asp Apple and Samsung represented Qualcomms two largest customers With the loss of Samsungs processor business Qualcomm may be willing to make more concessions in order to appease Apple In situations where Apple is a vendors largest customer it has been known to receive an advantaged price for components For instance Invensense NYSE INVN provides accelerometers for the iPhone In wooing Apple away from STMicroelectronics NYSE STM Invensense offered Apple an advantageous price The new business increased Invensenses top line but hurt its asp and gross margins I would not be surprised if Apple asks for future price concessions from Qualcomm in order to maintain its supplier relationship The rumored IntelApple arrangement could help jump start Intels mobile ambitions I have a hold rating on INTC given that the lions share of its revenue still comes from the PC industry which is experiencing slow growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recently slashed its Q revenue estimate due to weaker demand for personal computers I have a sell rating on QCOM given the loss of the Samsung business and potential for its chipset asp to decline further Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major
