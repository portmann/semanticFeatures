threatened The in form factor is the emerging trend for laptops Microsoft needs to protect its lead on this product category Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT posted a increase in its Surface tabletnotebook revenue during the previous quarter However the longterm appeal of Windowsbased detachable laptops may eventually suffer from Remix OSbased products like Jides Android Ultratablet computers Created by former Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL engineers Remix OS transformed the touchfocused mobile Android operating system into a mouseandkeyboardbased OS This is something that Google has failed to deliver with its Pixel C in product IDCs latest report confirmed that the in form factor is the emerging future of notebooks Remix OS now threatens the future sales of Windowsbased in laptops It allows OEMs to create true productivityfocused Android computers Many firsttime in buyers would love to own a notebook that looks like its running Windows and also has access to millions of Android appsgames Some people will find the lightweight Android computer the better portable productivity tool than the Surface Book Aside from Office Google Apps For Work also runs well on bigdisplay Android devices People who cannot afford the Surface or Pixel C may go for the Remix Ultratablet Its a true alternative to Wintel in machines Microsofts OEM partners like HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ Acer and Dell who sell sub hybrid Windowsbased detachable notebooks will suffer from Androids debut on desktop computing The Cube i Remix is a touchenabled in product with an <span style='background-color:

the obvious expansion products Googles ambition to invade the desktop OS territory of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Microsoft is easier done with Android The persistent rumor of Alphabet enabling Google Play Store and GMS on Chromebooks is unlikely to happen soon Remix OS is here and ready to be exploited Phoenix OS is another desktop reworking of Android Chromebooks never made it big outside the education market This is largely due to its lack of good apps and horrible touchscreen compatibility The cancellation of Googles Project Athena meant Chrome OS will remain a browserbased operating system that is unfit for in products Chromebooks will continue to reduce Windows laptops presence in schools and AndroidBooks could target the enterprisemainstream customers Yes I believe business users and ordinary consumers will likely favor the in AndroidBook over the clamshellonly Chromebook AndroidBooks is my own descriptive term to describe all Android laptops that run like Remix OSbased machines Unless Microsoft can persuade its OEM partners to also come up with Windowsbased in products AndroidBooks could derail the sales of Windows computers A successful transition of Android from mobile to the desktop PC will prevent Microsoft from reaching its billion devices target for Windows AndroidBooks not Chromebooks are the potential threats to the multibillion surface revenue stream
