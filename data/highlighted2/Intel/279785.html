wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Stocks fall has pushed annual yield to key level Investors expecting another increase in a few months For shares of Apple NASDAQ AAPL the past few weeks have not been pretty Fears over an iPhone sales slowdown have pushed the stock towards its yearly low if you exclude the August flash crash for a minute With shares almost back to investors looking at the stock are now presented with a dividend yield thats back over on an annual basis For some there is a major psychological difference for the annual yield topping this level A dividend yield that starts with a does not seem like much but when you get to the level people start to notice According to a finviz stock screener there are stocks in the SP with a dividend yield above If we go to a greater than yield that number drops by over names A little more than half of this key index has dividend yields topping I cover Apple a lot on Seeking Alpha and one of the biggest complaints about the stock Ive gotten in recent years is the dividend yield The company is in an interesting stage right now because it is trying to grow and be a tremendous value name at the same time Currently Apple management is more focused on buying back shares then paying dividends which I think is a more prudent strategy There are those out there that criticize Apple for not having a dividend yield as high as Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC However there are plenty of large cap tech names that dont offer investors any income opportunities let alone a multibillion dollar per quarter buyback While a number of investors are screaming for Apple to significantly increase the dividend the stocks fall has done that to an extent already At the stocks week high of shares were yielding less than on an annual basis At Monday mornings low that amount has risen by just about basis points As seen from the table in Apples K filing below Apple has increased its dividend by a decent amount in recent years paying out over billion in the past three fiscal years Apples dividend itself has risen even more thanks to the companys buyback plan The company has reduced the outstanding share count by over the past three fiscal years As seen in the chart below Apples share count is coming down around per year which allows the dividend to increase without the company having to dole out more cash Apple has increased its total payments though as I detailed above Source Apple financial information page Now I know that one of my predictions was that Apples potential dividend raise this year will likely disappoint Im not saying that Apple wont raise its dividend but I just dont see the company giving into those calling for some major raise My official raise prediction will come in the next couple of months but I still see a raise probably around or so inline with the recent pattern While a annual yield might not seem like much investors have to think about Apple in the grand scheme of things Savings accounts and CDs are getting you basically nothing right now In the table below you can see how what US Treasuries currently yield with Apples pretax income roughly equaling a Year offering With many expecting bond yields to jump in the coming years as the Federal Reserve raises rates bond prices will come down Would you rather own Apple or a US bond for the next years By the way a dividend raise would put Apples current yield above what the Year Treasury currently fetches Shares of Apple declined Monday morning with the overall market although they arent down as much as some of the tech sectors high growth names such as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN or Facebook NASDAQ FB This is probably because AAPL has come down a lot lately pushing the annual dividend yield over In fact Apple is currently testing its week daily low close unadjusted for dividends With the stock hitting this psychologically important dividend level the stock becomes a more exclusive part of certain indices Since fixed income rates are low and bond prices will decline if we get further rate hikes Apple may be worth a look for investors looking to generate income For those complaining about Apples dividend the yield is up about basis points from its yearly low Youre also getting a tremendous buyback and paying a below average market multiple for this cash generation monster Additional disclosure Investors are always reminded that before making any investment you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in
