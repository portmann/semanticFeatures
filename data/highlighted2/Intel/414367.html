Challenged Intels Memory Technology International Business Machines Corporation NYSEIBM Seeking Alpha IBM developed an advanced memory technology that can challenge Intels D XPoint technology If IBM commercially exploits the technology it can temporarily seize Intels market share IBM NYSE IBM has announced that its scientists have demonstrated a highcaliber data storing method using a relatively new memory technology known as PCM phasechange memory Mainstream media is saying that IBMs memory technology can be a potential threat for Intels NASDAQ INTC D XPoint pronounced crosspoint technology in the long run <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in association with Micron NASDAQ MU announced in that they developed D XPoint a breakthrough memory technology which will become the new memory standard Intels XPointbased Optane SSDs solidstate drives are due for release this year Can IBMs new technology adversely affect Optane sales In the long run no IBM Challenged Intels D XPoint Technology If IBM plans to commercially exploit the PCM memory technology right away Intels Optane sales might suffer temporarily IBM said that its research team has showed how to reliably store bits of data per cell using PCM technology PCM is a nonvolatile RAM which uses a chalcogenide material to store data Earlier IBMs scientists as well as scientists from other institutions showed that PCM can store bit of data per cell Dr Haris Pozidis manager of nonvolatile memory research at IBM said Reaching bits per cell is a significant milestone because at this density the cost of PCM will be significantly less than DRAM and closer to flash In light of Dr Pozidis comment I believe IBM will kick off mass production of costeffective and highly durable SSDs in a year or so challenging Intels D XPointbased Optane SSDs With the new era of memory driven computing ushering in there are definite use cases for both memory technologies particularly in areas where either large memory capacity or highspeed storage is an absolute necessity such as machine learning genome sequencing and climate modeling to name a few In the long run however the superior technology will prevail The moot question is which technology is superior Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is touting that XPoint is the biggest advancement in memory technology in the last years its memory cell stores a single bit of data compared to IBMs bits For accessing the memory cells variations of voltages are applied in both technologies In order to know which technology is superior we need to solve the puzzle if XPoint is actually a variation of PCM D XPoint can be either PCMbased or ReRAMbased Resistive RAM although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron repeatedly said that XPoint isnt PCMbased PCM uses a chalcogenide material and stores data by heating and cooling the chalcogenide material to switch between two phases viz amorphoustocrystalline and crystallinetoamorphous ReRAM on the other hand works by creating defects on the thin oxide layer of a memristor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said about XPoint The switching mechanism is via changes in resistance of the bulk material This implies that XPoint isnt entirely PCMbased and might have similarities with nonfilamentary ReRAM IMFT the JV between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron to make flash memory cochair Guy Blalock admitted that D XPoint uses a chalcogenide material If thats the case it certainly has the characteristics of PCM Now it will be easier to ascertain which technology is superior Superiority should be defined in terms of competitive advantage Given that both IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>use a chalcogenide material the underlying technologies certainly have similarities However IMFTs crosspoint cell architecture makes Intels technology more competitive What makes Intels technology unique is its crosspoint cell architecture The architecture will not only allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to place billion memory cells in a gigabit chip using a crosspoint array but also ensure that each of these memory cells can be accessed in parallel This will result in reading and writing data at a phenomenal speed Clearly the crosspoint cell architecture is Intels competitive advantage Although each memory cell will store bit of data initially the crosspoint cell architecture will make Intels upcoming Optane SSDs superior to NAND and DRAM in terms of cost and speed respectively I am sure the memory cells will be able to store bits of data in future although further research is needed to achieve that However when that happens the SSDs will become far more costeffective The crosspoint cell architecture is Intels trump card In Micron was granted a patent that enabled IMFT to commercialize the D XPoint technology IBM is trying to challenge IMFT by placing more data in a cell and might be successful to seize Optanes market share to an extent In the long run though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will become the market leader by developing a way to store more data in a cell I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
