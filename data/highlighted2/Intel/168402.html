I Bought More <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>And It Came With Some Micron Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha A month ago I explained that I was looking to buy more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but couldnt decide if I should wait I decided that I should go ahead and buy more shares but in the process I found a strategy within the industry that might enhance my goals By leveraging the downturn in the chip market I decided to use Micron to play the turnaround in the industry With the reward outweighing the risk I have decided to use an appreciation in Micron shares to fund my continued accumulation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>A little less than a month ago I told readers that I was interested in adding more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC to my portfolio but was unsure if it was the right time to start accumulating I used several factors in determining my dilemma that really could have gone either way I left it up to my readers to discuss the facts and give me their opinion on the matter I was glad to see the discussion that ensued even though it wasnt anything earth shattering The most repeated advice was dollar cost averaging and with what my intentions are with my portfolio I was leaning toward buying more as I wrote the article but couldnt quite pull the trigger as I didnt know what the stock would do in the short to medium term However the resulting price action looked too good to pass up undoubtedly this was during the broad market downturn With my accumulation of INTC back in motion I couldnt help but allocate some to a very close stock but for different reasons I had been watching Micron NASDAQ MU from the sideline for some time and read much of what my fellow contributors had to say about its future To say the least the stock was and is highly divisive It was difficult to gauge the risk involved at first glance but I felt that at the levels it was dropping to that my reward far outweighed my risk Now I know my reasons for buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are different than what they are for Micron which Ill explain shortly but I felt like I was buying one to support the other and I dont mean market wise For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I had several reasons why I wanted to accumulate more shares and establish a larger position one of which was the dividend If anyone reading this article follows me then they know I share my Young Investors Portfolio which highlights the holdings I have and the goals of increasing dividends by using growth stocks and capital gains to fund the dividend payers That is primarily how I saw a larger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>holding fitting into my portfolio as a solid company that pays dividends On the other hand Micron might be the capital appreciation Im looking for to directly siphon off into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Micron may seem a little out there and be a dichotomic strategy with buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>even though they share the same industry mechanics I get it it doesnt pay a dividend it has been super volatile and above all its being hit the hardest in its industry as DRAM prices fall lower But thats exactly it by following <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>closely I couldnt help but see Micron in the background being brought lower and lower At the levels it was a few weeks ago it was hard not to initiate a position for no other reason than to ride the bottom back up Granted I didnt start a position in MU just because I thought I was finding a bottom Im not playing that game I had other reasons on a fundamental basis too My goal with Micron is to let the industry cycle back around and wait for an appreciation in the stock as sentiment has hit pretty low Ive read a lot of people saying buy when others are fearful and sell when others are greedy and I dont believe that the saying is entirely encompassing of managing a portfolio But I think it has some truth to it when applied correctly Thats what I think Im seeing with MU and how it has been down and out I want to take a closer look at the two and see if what Im setting up my portfolio to do will actually have the impact I intend Lets first take a look at the chart of Micron I bought shares of MU between August and August My only wish was that I bought more closer to the th and less near the th but I wont complain about market timing because since the th MU has been up However this shortterm gain could be wiped out and in fact I would welcome it so as to add more shares but I wont focus on the short term Historically speaking MU is sitting at undervalued levels as it trades at only a PE ratio I decided to get a better idea of what its relative to its own history and brought the FAST graphs tool out much like I did for my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>article This time I plan on using another tool in the arsenal in order to tell me what the expectations are for the future First the earnings graph Aside from the lumpy historical earnings we can see that MU is clearly below its normal PE ratio or even where it would be if growth is taken into account For the sake of being conservative I decided to also take a look at the forward looking graph and judging for myself that even if MU traded for half its typical earnings that it could still mean substantial upside I think the above chart tells an interesting story If MU were to change course toward its normal PE but only stop halfway at around it could still be worth to good for a appreciation from my cost basis Now of course I already can see the comments coming in that MU may never get back to historical levels and their earnings may be stagnant for way longer Thats OK I have time to wait Im not looking for a price reversion overnight or even next month Would I take that Sure The point is though that by buying in the low s my upside is greater than my downside especially after having gone through the recent market downturn The real key here is if Micron doesnt fall as far during this industry downturn where in previous downturns this wasnt the case If the estimates are to be believed it looks like Micron will be well above breakeven and will even see improvement in If thats how long it takes Im willing to hold on to my purchase The Two Stocks Working Together For Me Clearly as we would expect Micron leads the way in downside while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stays at a much steadier pace This is most likely due to the exposure each has to the DRAM and NAND chip market and the prices of those components What I see though is Micron having more downside protection built in at these levels while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is continuing to chug along not giving up a great deal in terms of investment This plays into my goals of using the greater upside potential of MU to fund a further investment into INTC and build up my dividend portfolio When I first was deciding if I was going to start an accumulation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>more than a month ago I figured I would just wait for a decent price and hit buy several times over the course of a few weeks I didnt expect to get more research time in with Micron than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and subsequently work on a strategy to capitalize on the industry cycle I plan on continuing to add more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as I see dips in stock price but I also plan on watching the industry more closely especially the one tied to Micron I feel the research I was aiming for actually led me to another opportunity in the same industry Both companies will fulfill different objectives toward my goal and I will watch through the end of the year how that plays out To my readers I appreciate your input in my decision to accumulate more share of INTC What is your opinion on this modified
