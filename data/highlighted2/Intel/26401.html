Seeking Alpha Stock looks fairly valued but sentiment is negative as expectations have fallen again Q consensus tough compared to s second quarter jump in PC biz INTCs capex nut like running a marathon with piano on your back The stock options could limit dividend growth INTC needs to option incentives less <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC the microprocessor giant reports its Q financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday April th Analyst consensus is expecting in earnings per share NYSEARCA EPS on billion in revenue for expected yearoveryear growth of in EPS and in revenue Given the preannouncement it surprised me that INTC was still going to show yy growth so the numbers were doublechecked and they are accurate Since the Jan earnings release the consensus EPS estimate has fallen from to while the consensus revenue estimate has fallen from billion to billion or a cool million The gross margin guide of was lowerthanexpected then and it will likely be lower when we see the results on Tuesday night Q consensus is expecting and for expected yearoveryear declines of in EPS on a revenue decline Remember it was late June where INTC preannounced positively on PC uptick thanks to Win XP reboot The positive preannouncement last June and then the negative preannouncement this midMarch demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that INTC is still tied to the PC cycle and that the other investments were maybe all for naught But INTCs bigger issue in my opinion is the billion capex requirement for fab investment for what is a dying PC segment or at least midsingledigit secular growth for the PC business which I have always likened to trying to run a marathon with a piano on your back Ins Sell shows the amount of insider selling relative to the share repurchase program Analytically it tells me how much of the share repo program is required just to prevent dilution from management selling stock options Just since or the last quarters INTCs capex has averaged of cash flow which is a heavy weight to bear You typically find that in the energy sector If I go all the way back to the average is Here are some other interesting facts From to INTC averaged revenue growth From to INTC averaged revenue growth From through which includes consensus estimates for through INTC is expected to average growth and that is distorted by and s revenue growth rates You can see why Brian Krzanich wanted to buy Altera NASDAQ ALTR Basically INTC is a business that the more product they can generate off that billion capex investment every year the more delta they can generate for EPS just the same as any business with high operating leverage or high degree of fixed costs There are other semi companies that have made this transition successfully but they did it another way ie they got out of the capex business but thats another article for another time With INTCs business model they need to generate better than revenue growth every year to satisfy shareholders Valuation INTC in the low s looks fairly valued as my estimate is closer to while Morningstars intrinsic value estimate is at and thus the average is The dividend yield at looks attractive but I think it could be capped since total dividend dollars is roughly of INTCs free cash flow and the most INTC can likely max that out at is of free cash given the stock options that have to be absorbed by the share repo plan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>like many of the tech giants has struggled to move away from its core competency and technologies The Altera acquisition will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>access to new markets and products although the deal looks to be off now Still I think INTC needs to eventually pursue something to reengineer the core technology away from microprocessors for PCs INTC has been a very frustrating long for many years and yet I think Brian Krzanich is a decent CEO capable of reengineering INTC as Satya Nadella is doing with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT So often in business a companys incredible strength becomes an incredible weakness as markets evolve technologies change and creative destruction occurs Here here and here are some of my earlier articles on INTC through the years This has been such a frustrating stock Source <span style='background-color:
