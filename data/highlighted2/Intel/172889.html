made Microsofts dividend yield grow to a compelling level Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has seen its share price decline over the last year Microsoft paid a quarterly dividend of for the last four quarters This gives Microsoft a trailing dividend yield of percent at the current share price Microsofts dividend has been raised regularly over the last years with four quarters at the same payout before the dividend was raised again Over the last five years the growth rates were the following The annual growth rate over the last five years was nineteen percent which is a great result for a company of Microsofts size In combination with Microsofts dividend yield of almost three percent this gives the company a Chowder number of which makes Microsoft a compelling pick for dividend growth investors Over the last few years the dividend policy has been to make the annual dividend hike with the dividend which is announced in September see Microsofts dividend history here it thus makes sense that Microsoft will increase its dividend again with the next dividend announcement in a couple of days Since Microsoft paid out four times the company will increase the payout again with its next dividend announcement the last increases were announced between September and September of the last four years We can thus assume that Microsofts next dividend payment will not be but more than that If Microsoft were to grow its dividend by percent the average over the last five years Microsofts next dividend payment would be rounded This would give the company a dividend yield of percent which would be great but I believe this is too optimistic As Microsofts last dividend increase was smaller than the previous ones I believe its appropriate to be conservative and to say that Microsoft will likely raise its dividend by again to per share per quarter for a dividend yield of percent at todays price Microsoft never pays fractions of one cent so the increase will be by a multiple of If Microsoft increased its dividend by or the dividend increase would be very low relatively speaking in comparison to Microsofts past dividend growth rate three percent six percent versus Microsofts last dividend hike of eleven percent A increase would equal a percent increase which is very close to Microsofts last dividend increase of eleven percent A increase would equal a growth rate of percent which is possible as well but less likely than a increase to as this would mean that Microsoft would increase its dividend growth rate again usually companies tend to lower their dividend growth rates over the years as the company matures so a percent increase vs percent in the previous year seems most likely A dividend yield of more than three percent still is very compelling as the broad markets yield is just percent and US bonds yield just percent Since Microsoft has a AAA rating buying the companys shares and holding them with a longterm horizon is a very low risk investment making the above market dividend yield even more compelling Microsofts cloud business has reached an annual run rate of billion and grew percent in the last quarter Microsoft is poised to become the number two cloud company after Amazon NASDAQ AMZN in IaaS Infrastructure as a Service and will become the clear PaaS leader Platform as a Service Gross margins for Microsofts cloud business are about percent thus higher than the company wide average of percent and will likely continue to grow Success in the cloud does not only means revenue growth for Microsoft but very profitable revenues Growing cloud revenues should provide a boost to Microsofts margins making the company more profitable over time Microsofts Bing keeps capturing market share and is about to become profitable for the first time Nadella said Bing will generate positive net income in fiscal which is very good news for investors Over the years Microsoft has spent a lot of cash and work on its search engine business while generating loss after loss with it As Bing will be profitable very soon Microsoft is not longer spending money on the segment but rather generating money from it which should be another positive for Microsofts bottom line Microsoft also has taken other steps to become more profitable Among the cost reduction initiatives are job cuts especially in the business acquired from Nokia which will lower Microsofts operating costs and thus raise margins and earnings Microsofts traditional PC business is in a good position as well PC sales which have been trending down for years are finally stabilizing Microsofts Windows and Intels NASDAQ INTC new Skylake processors are factors which motivate users to upgrade their PCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has said PC demand appears to have bottomed and PC sales are growing at very healthy rates in some countries eg Taiwan notebook sales were up percent in August on a month on month basis With global PC sales not shrinking but growing from now on this should be another boost to Microsofts top as well as bottom line It thus is not surprising that analysts see Microsoft earnings in the next fiscal year which is more than Microsoft has ever earned in the past Higher revenues higher margins through high margin growth in the cloud and cost cutting and the impact of a lower share count due to Microsofts stock buybacks will allow for substantial earnings per share growth in the next years With an expected dividend of quarterly Microsofts dividend payout ratio using for the annual dividend and for EPS would be slightly less than percent which is still very conservative a lot of blue chip stocks have higher dividend payout ratios As Microsofts business is not very cyclical and the company has a very clean balance sheet Microsoft could probably afford to pay out a higher portion of its earnings I used the interactive finbox valuation model to determine a fair value for Microsofts shares Even with conservative assumptions an exit EBITDA multiple which is below the peer group average and below Microsofts current EBITDA multiple revenue growth leveling of to just three percent in a short time Microsoft looks undervalued right now according to my calculations Microsofts fair value is about which implies low doubledigit upside for the company We also can use another way to determine whether Microsoft is undervalued right now the Gordon growth model Using Microsofts current dividend rate of a discount rate of nine percent and by putting in the current share price of as the fair value we can solve for g the required dividend growth rate we need to justify buying at todays price By solving g for g we get to a required dividend growth rate of percent This means When Microsoft raises its dividend by six percent annually in the future the companys shares trade at fair value right now If Microsoft raises its dividend faster its shares are undervalued right now if Microsoft raises its dividend by a lower pace its shares would be overvalued right now at least from an income investors point of view As Microsofts dividend growth rate has been a lot high in the past and since the analyst consensus sees Microsoft grow its earnings by percent annually over the next five years source a dividend growth rate of more than six percent seems very likely Microsoft is undervalued right now When we use Microsofts expected new dividend of per quarter or annually the required dividend growth rate drops down to percent which will be even easier to achieve Microsoft is about to raise its dividend and although we will probably not see a to percent hike a low doubledigit growth rate is likely As Microsofts shares are down over the last year the companys dividend yield became very attractive especially in an environment where low risk investments come with very low returns According to my calculations Microsoft is trading below fair value right now The companys shares thus look attractive for income investors ahead of another dividend increase Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MSFT over the next hours MoreI wrote
