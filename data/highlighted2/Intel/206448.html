Managements commentary provides key answers to questions Earlier this week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC announced third quarter results While there wasnt any groundbreaking news that I felt needed to be discussed I still wanted to provide an update Fellow SA contributor Anchorite recently provided a rather cautionary article on the name and I believe some of the points mentioned require further examination For those who dont have time to read the entire article here are the main points I want to address Even a billion sale of modems to Apple NASDAQ AAPL would be insignificant The stock buyback has slowed to a trickle In terms of Intels IoT business its still relatively small Through the first nine months of the segment contributed just to Intels overall revenues However at nearly yearoveryear growth the segment is growing faster than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a whole As far as Anchorites point about IoT being low margin the segment had an operating margin of through Q Thats just basis points lower than Intels overall operating margin While its not as profitable as the Data Center Group IoT is average and better than some of Intels other segments If the IoT segment can grow in the double digits going forward it should definitely represent a high singledigit percentage of the business by the end of the decade When looking at point two there are two things to think about business impact and market impact While a billion win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wouldnt be tremendous in terms of revenues I think it would have a somewhat significant impact in terms of Intels perception Over the past few years investors have been downtrodden regarding the chip giants failures in mobile Even if the business isnt that profitable just the announcement of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gaining a big Apple win should be significant to investors Just look at what happened back in March when we heard this initial rumor Some revenues are better than no revenues and this could lead to more partnerships down the road When it comes to contrarevenues management gave a bit of color on this situation on the conference call CEO Brian Krzanich stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is on track to improve mobile profitability by million this year CFO Stacy Smith stated that contrarevenues have mostly abated this year In the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was criticized for losing so much in mobile even as it began to rapidly increase CPU shipments Now volumes may be down but that leads to fewer losses Krzanich followed this up later in the call That said what we said around mobility is that on tablets we pretty much keep our share and our position in the market relatively equal to where it was and everybody sees tablets have shrunk this year as a category And so we have been careful about not chasing the bottom as prices drop figuring out where the value is where we can go in and make a little bit of money and actually add some innovation So youre going to see some tablets as we go towards the holidays with things like RealSense and that allow people new usages and new applications And as we go into you will see more of that With regard to the buyback the slowdown should not have been an earthshattering event Yes the Altera NASDAQ ALTR deal is a major part of this as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has borrowed billions to fund the deal When you are spending billion or so on a purchase for future growth that money has to come from somewhere I covered the financial aspect of this earlier this year where CFO Stacy Smith reiterated how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>uses its cash And just coming on the last part of your question John we as Brian said our priority is to invest in the business first dividend second and then we use the buyback to modulate cash balances In management saw extra cash on the balance sheet and put it to use through the buyback The dividend also was raised for As Anchorite pointed out in the article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did step up its buyback in Q buying billion worth of shares at prices quite a bit lower than the first half of this year The buyback is used to manage cash balances and so it shouldnt be looked at a primary item with regard to cash Id be much more worried if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt boost its dividend in than I would be if the buyback slows down This is especially true given the Altera purchase and managements statement that capex will likely be higher next year In fact investors might see a few positives in Intels report especially given the nice Q beat on the top and bottom lines One of the key items I discussed in my earnings preview was with regard to the stocks technicals As you can see in the chart below Intels earnings report was enough for the stock to stay above its day moving average That should likely provide support to shares until we get more clarity on in November While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>isnt firing on all cylinders currently I dont think investors should be overly cautious For those looking for answers management has provided a lot of commentary regarding contrarevenues and cash uses The IoT segment has potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>even if its not the companys largest business Also an Apple win would be great for mobile perception something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has struggled with in recent years Since Anchorites original article regarding caution with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares have lost about but thats a lot better than the roughly decline in the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ SOXX We only use
