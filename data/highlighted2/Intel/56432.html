Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article Learn more about PRO Storage and OTN spending are proving volatile but PMCSierra is wellplaced to benefit from a Grantleydriven storage cycle greater SSD adoption and upcoming OTN deployments PMCSierra is a highperformance niche specialist and that could appeal to several chip companies looking for defensible highmargin product revenues Todays valuation already seems reasonable by discounted free cash flow but the expected margin leverage can support an EVrevenue multiple that puts the stock in the mids These arent the best of times for the storage and carrier hardware industries but PMCSierra NASDAQ PMCS is looking to leverage new product introductions the move toward softwaredefined networking in the data center and a capex shift toward optical transport networking or OTN equipment to drive a meaningful upturn in revenue and further leverage in margins Midtohigh singledigit revenue growth and low doubledigit FCF growth can support todays stock price and the companys margins do argue for a higher revenue multiple than todays level Its also worth noting that acquisition activity has picked up in the chip space and PMCSierra would fit in with multiple suitors that have the wherewithal to make a deal I dont see a large discount to fair value here but the company has a legitimate opportunity to gain share in multiple markets and the company is still of a size where a few extra points of market share can drive meaningful extra value PMCSierra has a legitimate opportunity to drive meaningful revenue growth from the migration to G SAS controllers alongside the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Grantley server upswing and adoption of the companys SSD controllers but thats not going to be a seamless process Likewise with the transition toward OTN spending and PMCSierras processors Revenue rose yoy in the first quarter and fell sequentially led by the storage business which grew yoy even though this was hardly a banner quarter for large customers like EMC NYSE EMC and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ Optical was weaker though down yoy and PMCSierra saw a lot of the same weakness that undermined many chip companies with significant exposure to carrier spending For the very near term at least those challenges will remain Like so many of its peers though notably not rival Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM PMCSierra guided down for the second quarter The magnitude of the revision wasnt as bad about versus a peer average closer to but the range was rather wide down to up relative to Q and there are risks that the inventory correction in storage could drag on for a few more quarters andor that second half spending on OTN equipment doesnt pick up as hoped PMCSierra has multiple opportunity to grab share from Avago NASDAQ AVGO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Marvell NASDAQ MRVL in the storage space and leverage a meaningful upgrade cycle driven by Intels Grantley chips PMCSierras storage business has historically tracked the performance of Intels Data Center Group pretty closely so Id keep an eye on Intels performance as a bellwether for PMCSierras prospects PMCSierra already holds significant share in controllers but management thinks that the migration to G SAS could add points of market share Theres certainly a valid question as to whether that comes quickly say in the next couple of years or is a more extended process and Avago isnt going to surrender ground easily Flash controllers are likewise an opportunity for incremental revenue growth in the storage market The company has recruited three hyperscale data center customers and that should leave the company in good shape to register good growth later this year into and beyond Given that PMCSierras SSD controller business is aimed at the high end of the market I like the companys prospects for good margins and defensible market share gains PMCSierra didnt really cover itself in glory in the G market but the companys OTN processors look betterplaced for G To be sure management is not shy about expecting big things from this business as they are targeting share on the back of greater carrier commitments to OTN equipment PMCSierra has scored numerous design wins but thats only part of the battle The company has a lot writing on actual deployments by Chinese carriers and domestic carriers like Verizon NYSE VZ and communication capex orders can be frustratingly inconsistent and unpredictable Thats particularly true here of late with ATT NYSE T and Verizon reconsidering their capex plans in light of a move toward more regulation over broadband services PMCSierra has been a very willing acquirer over the years but may itself become a target in the notsodistant future This company tends to focus on highspec niche markets and the end result is that its not easy to swap out its products for rival offerings While that forces the company to spend considerable sums on RD and commit to long development timelines it also supports strong gross margins in excess of Highmargin products with highend capabilities and defensible market shares are appealing and I believe PMCSierra could be an appealing acquisition option for a range of companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Broadcom Marvell and Cavium NASDAQ CAVM Broadcom has publicly indicated that it is no longer pursuing largescale MA but management has also said that they wouldnt rule out the right sort of deal and PMCSierra would make a certain amount of sense as it would for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as well What would make PMCSierra consider a sale Should the storage and OTN spending cycles prove lumpier or longer than presently hoped that could lead to pressure on management to deliver more immediate satisfaction to shareholders Id also note that product development is getting more and more expensive in the chip space with many chip companies struggling to generate gross profit growth on par with RD spending growth Broadcom being one of the few to generally do so A sale at an attractive premium would be one way for management to sidestep that looming problem and a larger acquirer could look to leverage some RD synergies and cost savings Todays share price already seems to contemplate midhigh singledigit annualized revenue growth and a roughly fivepoint improvement in sustained FCF margins That level of performance is not out of the question if management hits its targets with the G SAS and OTN opportunities and I wont dismiss the possibility of outperformance from these businesses as well as other opportunities like a new radio head product Id also note that the shares can move up to about before trading at an EVrevenue multiple commensurate with the level of expected operating margins All of that said I dont see major undervaluation here There arent many cheap semiconductor stocks today or at least not outside of cheap for a reason and there is operational upside here but Id want a better price given the risk of a longer wait for the storage and OTN opportunities to
