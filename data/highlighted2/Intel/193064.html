Photoshop Fix App Exposes The Inadequacy Of Apples iPad Pro Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Adobes new Photoshop Fix iOS app reminds me again how disappointed I am with the iPad Pro ARMbased tablets will continue to remain as mere companion tools for laptopusing creative professionals Adobe will never be able to port a useful iOS version of its amazing Photoshop CC software to any ARMbased iPads I already made it clear before that an Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPad Pro will find it hard to attract serious consideration from creative professionals because of its lack of an x processor The argument that the iPad Pro cannot be justly compared to the Surface Pro is invalid These two expensive in tabletnotebooks are aimed toward the enterprise market They are therefore worthy of evaluation against each other By not using an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC processor Apple intentionally made the iPad Pro less usableinferior than the much cheaper Surface Apple likes to differentiate its products to maximize the revenue it can extract from its customers However the iPad Pros AX processor is still inadequate for enterprise users who depend on x only software Apple only wants MacBookusing professionals to buy the touchscreen iPad Pro as a companion tool not as a replacement for Mac laptops This greedy approach may not work well among corporate buyers who are on a fixed annual budget The iPad Pro is useless for serious design jobs due to its noncompatibility with important industry standard software It is just an expensive oversized iPad that somehow covers up Apples obvious refusal to release a touchscreen MacBook The inadequacy or lack of enterpriselevel usability of the inch iPad Pro is again highlighted by Adobes NASDAQ ADBE latest iOS photo editing app Photoshop Fix While others are gushing over this new mobile app from Adobe I find Photoshop Fix as a warning of how Apple intentionally crippled the iPad Pro I still do freelance graphic design jobs and Photoshop Fix is another embarrassment for Adobe It should stop releasing mobile apps that has the Photoshop name attached to it Photoshop Fix while better than Photoshop Express is still a million light years away from delivering even of the usability of the Mac OS X version of Photoshop CC Just look at the screenshot below Photoshop Fixs UI and tools are far from being truly satisfactory to creative professionals The computational limitation of an ARMbased processor makes it impossible for Adobe to port real Photoshop CC features to the iPad Pro One example of this limitation is Photoshop Fixs Healing Brush tool Forcing complicated x features on an ARMbased device sometimes leads to annoying results The Spot Heal tool of Photoshop Fix sometimes leaves a very noticeable artifact of the unwanted object that I tried to remove This is also the same problem when using the Clone Stamp tool On the other hand sometimes the Heal and Clone Stamp tools do work like they are supposed to They use pixel from nearby areas of the image to cover upremove unwanted objects However occasional glitches are unacceptable to professional designers on a tight deadline Try as it may Adobe and other software developers will never be able to create a port of their x software for iOS devices If only Apple would diverge from its habit of product differentiation an Intelpowered iPad Pro would have been a musthave tool every creative professional would have paid anything to own Product differentiation is not always suitable to all kinds of customers There are millions of iLoyalists who will not mind buying two Apple products that are just essentially just one item in terms of purpose However there will be some discerning potential buyers that will see through and reject Apples overzealous profiteering In the long run Apple will find it worthwhile to abandon its policy of never mixing iOS and Mac OS devices The iPad Pro will find it hard to win in the enterprise market against the Surface Pro and other Windows touchscreen hybrid laptops The iPad Pro rightfully deserves to be upgraded beyond the limitations of ARMbased processors and iOS apps I opine that it would be better for Apple in the longrun if it sacrifices the nontouchscreen MacBook in favor of a Mac OS X version of the iPad Pro This enterprisecentric tablet only needs an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x processor to make it a real equalizer to the Surface Pro The bigger risk now is that Apple will not only have semiattractive iPad Pro but it might also see its MacBook business decline from the rising popularity of the Surface There are now cheaper copycat versions of the Surface Pro already The obvious advantage and cost savings of a real touchscreen tabletnotebook hybrid appeals to all consumers not just corporate users The current iPad Pro has a limited appeal It is just a companion tool for the MacBook It is an optional not a necessary gadget for professionals Ergo the iPad Pro is unlikely to help reverse the declining sales of the iPad product line We only use your contact details to reply to your request
