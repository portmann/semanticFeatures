growth of Chinese brands such as Oppo and Vivo represent a boost to chipset sales by Qualcomm Recent analysis from Counterpoint Research indicates that Apple NASDAQ AAPL lost market share in China in Q while four Chinese smartphone makers gained share Based on Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM presence in the Chinese makers phones Apples market share loss in China may be Qualcomms gain Bloomberg published the Counterpoint Research results highlighting the rise of the local Chinese makers Huawei Xiaomi Private XI Vivo and Oppo These are now the top four smartphone makers in China with a combined market share of Apple is in fifth place with a market share of a decline from a year ago These results may not represent much of a change from Q however as theyre very consistent with what Strategy Analytics reported for Q The top four Chinese vendors in Q market share stood at while it was a year ago The growing strength of the Chinese brands represents a continuing challenge for Apple but at least the data suggests stabilization since Apples share remains about Whether Apple can turn the situation around with the release of iPhone in calendar Q remains open to question Part of the reason that Apple lost share in China this year is that the Chinese makers fielded a number of highly competitive Android phones that featured Qualcomm processors including the flagship Snapdragon quite possibly the best smartphone processor currently available With the rise of the new Chinese makers Vivo and Oppo has come stronger representation for Qualcomms processors in the Chinese branded handsets In order to quantify that representation I surveyed the global sites of the four brands in order to determine the percentage of phones using Qualcomm processors With the exception of Xiaomi the brands continue to feature a bewildering array of device models often including legacy models from several years back For that reason I also separately report the Qualcomm processor percentage for newer better selling devices The Qualcomm market share is weighted by the Strategy Analytics market share for Q assuming that its a good approximation of the market share for Q The top four Chinese vendors combined give Qualcomm a share of the market for Q My main reason for going long on Qualcomm in addition to Apple was that I saw the companies as being complementary in market strategy Qualcomm represents the traditional commodity processor approach applied to smartphones Qualcomm operates through OEMs selling chipsets rather than whole devices Apple represents the newer paradigm of integrated device maker that designs its own processors and also the operating system and device Huaweis relatively low utilization of Qualcomm is a consequence of its embracing of the Apple paradigm For the most part its flagship devices use its own custom designed Kirin processors In addition Huawei is reportedly even working on its own mobile operating system bringing it closer to the Apple model However the rapid rise of Oppo and Vivo required an application of the commodity model which was made to order for Qualcomm In investing in Qualcomm Im acknowledging that there will likely be a commodity component to the overall smartphone market for some time In case the commodity component of the smartphone market grows at Apples expense Qualcomm represents a reduction of that risk Given what Huawei is doing its not absolutely clear that the commodity model will be triumphant either in China or globally Some believe that the Peoples Republic of China PRC is out to drive Apple from the marketplace and cite various regulatory actions that have been taken I actually think Qualcomm represents a good counter argument Qualcomm has been put through the regulatory ringer in China It reached an settlement of anticompetitive business practices with the PRC that has allowed it to continue to do business in China As difficult as the process was Qualcomm was clearly not driven out of China Theres a certain stereotype of the PRC in the West that its a lawless Communist dictatorship While the Communist Party represents the most powerful political institution in China it has not been able to undo centuries of Chinese culture which embraced the rule of law in government Confucianism The idea that the PRC is going to toss aside its international trade agreements and membership in the World Trade Organization in order to drive Apple or any other US company out of China is ridiculous Qualcomm is living proof of that Unfortunately the market share data is a little fuzzy making it difficult to come up with an exact estimate for chipset shipments NYSE MSM by Qualcomm to Chinese OEMs If Counterpoints data holds up and if the smartphone market hasnt declined too dramatically then this amounts to about million units in Q This assumes about million smartphone shipments in the quarter In Q smartphone shipments were million according to Strategy Analytics Qualcomm guided to MSM shipments for the June quarter Qualcomm will probably get a boost from Chinese OEMs but this may be counterbalanced by the reported partial loss of Apples modem business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I continue to be skeptical about the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem reports since I dont think it would make sense for Apple Growth in China this quarter could lead to a surprise to the upside in MSM shipments and revenue Samsungs OTCSSNLF earnings prerelease also suggests some good news in the offing for Qualcomm Samsung reported that operating profit rose by yy Most is attributed to its mobile division but its foundry business has been strong recently as well Qualcomm is fabricating its newest Snapdragon processor on the Samsung nm node The presence of the on some models of the Galaxy S as well as most other Android flagship devices is also a plus for Qualcomm The good news from Samsung combined with China encourages me that Qualcomm will do well this quarter I continue to be long Qualcomm and rate it a buy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for
