NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels upcoming Denverton SoCs will have significant enhancements compared to the current Atom C server chip family <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to monopolize the evolving microserver market with its low power chips eliminating ARMbased chips from microservers After AMD exiting the SeaMicro business earlier this year ARMs job to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is far more difficult now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is planning to launch its next generation nm Atom SoCs in the second half of codenamed Denverton and DenvertonNS intended for the microserver and the adjacent networking markets respectively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will replace its current Atom C server chip family codenamed Avoton and Rangeley by introducing Denverton which will be marketed under Atom Cxxx model number Some details of the Denverton SoCs are now available reports CPU World which reveals that the SoCs will have cores compared to its predecessors along with many other significant enhancements Sadly the site has removed the details at Intels request which makes the case even stronger Although its widely expected that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will move to the Goldmont microarchitecture for Denverton a tock in Intels ticktock cadence nothing concrete regarding this is available yet However its now clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is targeting to monopolize the growing microserver market with its nextgeneration Atom chips by throwing tough competition to ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH ARMbased chips The growth potential of this market is significantly higher compared to the rest of the server market Unlike midrange generalpurpose servers microservers are designed for specific and relatively light computing workloads such as workloads related to web content and online services With predefined workloads its possible to use a microserver in such a way that unused resources remain at a minimum level In this way microservers can be made much more efficient In addition microservers can be significantly cheaper compared to midrange servers since they dont need to be run by higherend processors like Intels Xeon with Wplus TDP Instead an Atom SoC with a TDP of W or less is enough to run the microservers Going forward the microservers will be used for diversified workloads As a result the microserver market will see huge growth opportunities According to a report The total value for global market microserver stood at USD million in and it is estimated that the market would reach a size of USD million by It is estimated that the market would experience growth at a CAGR of in terms of revenue during the period from to Further it has been estimated that a total of thousand units of microserver would be shipped in By contrast the overall server market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over the period according to another report With the upcoming launch of Denvertonbased Atom SoCs coupled with the newly launched nm Broadwellbased Xeon D <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to grow its microserver market share by outcompeting archrival ARM Holdings After AMD NASDAQ AMD exiting the SeaMicro dense server business earlier this year Intels job is far less difficult now AMD acquired SeaMicro three years ago It had big plans for the microserver business with its future ARMbased processors which came to an end rather abruptly with the demise of SeaMicro Currently Applied Micro Circuits NASDAQ AMCC XGene and Cavium Networks NASDAQ CAVM ThunderXbased ARM CPUs are Intels prime competitor in the microserver market However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is set to monopolize the microserver market with its nm Xeon D and upcoming Denverton If ARM were to profit from the upcoming boom in this market a strong software ecosystem is needed to be built around its processors as early as in the next couple of years Both Applied Micro and Cavium are producing CPUs in nm nodes and they are not in a position to offer customers nm chips anytime soon They can at best offer nm chips using Globalfoundries FDSOI technology Using the FDSOI technology which has the potential to deliver FinFETlike performance and energy efficiency would enable the companies to compete with Intels nm chips in terms of power and performance to a limited extent However if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>moves to the Goldmont architecture for Denverton instead of Airmont as previously expected competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be far more difficult As far as building software support is concerned Linux compatibility based on SUSE Linux Enterprise which has been made available to both Applied Micro and Cavium is a giant step for ARMbased processors to succeed in the server space in the long run Further the Linaro Enterprise Group is developing a full Linux stack for ARM which is also encouraging However I strongly believe that building a workable software ecosystem will take at least three to five years and a fullfledged ecosystem will take a decade As a result ARM will miss the first phase of the microserver boom which will end in the next fourfive years Although I believe that ARM will lose the first round of the microserver battle I strongly believe it will comeback with a vengeance post not only in the microserver space but in the broader server market as well By then the ARM ecosystem will be built and many new players will start chip production such as Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM the latter of which is going to be taken over by Avago Technologies NASDAQ AVGO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might have a tough time then We only use your contact details to
