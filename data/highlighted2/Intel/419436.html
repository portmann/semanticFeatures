after its big earning surprise on April after the close I was tempted to buy the shares considering that they were still below their high of just five years ago upside and were far below their high of Plus AMD is the secondlargest maker of personal computer microprocessors after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC which told me the company would likely not die anytime soon But with a quick look at the data from Finviz I decided to wait The average analysts price target was and the technical graph showed resistance about Further the lack of PE ratios PEG ratios and estimated earnings per share EPS growth for the next five years raised red flags The price did fall to an intraday low of on Monday and stayed within a range of and for about days During that day period investors seemed to think the stock should not fall below but was worth more than In stock jargon this looked like a consolidation phase Lengthy periods of consolidation are often known as a base Finally on May the stock broke out and surged over days Using the same logic as above it seems that the stock could fall to about the resistance shown in the graph below The average analysts price target was raised to but this number also indicates the price could fall Institutional ownership fell from to which means that some institutions sold their stakes in the company and probably think the stock will fall The quarteroverquarter EPS growth slowed from to The graph below also says the stock will fall but the rounded bottom technical pattern says that the stock will fall to about instead of The target price is the distance between the base of the curve and the rim projected over the top of the rounded bottom cup The MFI Money Flow Index is The RSI Relative Strength Index is The Stochastic K is And the WR is All of these are overbought which means the stock has a high probability of falling And the last time the MFI RSI Stochastic K and WR were at similar levels the price fell On the plus side the EPS growth estimate for next year was raised from to Short float also fell from to meaning some short sellers are covering and probably think the shares will rise While AMD may fall in the short term is the stock a good longterm investment As mentioned in the beginning that high of just five years ago looks to be close to the longterm average as shown in the stocks longterm graph shown below So we could say the stock may rise back up to its longterm average of Based in Sunnyvale California the billion global semiconductor manufacturer was founded in and became the only significant rival to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the market for xbased microprocessors The x line of microprocessors are central processing units CPUs such as the Pentium series made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs are the heart of every computing device and basically process the instructions of computer programs The x line provided a framework of how processors should carry out those instructions In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>introduced the microprocessor which became the industry standard The founders of both AMD and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>left Fairchild Semiconductor NASDAQ FSC in the s to form their own semiconductor companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>created the first microprocessor in beating AMD When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>began installing microcode in its microprocessors in it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with AMD granting AMD a copyright license to the microcode Due to pressure from IBMs NYSE IBM PC business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>entered into a year technology exchange agreement with AMD starting in where each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer for semiconductor products developed by the other Starting in AMD introduced its own CPU chip and began to compete directly with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>After spinning off its flash business to raise cash AMD acquired ATI Technologies in for billion in cash and million shares of stock or approximately billion Since acquiring ATI in AMD and its competitor Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA have dominated the discrete graphics processor unit GPU market Over the years AMD had lost market share to competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia in the CPU market and the discrete graphic processing units GPU market As of the second quarter Nvidia claimed over of the worldwide GPU market while AMDs market share fell to As of the first quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>claimed about of the worldwide CPU market while AMDs market share fell to about The hope is that as the company launches new products it can regain lost market share Further it plans to monetize its patent portfolio in return for a royalty fee On April the company surged after it reported first quarter results that beat on earnings and revenue For the quarter ending March EPS was on million in revenue compared to EPS of on billion in revenue a year ago Analysts had expected EPS of on million in revenue Thus despite beating analysts estimates EPS loss widened by year over year and revenue fell over the same period Falling revenue and a widening EPS loss does not seem to be good news in my opinion But the company also mentioned that it signed a million licensing agreement with a Chinese investment group to develop SystemonChip SoCs tailored to the Chinese server market The company also said its gross margins rose to from the previous quarter due primarily to a richer product mix and the mix of revenue between business segments Despite a decrease in revenue quarter over quarter and a decrease in revenue year over year the companys computing and graphics segments operating loss fell from million in the fourth quarter to million in the first quarter This was also less than the operating loss of million a year ago primarily due to lower operating expenses This tells me that the company is strengthening its product line and decreasing their operating expenses which could lead to higher revenues and eventually profitability The company also expects billion in future revenue for three new gaming processors over the next three or four years But the three SoC drivers of this future revenue are not developed yet At least one is scheduled to be in production by the second half of this year with all of those SoCs launching by One of these SoCs is rumored to be in the new Sony NYSE SNE PlayStation AMD dominates graphics chips for the nextgeneration gaming consoles providing chips for Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Xbox One the PlayStation and Nintendos Wii U Over the next few years virtual reality VR is expected to boost demand for graphics chips which could be a huge catalyst to AMD The company is positioning itself to take a leadership role Its VR platform Radeon Pro Duo GPU was selected by th Century Fox New Regency Ubisoft Motion Pictures and VR development studio Practical Magic to bring the upcoming ASSASSINS CREED movie VR experience to life The companys collaboration with the Associated Press to create a VR experience channel for the nextgeneration of journalism could provide an additional steam of revenue Computing Solutions Primarily includes x microprocessors chipsets embedded processors and dense servers Graphics and Visual Solutions Primarily includes graphics processing units GPUs semicustom SystemonChip SoC products and technology for game consoles After July the company realigned its organizational structure and started reporting under two new segments Computing and Graphics Primarily includes desktop and notebook processors chipsets discrete GPUs and professional graphics Five customers accounted for approximately of the net revenue Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom segment Primarily includes server and embedded processors dense servers semicustom SystemonChip SoC products development services and technology for game consoles Five customers including Sony and Microsoft accounted for approximately of the net revenue The company gave a semirosy forecast For the second quarter it forecasts revenue to rise from the first quarter to million The company did not give an EPS forecast Analysts are expecting EPS of on million in revenue The midpoint of the companys revenue forecast is million which is slightly above analysts revenue estimates For full year fiscal the company had EPS of on billion in revenue compared to EPS of on billion in revenue a year ago For full year fiscal analysts are expecting EPS of on billion in revenue As can be seen in the revenue and expenses graph above revenue reached a trough in the first quarter of and the second quarter of Thus it is probably true that revenue will trough in the first quarter of as analysts estimate Also notice that the gap between total expenses and revenue is decreasing Thus the company could see a profit in the near future From the yearoveryear graph it can be estimated that the company would either see a continued fall in revenue or a reversal higher It is also encouraging to see that the computing and graphics segment has finally started to see increasing revenue after being in decline since Conclusion Thus I would say AMD is a longterm buy Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in AMD over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
