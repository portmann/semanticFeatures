sales Analysts see Apple selling between M and M iPad Pros for the quarter which would be an excellent milestone given the price and small revenues from the Microsofts Surface Regardless of sales whats important is that the iPad Pro serves as a powerful enabling device that could yield serious applications that were never possible on iPad This would foster a strong foundation for the future of all iPads which will allow consumers and enterprises to progressively perceive the iPad as a genuine PC replacement The highly anticipated iPad Pro has hit Apples NASDAQ AAPL shelves and one big question is whether it will be the exit door from collapsing iPad sales Analysts are expecting that just M to M iPad Pros will sell during the quarter but Seeking Alpha contributor Mark Hibben calls these estimates too modest adding that the big brother tablet is Apples most important personal computing device since the Macintosh which does have some truth to it Even though iPad sales fell last quarter Apples shares still rallied to postearnings Theres no question that the iPad is losing its importance among investors but the upside potential just cant be ignored Its enormous and can be achieved through effective cannibalization of the PC market and Tim Cook feels confident that iPad Pro can do just that This makes investing in Apple quite difficult especially when you consider a crosssection of recent Seeking Alpha analysis Technology editor Rocco Pendola questioned Tim Cooks music approach and contributors such as Alex Cho have downgraded their recommendations to holds noting of huge iPhone sales decreases to come Even Ive written that the Macs decadelong growth streak could come to an end by as soon as the next two quarters It is clear that Apple has become a questionable investment but hopefully this article helps you come to a better decision with an emphasis on iPad Pro and the future of iPad To start Id like to arm you with some basic facts about iPad sales specifically when compared to the Mac and iPhone In Apples most recent earnings iPad revenue fell a dramatic YOY in both revenue and unit shipments This made iPad revenue a mindboggling lower than the Mac and lower than the iPhone For the same period a year ago iPad was just below the Mac In the period iPad revenue was actually greater than the Mac and was only lower than the iPhones revenue With even this basic information it is easy to conclude that iPad revenue isnt contracting its collapsing it has hit a wall not the speed bump that Tim Cook has repeatedly referred to Although Apples stock has rallied significantly in spite of this investors still arent too happy about it as it increases the risk of owning Apple However Tim Cook is still adamant that the iPad Pro can replace the notebook for many many people and that users will conclude that they no longer need anything else other than their iPhone Will we find out if Tim Cook was right in January Ive had the chance to spend some time with the iPad Pro and I find it easy to conclude that its an excellent tablet Its big without being too heavy Its incredibly snappy utilizes an excellent stylus and features the best sound system Ive ever heard in a tablet or MacBook The biggest con is the and price tags for the nonupgradable respective GB and GB versions Im sure Apple is using extremely fast highquality storage but most would think that a desktop replacement would come with a little more storage I find that many customers will question Apples PC replacements with such configurations Furthermore I believe that most individuals just arent ready to replace their notebooks and desktops with tablet PCs yet The Surface has been attempting to replace the notebook since and in spite of Windows having the lions share of PC users it still only generated M in sales last quarter That would be about iPad Pros which sort of makes the M unit target set by analysts an excellent milestone to reach Whats really important about the iPad Pro In Mark Hibbens iPad Pro analysis he wrote that the greatest factor in improving iPad sales has already arrived iOS with multitasking Although I agree that this helps I find that its not as important as the most important AX processor the Apple Pencil and the larger screen of the new iPad Pro These are three items that will work together as enablers for the future of iPad which will over time help morph iOS into an operating system that almost anyone can trust to replace their PC Lets look at some recent iPad Pro benchmarks that have surfaced As Apple promised the AX has proven itself as almost twice as fast as the really quick iPad Air but benchmarks are also adding that its faster than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Core m chip in the Surface Pro Even the singlecore computing the iPad Pro matches the upgraded Core i in the Surface Pro This is huge because were comparing the AX a passivelycooled tablet ARM NASDAQ ARMH chip to the Core i an activelycooled laptopgrade processor Because of this going forward you will find that the Surface Pro will never be able to compete with the iPad in form factor weight and battery life unless it can use a more efficient fanless processor Now I wrote earlier that the AX processor is the most important factor in boosting iPad sales and you may be wondering why The quick answer is apps PCs for example have generally taken a topbottom approach when it comes to programs Sophisticated applications would surface on the desktop and then notebooks would simply improve until theyre capable of running those apps The iPad on the other hand has taken a bottomup approach because developers have never been able to work with a powerful iPad or a desktop with virtually no computing limit Because of this developers have had to work within the progression of ARM processors but with the rapid chip improvements that Apple has made with the iPad Pro we will begin to see a rise of bigboy apps This will take time but as these complex desirable and important apps surface requiring more horsepower I think we will find that two very desirable things will happen to iPad First individuals will begin to genuinely accept the iPad as a true PC replacement And second iit will finally turn older iPads which are still very capable today into obsolete machines for those who desire more sophisticated uses for their iPad With collapsing iPad sales investors have set their eyes on the new iPad Pro The new tablet will certainly play an important role at Apple but not through the direct sales boost that many are hoping for Its unlikely that itll be a breakout product and investors should be delighted if iPad Pro achieves analysts million unit estimates because that means the big tablet alone would generate up to three times Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Surface revenue from last quarter Regardless whats really important is that iPad Pro acts as a springboard for the future of all iPads to come The AX chip Pencil which will come to iPad Air eventually and bigger screen act as a whole new playground for developers We will see a whole new selection of apps surface not just any apps but powerful and sophisticated programs that would otherwise be impossible for iPad iOS developers have an excellent reputation for their creativity and IBM NYSE IBM Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Adobe NASDAQ ADBE among others are collaboratively working with Apple to provide the appropriate apps that can morph iPad into the ideal tablet PC that consumers and enterprises need Does this make Apple a buy today at the very same I recommended avoiding it at several weeks ago In my opinion probably not As mentioned falling iPad sales have been ignored by investors and should larger revenue sources such as iPhone and Mac become depressed shares could come under pressure I will personally hold off for now but believe I will become an
