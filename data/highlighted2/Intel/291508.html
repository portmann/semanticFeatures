myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>posted stagnant revenue and a decline in operating income The Client Computing Group continues to be weighed down by mobile device losses In his prepared remarks for the Q earnings conference call Intels NASDAQ INTC CEO Bryan Krzanich claimed a strong finish to the year But gone was last years bravado regarding the mobile space Gone was any mention of tablet processor sales SoFIA Intels partnerships with Rockchip and Spreadtrum or even Intels wireless modems Intels capitulation on mobile sounds a warning for investors regarding Intels fundamental business model As previewed at Intels Investor Meeting last November Intels management is focused and would like to focus investor attention on three key areas of growth the data center the Internet of Things IOT and nonvolatile memory On the surface this seems sensible because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has high hopes for D Xpoint memory and the Data Center Group DCG and IoT Group ITG both posted revenue gains for Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>eked out a slight revenue gain for the quarter of yy to billion However even the bastions of DCG and ITG showed signs of strain While revenue was up for the quarter operating income was down for both Total operating income for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was down yy for the quarter For the year revenue declined by yy to billion while operating income declined by yy to billion Client Computing Group CCG faced with the ongoing decline in worldwide PC sales continued its relentless decline For Q revenue was down by about while operating income was down by year over year These yearoveryear comparisons are for restated revenue and operating income assuming the combination of the PC Client Group and the Mobile and Communications Group MCG That combination of the PCCG and MCG at the beginning of the year continues to obscure but not completely conceal Intels continuing mobile losses which were once again acknowledged during the conference call An analyst asked if the goal of an million reduction in mobile losses was still the goal for and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acknowledged that it was Comparing the operating costs of the combined Client Computing Group and the old PC Client Group provides insight into the magnitude of the losses associated with mobile as the chart below shows Despite comparable revenue to the old PCCG operating income for CCG continued to lag compared to last year by about you guessed it a billion dollars Intels claims of making progress in reducing mobile losses are beginning to look rather specious Up until Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was at least making progress in getting operating costs under control The jump in operating cost for Q reflects the billion in operating loss for the mobile group that it was posting quarterly throughout Why operating cost jumped in Q erasing the gains of the previous quarters appears to be due to a reversal of Intels reduction in contra revenue for Q as well as expenses due to modem development <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reported selling million tablet processors in the quarter This was actually a sequential increase from the previous quarter of million units although a decline of yy Probably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>decided to boost tablet sales in Q to clear out inventory Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has claimed that nonvolatile memory represents a growth area for the company theres no discernible profit as the memory effort is lumped into the All Other category which posted a loss of million for Q on revenue of million An analyst asked if memory output from the planned Chinese factory would be a positive contributor to EPS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acknowledged that it wouldnt be in It wasnt until an analyst specifically asked about it that Intels modem effort was even mentioned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stated that the modem is being sampled to potential customers but didnt give any indication of the magnitude of adoption I personally doubt that adoption will be high with Qualcomm already fielding superior modems and having an incumbency advantage After the Investor Meeting I described <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as being in retreat in mobile devices but the lack of mention of Intels mobile devices seems more than mere retreat In fact I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management has simply realized that its never going to be competitive with ARMbased processors for smartphones and lightweight tablets The smartphone industry continues to embrace the paradigm shift away from commodity processors produced by companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to custom designed systems on chip SOCs The industry is following Apples NASDAQ AAPL lead not Intels retro PC industry fantasy The latest example of this is the recently released Huawei Mate smartphone Even I as an Apple fan and investor have to acknowledge that the Mate is a really nice phone It runs Android and features the HiSilicon Kirin SOC The Kirin is a custom SOC featuring the latest ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH CortexA CPU core design HiSilicon is a wholly owned subsidiary of Huawei The custom SOCs from Samsung and Hauwei clearly demonstrate that the industry now understands the value of Apples custom SOCs that it began designing back in There is no turning back the clock to the PC commodity era for the smartphone industry Commodity processors still have a place as Qualcomm has shown but only in medium priced and lower devices But even in this price tier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cant compete with Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM latest Snapdragon Theoretically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still plans to move SoFIA now fabricated by TSMC on a nm process to its own nm process this year I frankly doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will bother There is no market for it The Kirin also serves to demonstrate why Intels modem strategy will fail The already has incorporated HiSilicons own modem technology The industry is moving to integrated modems with Apple as one of the few laggards in this regard but I doubt that will last much longer Apple will probably license Qualcomms modem technology for its next generation SOC I have for some time advocated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>embrace the PC mobilization strategy of Microsoft focusing on mobile form factors for Wintel based PCs Microsofts latest Surface Pro and Surface Book are great examples of this Clearly theres a huge market of Windows PC users that can be mined for upgrades The failure in smartphones should give investors pause regarding the longevity and ultimate success of this strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>failed in smartphones and tablets because of a basic cost disadvantage compared to ARM that it simply couldnt overcome even with contra revenue Doesnt that cost disadvantage eventually carry over into the other markets served by CCG and DCG I think it does Its already having an impact on client computing as consumers simply dont bother to upgrade their Wintel PCs For these consumers smartphones and tablets are performing most of their daytoday computing As these devices become more powerful and able to connect to large screen HD and even UHD displays they make inroads in traditional PC strongholds such as productivity and even entertainment interactive and non These days you can watch UHD movies or play games on an ARM processor device whether located in your smartphone or a compact console such as the Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Shield Console Given the declines in the market for traditional PCs and the growing power of smartphones Im now very skeptical that Microsoft will ever achieve its goal of billion PCs running Windows Furthermore the reported revamping of Android as a mobile and PC platform appears to set up Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL to take advantage of ARM processors to become the next commodity PC platform supplier The data center appears safe for now and I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to protect it ferociously but I expect that eventually it will succumb as well Here the key to reducing Intels share of the market will probably be companies such as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN that have the ability to design ARM processors through its Anapurna subsidiary combined with a huge internal market for servers and the ability to control the software stack that runs on the servers Apple could also do this What happened with smartphones is really a death knell for the x architecture The death of x may be painful and protracted but it looks increasingly certain Altera offers a faint glimmer of hope in that Altera designed and built some ARMbased combination processorFPGA devices as I pointed out in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Becomes An ARM Chip Maker But theres still no sign that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management is willing to be flexible regarding choice of instruction set architecture for its key products This may come eventually but until then I consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a sell Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
