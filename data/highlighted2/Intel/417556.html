Intels SSF platform is actually a Gbsec solution comprising of PCIe adapters processors memory storage switches cables and management software According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the SSF platform offers a port switch which supports more servers at less power consumption compared to an InfiniBand solution of equivalentcost Intels move to acquire InfiniBand from QLogic was aimed at accessing the router technology for establishing its dominance in HPC Mellanox NASDAQ MLNX the only InfiniBand vendor left in the marketplace has been offering its Gbsec solution based on a port SwitchIB switch for running EDR enhanced data rate ports SwitchIB offers InfiniBand routing capabilities with unlimited scalability Its noteworthy here that Oracle NYSE ORCL has started making InfiniBand switches and adapters for own and thirdparty use Intels OPAdriven SSF platform will compete against Mellanoxs Gbsec EDR platform For overcoming the bottlenecks todays HPC operators face as a result of processesdriven parallelism EDR provides an innovative offloading technology The technology relies on intelligent interconnect solutions for accelerating process communications Mellanox believes Intelligent interconnect solutions are becoming the new coprocessors and they are therefore becoming a key factor for scalable computing However Intels SSF is embracing a holistic approach to overcome the performance bottlenecks caused by parallelism achieved by increasing number of processes The approach involves continually upgrading new technologies and building a software platform to integrate the technologies In contrast Mellanoxs approach revolves around designing complex offloading interconnect solutions compatible with competitor Intels processors which is indeed a difficult task Intels approach is not only more viable compared to that of Mellanox but also profitable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a chip maker and its quite natural that it wants to sell more chips as the world progresses toward exascale The exascale timeline may have been extended but for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>thats nothing more than business as usual And business as usual in this context means generating revenues consistently How Well since deploying OPA needs customers to continually upgrade processors memory storage and software as mentioned above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to make money Intels OPA is gaining popularity with leading institutions adding OPA to their HPC infrastructure despite Mellanoxs EDR InfiniBand continues to offer performance advantage which is temporary This is certainly encouraging from the point of view of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders Why leading institutions are embracing OPA With Intels Knights Landing technology in the form of Xeon Phi processors along with D XPoint memory technology in the form of Optane SSDs getting ready to give tomorrows HPC workloads a performance boost the institutions are certainly feeling more comfortable with Intels SSF approach compared to Mellanoxs approach A new study presented at the th IEEE International Parallel Distributed Processing Symposium IPDPS being held in Chicago suggested that FPGAs could play an important role in exascale computing in terms of performance boost The authors of the study said The reconfigurability of existing hardware resources in the FPGA architecture exposes a new type of tradeoffs between the hardware resources versus throughput such as compute unit replication kernel vectorization resource sharing heterogeneous memory support loop unrolling streaming and channels Intels strides toward exascale computing will unfold new chip technologies Meanwhile IBM NYSE IBM announced earlier this month that it has advanced one step further toward exascale computing and perhaps beyond with its quantum computing approach Theoretically quantum computers can be exponentially faster than classical computers and IBM expects to build a mediumsized quantum chip of qubits quantum bits within the next decade I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and IBM are the only two companies in the world developing new
