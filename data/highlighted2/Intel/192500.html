class='textDiv'>Dear Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Can Build Your Android One Phone Google Inc NASDAQGOOGL Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now helping vendors like Cherry Mobile Create sub Android phones Spreadtrum in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a stake is also helping vendors create Firefox OS smartphones Due to Apples enthusiastic support for mobile browser ad blocking on iOS devices Google has an urgent need for greater Android One phone sales The Android One project was intended to expand the mobile advertising channels of Google NASDAQ GOOGL The pure Android OS in Android One phones was to guarantee that no Android OEM partners will try to steal advertising eyeballs from Google The enthusiastic support of Apple NASDAQ AAPL for iOS Safari ad blocking makes it more urgent for Google to further increase the presence of Android One smartphones in the world While Google sells premium handsets stock Android OS phones like the Nexus it also tried to popularize Android One handsets in India last year Unfortunately the MediaTekpowered Android One phones from Googles OEM partners in India failed to attain commercial success The low market appeal of stock Android OS phones prompted Google to reboot its plan The company now intends to propagate Android One phones with price tags The problem now is MediaTek has yet to offer a processor to make it possible for Android One phone manufacturers to meet the new Suggested Retail Price SRP of Google While Micromax and Spice agreed to play minions to Googles Android One ambition those two Indiabased firms will find it very hard to make a profit in selling stock Android OS handsets Unless Google offers Micromax cash incentives or ad revenue sharing there is no compelling reason for the latter to support the Android One idea Even if MediaTek supplies super cheap processors Micromax would still rather sell its own brand of Android phones and get paid by thirdparty companies to preinstall their apps This is more financially viable than giving Googles Android One project a free ride The better solution therefore is for Google to ask for help from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Like its approach with the Nexus Google will just have to go allin on its Android One phone project Google only needs to hire one or two subcontractors to build its own Android phone LG OTCLGEAF or Huawei could assemble the Google phone and use Intels supercheap Atom x processors Im proud to report that my countrys biggest smartphone vendor Cherry Mobile has teamed up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to create an Android phone using the Genabled Atom x processor The Cherry Mobile MAIA Fone i has an SRP of only pesos Cherry Mobile is Googles official partner for Android phones here in the Philippines After the initial success of the first carrierbacked Cherry Mobile One Android One handset Google asked Cherry Mobile to release the more expensive G Android One handset last month Google also recently launched the BQ Aquaris A Android One smartphone in Spain and Portugal I support its move to offer higherpriced Android One handsets However I still say the company has a compelling reason to make its Android One phone a reality The more people that uses a stock Android OS device the more advertising eyeballs that Google could own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Cherry Mobiles Fone i could serve as a template to create a little more expensive Android One version using the Atom x I believe that a more expensive version of the Fone i will give it GB of RAM More RAM should boost its performance as a stock Android OS device ASUSTeK OTCASUUY has had great success with Intelpowered Android phones since last year Intels bit virtualization of Android has helped Asus create GB RAMequipped phablets and phones that run fast even under Asuss Custom User Interface and the usual bloatware of its own preinstalled apps I hope Google will soon trust the nm bit Atom x SoC that ARMbased semiconductor firm Rockchip helped design <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Rockchip have created a dirtcheap x mobile processor that is as energyefficient as any MediaTek entrylevel ARM processor But just in case Google is still not fully convinced that an x chip from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could perfectly run on stock Android One phones there are the Spreadtrum ARMbased processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>owns of Spreadtrums parent company Tsinghua Holdings Im sure Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can persuade Spreadtrum to sell its entrylevel bit ARMbased chips for Android One phones Cherry Mobile is using Spreadtrums singlecore GHz Spreadtrum SC processor to help it create the pesos only Fire OS smartphone the Cherry Mobile Ace I believe a singlecore Spreadtrum SoC could decently run stock Android OS if Google will give it at least GB of RAM The threat of Fire OS smartphones is bigger than that of Samsungs OTCSSNLF Tizen platform Unlike Samsung which is still by itself on Tizen other companies are actually really selling Fire OS phones The Android One mission of Google is therefore also a defensive manuever against dirtcheap Firefox OS smartphones Intels x chips helped Google Chromebooks win big in the education market This is the peerless advantage of using x processors they are compatible with almost any modern operating systems Google knows all too well that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is ignoring the Atom x and Atom x for its Lumia smartphones Google could really negotiate an advantageous supply contract with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because that chipzilla is desperate to increase its market share in smartphone application processors Microsoft continues to rely on Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragons for its entrylevel sub Lumia phones I would appreciate it if Google uses Intels dirtcheap Atom processors to counter the threat of the Windows Lumia phones with Android One handsets Nadellas shift toward a freemium strategy requires Microsoft to be more like Google Microsoft wants to sell as many Windows devices as possible for data gathering advertising purposes Microsoft aims to have billion Windows devices as soon as possible Nadellas ambition further aggravates Googles future in mobile Windows s free licensing adds to the threat of the iOS platform which is now increasingly being antagonistic over Googles multibillion dollar income from advertising to iPhoneiPad users The person who could only afford a Android phone is still a precious pair of real advertising eyeballs Google needs the Android One handset to further increase the billion number of people who already have an Android device Unlike Apple I do not think Google will ever allow greedy thirdparty browser extension developers to make selling adblock tools on Android One devices I rate GOOGLGOOG as a Buy This advertising behemoths stock has outperformed its megacap peers this year The majority of investors believe Google was and still is the grandmaster when it comes to digital advertising We only use your contact details to reply to your request for
