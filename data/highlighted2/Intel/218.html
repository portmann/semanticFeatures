style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem for use in a future iPhone has encouraged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>supporters However modem sales do not represent a foot in the door for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to sell mobile SOCs to Apple Venture Beats report on March that an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC modem had been selected by Apple NASDAQ AAPL for an upcoming iPhone targeted at emerging markets had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls salivating but the celebration was short lived after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>lowered its guidance for the March quarter The modem selection if it goes through does offer a glimpse of the future for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Apple but perhaps not the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls have in mind One of the things Ive noticed in writing for SA for the past almost two years is that fans of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also tend to be fans of other large chipmakers especially Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Its understandable in retrospect since they share a common business model as commodity IC manufacturers Writing in it struck me as odd since it was apparent to me that the companies were on a collision course with business objectives that were ultimately mutually exclusive With the news that Apple had selected an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE modem rather than going with its longtime modem supplier Qualcomm we witnessed just the sort of collision I had in mind But the ramifications are greater than just the competition between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm The manufacture of systems on chip SOCs for mobile devices continues to shift from the commodity paradigm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomm Nvidia to the custom paradigm pioneered by Apple in the A SOC for the first iPad More importantly for the commodity processor makers consumer interest has continued to shift away from commodity PCs in favor of mobile devices Intels revised guidance for the March quarter was due primarily to declining PC sales which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>attributed to slower than expected business and XP refresh sales But PC sales have suffered for some time as a result of competition from mobile devices and the increasing capability of mobile devices has many consumers and businesses thinking outside of the PC box At the same time Apples success with the latest iPhone and Plus has made the custom paradigm dominant in the mobile device world This has exerted a Darwinian survival pressure on commodity IC makers in general and the industry has evolved in order to try to adapt to the new paradigm One of the features of this evolution has been considerable consolidation in the industry with the FreescaleNPX merger being only the most recent This was proudly highlighted in a chart by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CFO Stacy Smith for their annual Investor Meeting Intels naivet about what the chart truly portends is almost touching One of the very important survival strategies for the commodity IC makers is to become a preferred supplier of one of the big mobile device makers such as Apple Here commodity ICs still have a role to play by supplying functionality that hasnt been incorporated into the SOC But its a role that must get smaller with time as more and more functionality becomes integrated into the SOC Thus the decline in the number of suppliers highlighted in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chart The shrinking role for secondary commodity ICs has been masked by a number of nearterm effects not the least of which is the sheer growth in the mobile device business since the advent of the iPhone Another effect has been the incorporation of greater functionality into smartphones themselves which has often mandated accessory ICs for things such as motion sensors and communications devices such as the NFC radios incorporated into iPhone to support Apple Pay The potential loss by Qualcomm of Apples modem business brings into focus the ongoing pressure on commodity IC makers The debut of Samsungs OTCSSNLF Galaxy S which will use a Samsung custom SOC rather than a Qualcomm SOC provided the confirmation of the forward guidance provided by Qualcomm management in their fiscal Q earnings release Looking ahead we have lowered our revenue outlook for our semiconductor business for the second half of the fiscal year and lowered our EPS expectations These changes are largely driven by the effects of A shift in share among OEMs at the premium tier which has reduced our nearterm opportunity for sales of our integrated Snapdragon processors and has skewed our product mix towards more modem chipsets in this tier Apple iPhone impact Expectations that our Snapdragon processor will not be in the upcoming design cycle of a large customers flagship device Samsung Galaxy S impact Comments in bold parentheses are mine Qualcomm guided to effectively flat revenue for its fiscal based on the above listed effects As the progenitor of the custom SOC paradigm shift and the most successful Apple has pushed Qualcomm into secondtier status as an accessory IC supplier and forced the competition with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>This is not a big win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants to be the SOC supplier for the mobile devices of the world just as it has been the CPU supplier for the PCs of the world This is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>business model that so many still believe in Those who believe in the continuing viability of this business model must assume that Apple will eventually choose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for its mobile devices for the same reasons it chose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for its personal computers superiority in performance and cost This is an argument by analogy that doesnt hold up under close scrutiny The superiority in performance and cost of x over PowerPC was a direct consequence of the small scale of PowerPC production The revenue generated by PowerPC was never large enough to allow the manufacturers IBM NYSE IBM and Motorola to keep up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>either in processor design or in manufacturing Apple had entered into the PowerPC alliance in the hope of developing a superior processing architecture to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>When it became clear that the PowerPC alliance had failed in that key objective Apple had no choice but to switch to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>vs ARM the tables have been turned with the benefits of economies of scale favoring ARM architecture devices Furthermore the fabless model prevalent in the ARM world demonstrates that its not necessary for fabless semiconductor makers to own the means of production The ARM foundries can spread the benefits of production scale across multiple customers The success of the fabless model has enabled Apple to produce its own SOCs without significant cost penalty relative to commodity makers such as Qualcomm or even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Although not everyone has accepted my assertion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture is significantly costdisadvantaged relative to ARM Ive not seen anyone assert that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can offer a cost advantage without some form of marketing subsidy So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cannot offer a cost advantage to Apple can it at least offer a performance advantage I wouldnt completely rule this out since it depends on the resourcefulness and creativity of the systems designers at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which I wouldnt want to minimize However I think this is a low probability shot for a number of reasons Intels performance advantage as a result of manufacturing is likely to be short lived Certainly Apples Ax has been demonstrated to be superior to Bay Trail fabricated on Intels nm process Even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>began fabricating Cherry Trail now Atom X X on its more advanced nm process Samsung was in production on its own Exynos SOCs and probably Apples next generation Aseries on nm FinFET as well On the processor design front Apple has demonstrated that it has a very talented design staff along with the advantage of using a more modern and efficient CPU architecture in ARM I doubt that there is any design advantage that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can achieve that Apple will not match with its own innovations Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could show some marginal performance advantage for Atom X compared to Apples next Aseries Apple would still be reluctant to make a switch The final advantage that Apple derives from its custom SOCs is that theyre custom Customization allows Apple to tailor the SOC to the needs of the device The better integration and efficiency afforded by SOC customization is part of what makes Apple mobile devices work so well This is perhaps the most important consideration Apples custom SOCs give it an important discriminator in the highly competitive mobile device market Regardless of whom Apple chooses for its modem supplier the winner will not be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or Qualcomm but Apple Apple will get the best possible product at the lowest possible price with suppliers falling all over themselves to get and keep
