Reasons Why Cash Is Much More Important Than Jim Kellers Departure Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha Keller leaves but thats his modus operandi CFO Kumar says the company needs a minimum of M in cash to operate effectively Just recently AMD NASDAQ AMD announced the departure of its lead chip designer the industryfamous Jim Keller for the ubiquitous to pursue other opportunities Well at least it wasnt to spend more time with his family That one is a sure sign he got canned In this article I explain why Keller leaving AMD is less important to its future than the cash position the company has at the end of this quarter In the nottoodistant past the bottom number was M but last quarter AMD CFO changed that to M I think AMD may be dangerously close to that number now I leave and the leaving is so exhilarating I know I can never go back But then what We have all known extremely bright people who get bored easily I have a sneaking suspicion Keller is one of those people He gets excited does some groundbreaking work DEC Alpha Athlon x bit etc then gets bored and looks around for something exciting again Since when he was with DEC remember it working on its most advanced Alpha processor until today Keller has had different employments including AMD twice SiByte Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM PA Semiconductor Apple NASDAQ AAPL and then AMD again Thats jobs in years or less than years per job Hes been at AMD for his second go round just over years or about average for him As a comparison how many jobs have you had in the last years The design function is certainly complete for Zen and thats the part that keeps a guy like Keller interested At this point it is in the hands of the manufacturing engineers at AMD and Global Foundries Whatever minor changes that are involved going forward will not require a talent like Kellers to implement The key to AMDs success is to get the Zen out the door and there is little or nothing Keller can do about that anyway My guess is K work the other design that probably interested Keller originally has been put on the back burner until at least and that left Keller with nothing that really interested him so adios The size of the pie is shrinking so cash may shrink too At the end of AMD CFO Devinder Kumar said that the goal was to have between M and B in cash at all times At the end of last quarter he downgraded the low end a bit to M Now supposedly that was because of cuts made in headcount and RD but still for a company AMDs size that is a significant chunk of cash Quarterly sales in the last year have dropped M B to M and cost of goods sold by M M to M so certainly less cash should be needed to run the daytoday operations But inventories jumped M last quarter to M and are now very close to quarterly sales of M which is not a good sign Although cash was OK at the end of last quarter AMD has had negative free cash flow four out of the last quarters for a total of negative M AMD needs to get Zen out the door in or it needs an infusion of cash between now and In my opinion Zen is the most important development for AMD since the Athlon If the company is successful then sales in the x world both desktop and servers will soar as AMD more evenly competes with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Remember because AMD is so small compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>capturing just an additional small percentage of Intels B in PC and server sales would about double AMDs current Computing and Enterprise server sales my est Mqtr not counting console chip sales If AMD gets of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales profits will certainly surge to levels not seen in years and correspondingly the price of its stock AMD continues to struggle as it tries to bring more competitive products to market Sales continue to decrease and AMD management continues to cut expenses The key product for real sales and profit growth is the Zen product designed and brought to its current point by great chip designer Jim Keller But the design phase is over and now management needs to get Zen into production quickly and efficiently Rumors continue of a buyout and with its x production rights and Zen possibilities in desktop and servers I would think there would be more than a little interest from outside parties Supporting that contention is CEO Lisa Sus approach to outside investors looking for an investment to carry it over to the launch of Zen and maybe K a year or two down the road Earlier this year we reported that Lisa Su had met with investment firms to discuss possible options for AMD including restructuring or spinning off parts of the company The recent GPU restructuring might or might not be part of a deal ExtremeTech Absent an investment equity or convertible preferred or a buyout AMD may be in a race with the cliff somewhere in the distance but not all that far away But with its IP and the high sales potential of products in the pipeline I dont think AMD will go out of business The companys assets are unique in an industry constantly looking for uniqueness If it can launch Zen in and maintain or increase its position in graphics then the stock price has huge upside potential as I have previously written in AMD This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
