style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will release first quarter earnings Tuesday after the closing bell Analysts are modeling softer EPS on a flat revenue compared to previous quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC will release first quarter earnings on Tuesday April after market close On average the analyst community estimates Intels EPS will be with revenue at billion I expect the company to beat analysts estimates In this article I share the basis of my expectation In the first quarter of Intels EPS came in at on flat YoY revenue of billion Weak client computing group revenue driven by declining PC sales was responsible for flat YoY revenue However client computing group revenue was offset by meaningful YoY growth in datacenter IoT and nonvolatile memory revenue I expect Intels client computing group revenue in the first quarter will arrive at billion give or take million or so compared to billion a year ago Although Gartner and IDC reported that PC shipments were down globally in the first quarter of I expect that Intels client computing group will remain relatively immune to this declining trend Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now reports PC and mobile chip sales under the client computing group and growing mobile chip sales driven by Atom processors should partially offset declining PC chip sales As a result client computing group revenue may witness an early sign of stabilization <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>spent billions in the past two years to expand its mobile footprint via introducing new Atom processors intended for tablets and smartphones The processors remained wellreceived across the industry with OEMs like HP NYSE HPQ Lenovo and Dell embedding them in their mobile devices In addition to tablets and smartphones the lowcost Windows laptops called cloudbooks powered by Intels Pentium and Celeron processors are also helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sell lowpower PC chips And the sales volume may no be insignificant I am encouraged by Intels plan to release a new generation of Pentium and Celeron processors in the second half this year These lowpower chips codenamed Apollo Bay will be used not only in cloudbooks but in tablets as well I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will introduce these Goldmont architecturebased Apollo Bay chips because such chips are seeing impressive adoption by OEMs Apollo Bay will succeed Airmont architecturebased Braswell In October last year during the thirdquarter conference call Intels chief financial officer Stacy Smith said We now expect the data center business to grow in the lowdoubledigits versus the prior forecast of approximately percent Relative to our forecast at the beginning of the year we are seeing a weaker enterprise segment being partially offset by a strongerthanexpected cloud segment In the fourth quarter of Intels datacenter group revenue was billion up YoY Intels recent launch of the BroadwellEP server platform will boost its datacenter group revenue from the second quarter New cloud datacenter buildouts across the globe will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sell the new server chips namely the Xeon E v processor family in the coming quarters In the first quarter though I expect that Intels existing server chips were enjoying the momentum that was built in The general expectation is that Intels datacenter revenue growth will slow down to around in the first quarter due to weaker macro conditions worldwide particularly China I believe datacenter revenue will see a strong YoY recovery due to favorable comps In absolute terms it should be over billion primarily driven by continued hyperscale cloud deployments In addition continued onpremise deployments driven by ongoing enterprise refresh cycle although the cycle is approaching the end should also have a positive impact on Intels datacenter revenue Other Groups Should Get a Boost Driven by Altera Revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said it will change its financial reporting structure from the first quarter earnings release It will report Alteras earnings in its new programmable solutions group Revenue from its security software business will now be reported in a group called the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>security group and the software and services segment will be dropped Further the company will report revenue from its flash memory business in the nonvolatile memory solutions group Revenue from Altera should be around million driven by continued momentum around the telecom and wireless industry I expect that Intels security software revenue will be impressive as a result of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Securitys new strategy which I discussed in a previous article However I dont expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>security groups revenue will cross million just yet given the business is evolving Finally the IoT group revenue should grow meaningfully YoY driven by Intels introduction of a wide range of processors including Quark Atom Core and Xeon I expect the IoT group and the nonvolatile memory solutions group together should register between million and billion in revenue Per my estimates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should clock more than billion in total revenue in first quarter Applying a net margin of average of last four quarters on billion revenue I get an EPS of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>really beats analysts estimates the shares should rally However what happens next entirely depends on the general market condition I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
