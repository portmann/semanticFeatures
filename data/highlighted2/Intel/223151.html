match for Intels SkylakeGen SoCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphics Gen is better than Carrizo iGPU INTC is working very hard on integrated graphics Intels eDRAM introduction at W makes its midend and highend solutions more compelling than before Zen architecture will be a certain remarkable improvement but INTC has a lot of firepower for the following years With the last Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD Carrizo APU release people thought that AMD could achieve very good results in the APU field reducing the performance gap against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQ INTC while achieving some graphics advantage AMD claimed an improvement about of IPC and of performance per watt at W TDP As for the graphics field AMD claimed performance than the last Kaveri APUs at the same TDP Such a boost would have set a good base start for the successive Zen architecture which will effectively reach the market in I must admit that I was quite skeptical about those performance claims and first benchmarks confirm my doubts In addition it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has worked very hard on integrated GPUs and it is finally introducing the eDRAM even in those W SoCs providing a huge graphics boost that AMD cannot reach even with its last architecture From the CPU point of view it would have been possible to see more improvement from Steamroller to Excavator than from Broadwell to Skylake However the last benchmarks tell a different story AMD AP performs roughly better than AMD AB while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>i UU performs roughly better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>i UU This simply means that Excavator architecture meets the claims but it only provides a performance improvement talking about similar to Skylake Obviously since Intels solution is quite faster Skylake provides a better absolute improvement First Surface Book reviews show that Skylake could perform even better when the thermal dissipation is built correctly Microsoft Corporations NASDAQ MSFT devices are to be well considered when talking about benchmark comparisons However this is not where I want to focus since its always clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake would have been widely faster I want to focus on the GPU field instead where AMD basically claims to be faster and more competitive We can check the following table where I resumed performance improvements on similarspecular benchmarks for HD HD R Kaveri and R Carrizo note that there are still few benchmarks available to make a comparison The performance leap from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphics Gen to Gen is greater compared to the performance leap from Kaveri to Carrizo This makes sense since AMD had to lower the TDP by W while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is pushing very hard on graphics improvements Unfortunately there is only one game benchmark available at the moment it is Dota This is a game that significantly favors Intels graphics at low resolution and quality settings a scenario where the CPU must work hard to elaborate the high GPU frame rate On the contrary at higher resolution and quality settings Intels GPU generally loses some of its advantage because the CPU is not the bottleneck anymore Therefore it is interesting to see that the HD improves much more than R Carrizo in a scenario which has always been in AMDs favor I must point out that the HD as well as HD powers a wide range of SoCs from i to i solutions the graphics performance difference is very narrow between these kinds of SoCs and it is not unusual to see an i to perform better than an i due to thermal constraints Remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>W TDP SoCs are usually employed in Ultrabooks and in Surface Pro is an example while the first AMD Carrizo benchmarks come from a bulky laptop which generally favors thermal dissipation Just from this comparison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has done a good job in the graphics field and this causes my skepticism If AMD targets the graphics field with its APUs why would customers prefer its solutions all of a sudden Excavator did not erode any relevant performance gap compared to Skylake while Carrizo iGPU provides a quite lower improvement than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Graphics Gen AMD exploited an old lowcost miniaturization technology nm it has set very low price targets and it has endured continuous losses trying to achieve any relevant market share but Intels dominion is still intact The same scenario is repeating itself with ExcavatorCarrizo or maybe it is even worse Obviously we have to wait some time to analyze the future reviews of both the products but first reviews put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>even better positioned than last year a XPS with i U is roughly faster than a XPS with i U in Metro at low settings a very high demanding game The first R Carrizo benchmarks show that this APU deeply suffers thermal throttling if the dissipation system is not good enough Looking at what I have been able to find out note that the linked article shows internal tests but in real recent benchmarks R Carrizo performs lower in D Mark R Carrizo should perform better than R Carrizo by Such a boost is obviously welcomed but it would be only sufficient to reach HD average performance in GFXBench and DMark Things get worse if we consider games with BroadwellGen since there is only one comparable result for Skylake at the moment If we take all the Notebookcheck benchmark games at playable settings for HD and R Carrizo we will notice that Broadwell is roughly faster than R This means that Broadwell will have similar performances compared to R implying that Skylake HD will be significantly faster without any eDRAM module <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>employed the eDRAM module in various SoCs starting from W solutions but this year it has been introduced starting from the W offer The topend Surface Pro employs an i U which is powered by a HD Iris GPU with EUs and MB of eDRAM Looking at first recent benchmarks this GPU is able to outperform the HD by with the same TDP while it is roughly on par with the HD Iris Pro W SoC To better evaluate its graphics capacity it will be able to outperform GPUs like M and it will be able to face something like a MX Macbook Pro Retina or slightly better Given this scenario the eDRAM makes possible to decently play games and drive professional D programs if the D project is not excessively heavy Even from the price point of view there is only a small difference since the i U costs just more than i U or i U while the i U and i U cost just more than i U and i U This means one thing What you have seen in the previous chart was simply meaningless because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has clearly raised the bar with the eDRAM addition which enables it to massively outperform AMD in the W midend and highend solutions This kind of performance difference was quite unthinkable just last year What about the Zen architecture The server Zen SoCs will be released in Q with market product presence in H while the desktop and laptop solutions will be released in mid These SoCs will provide a better IPC by but we know that such high claims hardly meet reality and they will be built with a nm node technology achieving a high core count however the sources state that Zen will adopt cores for W and cores for W Will this be enough to reach <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Sincerely I do not think so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will release two new architectures in Kaby Lake and in Cannonlake in addition it will release two new GPU architectures at the same time INTC is also planning to release Cannonlake at nm and to double the core count projecting to also increase eDRAM adoption If we want to consider HBMs such a technology is not suitable for integrated GPUs because these SoCs do not have feeding requirements even comparable to discrete highperformance GPUs Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could still adopt D XPoint and MCDRAM to face an eventual AMD HBM SoC adoption Given these points it is very difficult to see competitive results from AMDs Zen architecture It will certainly be a nice improvement but from what AMD has already disclosed its chances to provide a really competitive solution are still very low SteamrollerCarrizo APUs cannot change AMDs fate even in this generation The relative CPU improvement is similar to what Skylake is showing at the same TDP while the GPU comparison looks worse than expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphics Gen has improved graphics performance at a major rate compared to AMD tipping the balance towards its favor AMD has obviously achieved good results reducing the TDP by and improving performances but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphics simply grew much more If we also consider Intels eDRAM solutions INTC clearly owns the medium and highperformance segments without any doubts In my opinion AMD has no chance of achieving relevant market share and it will continue to register losses in the laptop and desktop segment through There is still little hope for the Zen architecture since the last cash infusion will permit AMD to release it in but if we consider AMDs claims and Intels potential for the following years it is frankly really hard to see the Sunnyvale company living better times in future Even the chance to see Apples NASDAQ AAPL devices running AMDs SoCs custom or Zen looks quite unlikely to happen In any case I do not exclude that Apple is evaluating this route but at the same time AAPL is evaluating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to build future modems and application processors to power its iPhones and iPads Moreover if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>maintains its performance per watt leadership Apple is unlikely to turn down the faster solution no matter the price The entry level Mac line would be the only segment where a slower AMD APU would make sense but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would still provide a probably more suitable solution given the upcoming nm Cannonlake The actual scenario makes me consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a quite solid and consistent longterm buy with a very good potential in many fields For what concerns AMD with the recent cash infusion it could be an object of some speculation but it is a stock I would not consider to invest in now Its destiny is too much uncertain and it is all based upon Zens success and the eventual major contracts with Apple AMD is more likely to be acquired or go
