class='textDiv'>Facebook Great Company But A Tricky Valuation Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Sharebased compensation can lead to bad capital allocation decisions The impacts of sharebased compensation can be difficult to measure Facebook NASDAQ FB is a great company but understanding its valuation can be difficult The company has a relatively high level of sharebased compensation and this creates uncertainty It is wonderful the way the company is growing revenue but its hard to know how much current owners will benefit from this growth as costs like sharebased compensation continue to rise I view share based compensation as a real expense and it confuses me when companies like Facebook and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL use nonGAAP numbers that exclude it Leon Cooperman said that he once asked Andy Grove what statement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC was making when buying back stock at times earnings Here is his recollection of Andy Groves answer Were not looking to make any statement we just dont want the crap from the shareholders over dilution so were buying back sufficient shares to keep the share count flat NYSSA A Case Study in Financial Brilliance Dr Henry E Singleton of Teledyne Inc to A hidden cost of sharebased compensation is that it can lead to bad capital allocation decisions One way to think about the cost of sharebased compensation is to look at what a company has to spend buying back shares in order to keep dilution flat It can cause companies to buy back stock based on dilution concerns without regard as to whether the shares are undervalued or overvalued This is capital that could otherwise be allocated to things like dividends and acquisitions Facebook is not yet buying back shares to control dilution but the company will have to face the dilution impact sooner or later Looking at some numbers helps to put things in perspective Again Facebook is outside of my circle of competence because the impact of their high stock based compensation is hard to quantify By contrast I own Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Im comfortable with their relatively small stock based compensation numbers Googles stockbased compensation is higher than I would like to see but I own them as well Facebook has a high percentage of sharebased compensation to revenue and for first half and respectively Looking at the percentage against revenue alone can be like comparing apples to oranges since some companies have better margins than others As such its good to look at things like net income as well Facebook Google and Apple all have excellent margins so comparisons against revenue have merit Google has a lower percentage of sharebased compensation to revenue and for first half and respectively Diluted Shares million from K Morningstar shows Apple has an even lower percentage of share based compensation to revenue and for nine months and respectively We see that Apples share count is going down The company doesnt have much dilution from stockbased compensation and it has been buying back shares aggressively since The latest Qs for Facebook Google and Apple show unrecognized sharebased compensation amounts of billion billion and billion respectively Note that the fiscal year for Facebook and Google ends on December st but it ends on September th for Apple The share based compensation expense has been included in the GAAP net income numbers above but Facebook and Google also use nonGAAP numbers that leave it out Apple is the only one of the three that sticks to GAAP earnings The Barrons How Much Do Silicon Valley Firms Really Earn article by Andrew Bary gives me concerns about Google Google is a prime example with a projected stockcomp expense of billion this year or an average of about for each of Googles employees Googles stock comp has doubled since Google anticipates an increase to billion in Again their stock based compensation is higher than I would like but its still significantly lower than Facebooks John Bogle has pointed out that high stock based compensation can encourage manipulation It stock based compensation encourages chief executives and their chief financial officers too often with the tacit approval of their public accountants and their directors to manipulate the expectations market to their own benefit Dont Count on It by John Bogle page The dilution issue is plenty to worry about Its beyond the scope of this article to analyze the threat of manipulation Still Bogle is a highly respected authority and his words carry weight We dont need to understand all the nuances behind sharebased compensation in order to realize that it creates dilution problems It isnt that Apple and Google are comparable to Facebook It isnt that they are better investments either Its more a matter of stepping back and reflecting on why Im comfortable owning some technology companies like Apple and Google but not other companies with higher levels of sharebased compensation like Facebook Its possible that Facebook will be a great investment over the next or years However I dont have to swing at every pitch Disclosure I amwe are
