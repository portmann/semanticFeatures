Alpha Rising dividend yield means net cash flow savings While shares of chip giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC initially rose after the companys Q earnings report the rally didnt last long Shares have declined more than two dollars from their postearnings highs losing the level a few times last week With shares pulling back along with US interest rates remaining low it seems like management may want to consider issuing more debt to fund a larger buyback program Back in July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had a billion debt offering to help fund its purchase of Altera There were four parts to this issuance ranging from to years In the image below you can see the size of each debt issue its maturity and corresponding interest rate The weighted average cost of this debt came to and this was before subtracting out related tax savings If we were to assume a tax rate around where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been mostly in recent years youre down to about in annual interest expenses I bring this up mainly because with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares closing barely above on Friday the annual dividend yield was This assumes the current rate continues and the yield could be even higher if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>raises its dividend early in Thus if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was using the above debt to buy back shares the company would actually realize a cash flow savings overall because it saves more on dividend payments than the cost of the debts interest To think about what interest rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would get on a similar debt deal today there are three items to think about The first is the companys overall situation which I dont think has really changed since July The PC business is weak the Data Center Group is growing and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to make strides in mobile Intels longterm prospects are tied into how it can continue to evolve in this ever changing technological landscape For the time being <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to produce annual revenues in the mid to high billion area with net income in the billion to billion area There are two major financial items to think about and the first is Intels balance sheet At the end of Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had a little more than million in net cash cash and shortterm investments minus debt At the end of Q the company had swung to billion plus in net debt which makes sense given the large Altera purchase Given Intels cash flow situation the company will head back toward a net zero position in the next year or two if it maintains its current dividend and limited buyback policy A slightly weaker balance sheet however might cause some investors to demand more of a risk premium meaning a higher interest rate On the flip side US interest rates have come down tremendously since that debt deal in late July In the chart below you can see how the Year US Treasury yield has dipped by about basis points since then and is currently at the lower end of its yearly range Weve also seen the Year rate come down by about basis points or so This could lower Intels overall rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had a weighted average interest rate of back in July but it seems likely that the number could come down into the to range now if we saw a similar debt issuance Given the tax savings of debt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might be close to an aftertax cost of around while the stocks annual dividend yield is almost basis points higher than that or more than bps if you factor in a potential dividend raise Given the recent dip in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares as well as US interest rates it seems like management should consider issuing debt for a more powerful buyback program The company is in decent financial shape and cash flow savings can probably be achieved between the reduced dividend payments vs the cost of debt Such a program also would help the companys earnings per share add another bidder to the market for shares and maybe provide a signal from management that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is undervalued Perhaps the company will decide it doesnt want to go too far into a net debt position but given the current market environment I think management should at least consider the debtforbuyback idea Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next
