style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expects its annual data center group revenue growth will remain soft due to weaker than expected macro environment I expect the companys data center group revenue will grow at a CAGR in the high teens in the next five years This will act as a huge boost for the companys stock price which could rise as much as from the current level In the justreported third quarter Intels NASDAQ INTC data center revenue grew yearoveryear compared to in the same quarter last year However the company now expects annual growth rate for data center and Internet of Things businesses will remain soft due to weaker macroeconomic environment Intels chief financial officer Stacy Smith said Both the data center and Internet of Things businesses will also exhibit strong growth But the annual growth rate for these businesses will be lower than expectations at the beginning of the year as a result of weakerthanexpected macroeconomic growth We now expect the data center business to grow in the lowdoubledigits versus the prior forecast of approximately percent Anyways I believe this is temporary and in the long run ie the next five years Intels data center revenue will grow at a much faster pace I expect Intels share price to remain rangebound in the near term and going into it will break out on the upside I started buying Intels shares post the third quarter earnings after exiting positions almost a year ago I am planning to accumulate more shares during the rest of this year Intels primary growth driver data center and cloud Smith noted that although the enterprise segment remained weak during the third quarter the cloud segment was stronger than expected Both data center and cloud businesses will fuel Intels next round of growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expects that cloud adoption has tremendous room to grow from where it stands today more about this later The data center group DCG currently contributes less than to the chipmakers overall revenue which could rise substantially in the next two years Reuters recently reported The data center group comprised about percent of the companys total revenue in the third quarter ended Sept Analysts expect the business to account for about percent of the total by In the following section I will focus on how the company is preparing to grow its DCG revenue A new report suggests that rising demand for data storage space coupled with the green data center initiative undertaken by several governments will ignite the global data center market to grow at a CAGR of from billion in to billion in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is undoubtedly in the best position to benefit from this emerging trend compared to other server chipmakers In server terms green data centers need chips with improved performance per watt ratios so that a given operating temperature could be maintained with less cooling efforts Intels introduction of Broadwellbased Xeon D SoC earlier this year is a tremendous achievement in this direction AnandTechs Johan De Gelas one of the most respected CPU experts wrote about the Xeon D If you only look at the integer performance of a single Broadwell core the improvement over the Haswell based core is close to boring But the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to combine of them together with dual Gbit USB controllers SATA controller and quite a bit more inside a SoC that needs less than W makes it an amazing product In fact we have not seen such massive improvements from one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generation to another since the launch of the Xeon The performance per watt of a Xeon D is better than the Haswell based E Xeon EL Gelas expects that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will further improve the Xeon D line Intels recent acquisition of Altera will help the chipmaker improve not only the Xeon D line but its entire range of data center chips Altera is a server FPGA field programmable gate arrays maker which is primarily used in networking and storage systems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will incorporate Alteras technology into its server chips As a result the chips will become much more technologically advanced leaving competitors chips far behind Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is creating an unbeatable product line for tomorrows data centers and at the same time it is also creating a wide moat around its server chip business I believe even if the macro environment doesnt improve significantly going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would still be able to grow its data center revenue at a significant pace In the worst case scenario I expect the companys DCG compounded annual growth rate will hover around the current level of low doubledigits My base case is a CAGR in the high teens in the next five years What would support the base case scenario In order to grow revenue in high teens on a sustainable basis developing products with advanced features as mentioned above isnt enough Aside from developing an advanced product line creating a market for the products is also very important Intels initiative of building a cloud infrastructure that would be able to take advantage of its future chips is very impressive which I expect will support the base case scenario I mentioned above that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expects that cloud adoption has tremendous room for growth from todays levels Diane Bryant senior VP and general manager of Intels Data Center Group said that today half of the worlds applications run on cloud infrastructure and of them will run in the cloud by As a part of the companys cloud infrastructure building initiative <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has joined hands with Rackspace Hosting NYSE RAX for creating an OpenStack Innovation Center at the Rackspace headquarters in San Antonio where they will offer developers the opportunity to test and validate OpenStack code There will be a continued stream of investments that we will be making Bryant said Intels DCG revenue was billion in the third quarter For fullyear the companys DCG revenue should be around billion A CAGR growth of will drive Intels DCG revenue to billion in If this represents of the companys total revenue as per analysts expectations the companys total revenue for should be around billion or per share With huge room for DCG revenue expansion in the subsequent years Ill be comfortable with a price to sales multiple of x for Intels stock which will result in per share in the next two years a
