class='textDiv'>Risks To The Micron Long Thesis Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital has reduced his funds position in Micron over the last quarter While the companys shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely over the long term there are many risks that could derail the Micron long thesis Microns D NAND and XPoint have the potential to significantly impact the profitability of the company over the long term It is far from impossible that unexpected engineering challenges will emerge The NVM oligopoly is not as strong as the DRAM oligopoly Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are likely to force the competition to spend and innovate to catch up For those that have read my prior articles on Seeking Alpha it is pretty obvious that I am very bullish on the prospects of Micron NASDAQ MU The company finds itself in the midst of a great transformation in the memory industry While we are still years away the beginning of the era of a gigantic shift from HDDs to SSDs is within view In NAND Micron finds itself partnered with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC the one constant near the top of the list of major semiconductor companies over the decades Micron has the potential to become the lowestcost producer of D NAND in and is also set to release the most important advancement in the memory industry D XPoint in a quarter of a century sometime next year as well In DRAM Micron via Inotera is quickly closing its cost disadvantage through a node shrink to nm While the short term is going to be bumpy the long term growth of the industry is virtually assured This is all wonderful for Micron investors and I have mentioned these points many times throughout most of my articles on Seeking Alpha I now want to point out the risks to the long thesis that I firmly believe in David Einhorns Greenlight Capital is one of the largest hedge fund shareholders of Micron Einhorn is with good reason one of the most respected hedge fund managers around In his third quarter letter to investors he writes about Micron and says The problem is that structural industry improvement doesnt make DRAM less cyclical The large capital requirements force participants to make large investments in anticipation of future demand If the industry overestimates demand it still makes sense to operate at full capacity and oversupply ensues This year demand came up short DRAM prices collapsed and despite our concerns about PC demand we missed the turn of the cycle Regarding Microns NAND business he writes Micron Technologys other business is flash memory or NAND We anticipated a significant recovery in NAND this year that failed to materialize He also identifies two other risks a possible Chinese expansion into DRAM and Microns more aggressive capital expenditures plan As a result of these risks Einhorn has reduced Greenlights stake in Micron The highly cyclical nature of the memory industry is unlikely to change in this decade the next decade or ever The unfortunate nature of the industry is that demand can move up and down tremendously over a very short period of time while supply is close to flat when looking at most small windows of time It takes billions and now more like tens of billions to build a fab and a few years before a fab can begin rolling out wafers of memory products Going forward the members of the memory oligopoly and Micron with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in particular should see higher highs and less frightening lows in the cycle I believe we are seeing that already with the current cycle The first potentially catastrophic risk that Einhorn mentions in his letter involves the desire of China to manufacture DRAM With just three major manufacturers in Samsung OTCSSNLF SK Hynix OTCHXSCF and Micron the oligopoly seems to be strong and getting stronger with Micron potentially eyeing an acquisition of Nanya Inotera andor Winbond Last year it was reported that China is looking to invest up to trillion renminbi billion to develop the semiconductor industry within its borders Rumors heated up earlier this year that Tsinghua Unigroup was looking to acquire Micron for billion In one of my prior articles Micron and Chinas Semiconductor Dreams I discussed how difficult it would be for a Chinese company or any company for that matter without the aid of Micron SK Hynix or Samsung to break into the DRAM industry At a Raymond James conference in September Microns Kipp Bedard estimated it would likely cost a Chinese firm billion and years to develop a viable DRAM manufacturing business if it were to develop the business completely organically That would seem to be a very large deterrent but it appears Tsinghua is making moves that make me wonder if that large financial and technological moat is enough to prevent a new entrant into the industry Tsinghua Unigroup has hired Charles Kau the president of Nanya Technology and the chairman of Inotera Memories Micron is the largest shareholder of Inotera and buys all of its DRAM output Kau is leaving his position at Nanya and it is unclear whether he will retain his role at Inotera While it seems that Tsinghua Unigroup is positioning itself for an attempt to acquire Micron or at least form a joint venture with the Idahobased company in China there remains the possibility that Tsinghua is unable to strike a deal with Micron and decides to attempt to go it alone in building a successful DRAM fab There is no other company in the world without the backing of a government with deep pockets that could realistically even attempt this Herculean challenge A new entrant into the industry who may not be as focused on the bottom line as its Korean and American counterparts could put the industry back into a dark age reminiscent of Ultimately I believe China will either give up its DRAM dreams or find a way to partner with Micron or another DRAM manufacturer Tsinghua Unigroup recently purchased a stake in Powertech a major Taiwanese chip packaging and testing company Powertech and Micron have a joint venture in China to package the bulk of Microns memory chips going forward Tsinghua and its affiliates has now struck deals with some of Microns key partners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Powertech and has also poached an executive at a Micron affiliate Inotera There is risk of a potential catastrophe in the making but I see very low odds of Tsinghua making a huge investment in building an independent DRAM fab that has what I view as a very high probability of failure While I feel like I am not worthy of questioning a king Einhorn I believe the odds of a Chinese DRAM manufacturer emerging out of nowhere is low enough to not meaningfully impact an investment thesis Micron has increased its guidance on capital expenditure for FY In a perfect oligopoly this should not occur often One would expect all members of the oligopoly to keep capital expenditures low and supply tight especially given how high the barriers to entry are into NAND and DRAM However in NVM nonvolatile memory the thesis of a strong memory oligopoly being in place is starting to break down We are headed down a path where four NAND manufacturers are going to use four different D NAND architectures A nextgeneration NVM D XPoint has been developed by Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which appears to have the potential to create enormous change in the memory hierarchy of electronic devices We are likely going to see four or more nextgeneration NVM architectures emerge as a response to Micron and Intels D XPoint The NVM portion of the memory industry appears to be competitive going forward The NVM universe needs to be viewed from a vantage point that includes not only Samsung SK Hynix SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK with Toshiba and Micron with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but also Western Digital NASDAQ WDC Seagate NASDAQ STX and potentially others While I view Micron with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as the company in the lead by a wide margin with its D NAND and D XPoint it certainly is not a foregone conclusion that the very talented and accomplished engineering teams of Samsung and SanDisk and others will not be able to create comparable or perhaps even better products in the near future The first risk to Microns goals in NAND is whether its D NAND solution really is as costdisruptive as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron believe it is On paper it appears the Gb layer TLC NAND die on mm will be the densest D NAND product in the market in There are no guarantees that Micron will be able to get this product out in high volume next year The company expects half of its NAND bits to come from D NAND by the end of but unexpected technological problems could emerge It is now approaching months since Samsung has released VNAND Samsungs version of D NAND and the Korean semiconductor giant is still having significant challenges with the leakiness of its product and low yields Could Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>potentially face engineering challenges in D NAND that lead to multiquarter or even multiyear delays or unexpected additional costs It is something that seems to never get discussed but it is not outside of the realm of possibility The shift from planar NAND to D NAND is dramatic as the difficult problems of manufacturing shift away from the traditional lithography challenges of node shrinks to the new challenges of more complex etching and deposition steps Another potential pitfall of Microns strategy in NAND is its choice of using a floating gate D NAND design along with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>There are numerous advantages of a charge trap flash design over a floating gate design The incumbent leaders of NAND design SanDisk and Samsung have certainly not lost their minds by choosing D NAND architectures with this feature The answer to the question Which firms created the best D NAND designs and which ones are headed towards catastrophe will probably not be known for years It is a longterm and significant risk that should not be ignored Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have seemed to jump to a huge lead in nextgeneration NVM by revealing D XPoint this summer The planning for the initial presentation by Intels Rob Crooke and Microns Mark Durcan seemed extremely rushed Unsurprisingly the presentation did not wow the general public in a similar manner to the way Steve Jobs impressed Apple NASDAQ AAPL fanboys with new iPhones and iPads The performance characteristics of XPoint are fantastic However the cost of manufacturing this new memory and its ability to scale quickly and cost efficiently are topics management of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron do not seem to want to discuss with the investment community right now Because of the poorly planned presentation I initially believed that this technology was far from ready and might be something that starts to hit the market in or or possibly even later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced XPointbased SSDs and other XPoint products will be available in While I certainly expect this new memory to fundamentally change the memory hierarchy of electronics and make huge waves in the technology world there are reasons to believe my expectations of Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>being years ahead of the competition could end up being way off base SanDisk and HP NYSE HPQ are working on a nextgeneration NVM with similar performance characteristics that HP representatives have stated should hit the market perhaps years after XPoint However developing new memory technologies is extremely challenging Theres a very good reason why no new groundbreaking memory technology has emerged in a quarter century before XPoint and that is assuming XPoint is in fact as wonderful as I think Theres a possibility that HP and SanDisk could catch up quicker than I expect and theres certainly a possibility that they fall so far behind that their joint development effort has to get scrapped altogether Samsung and SK Hynix have been mum about developments they are making in response to D XPoint Could the Korean semiconductor companies be far behind Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>right now and not wanting to alert the industry Could the Korean giants surprise the world much like Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did by revealing their awesome new memory PCM ReRAM MRAM transistorless memory or some new fancy memory within the next year Are they working on secretive projects to develop an NVM that is quicker than DRAM has nearly infinite endurance and somehow is also cheaper than DRAM and XPoint Just as quickly as Micron longs declared victory upon the announcement of XPoint Samsung or Hynix or SanDisk could resteal the show again with no advanced notice DRAM spot prices have begun falling steadily over the last few weeks The rate of decline in spot prices is not as dramatic as it was in June and July but the declines are enough to worry Micron longs about the possibility of further compression in DRAM gross margins In my view DRAM gross margins will not serve as a major risk to Micron longs in the long term as the industry should eventually start to shift DRAM capacity elsewhere if the trajectory of DRAM prices stays as is D NAND XPoint and logic chips for the IoT should present opportunities to reduce DRAM wafer capacity in the nottoodistant future for Samsung Micron and SK Hynix Despite all of these risks and many others that I did not mention above including a slowdown in Chinas economy a slowdown in the worldwide economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>possibly competing hard against Micron in NANDXPoint and acting less like a partner of Micron prices of HDDs falling faster than that of SSDs per GB over an extended period of time etc I firmly believe Micron is very undervalued at these price levels I have been increasing my long position by buying more MU shares over the last several weeks While there are real risks that could damage Microns value in the future the riskreward ratio is very favorable for longs right now While I believe Einhorn is a fantastic fund manager I think he is making a mistake by reducing his holdings in Micron now I find myself on the opposite side of Einhorns recent MU trades It is going to be a very bumpy and hopefully profitable ride with the stock over the next months Over this time we will likely get a clear picture of the potential or perhaps failures of D NAND and XPoint I remain very optimistic about Microns prospects We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
