Nulcun Confirms Intels Foundry Superiority <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and TSMC are testing LG Nuclun architecture with their respective foundries Intels product looks to be consistently better Firstgeneration LG Nuclun was a dead project from the beginning Nuclun is completely different <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has better foundries and it looks like its capable of collaborating with customers even at a foundry level The company has great foundry potential It must push hard on the next x mobile architecture to exploit it at maximum There is a recent rumor about the LG OTCLGEAF Nuclun application processor it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and TSMC NYSE TSM are working on it with their respective node technologies Its already known that LG wants to adopt an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem XMM onto the Nuclun and there was also the opinion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a possible candidate to build the entire SoC Given the latest rumor which is likely to be true <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will probably win this match opening the route as a good foundry partner at least The firstgen Nuclun was built with ARM ARMH Cortex A cores which were already two years old at that time when Cortex A and Cortex A were already hitting the market The performance and performance per watt difference was great between those two ARM Cortex generations Additionally the Cortex A is still ARMv architecture while AA are powered by the bit ARMv architecture which are faster more futureproof and enhanced in the encryption field On top of that the firstgen Nuclun was built with a nm technology node while Samsung OTCSSNLF and Qualcomm QCOM were quite ahead Samsung already had the Exynos built with a nm HKMG node composed of A and A cores In addition it was already going to release the Exynos at nm HKMG and nm LPE Qualcomm was releasing the Snapdragon and built with a nm HPm and composed of A and A cores MediaTek OTCMDTKF and Hisilicon were still with a nm HPm node but they were already adopting the A cores Why the second generation is completely different But the second generation is completely different it will be built using nm or nm node technology and it will exploit A and A cores and an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>XMM modem Just from here the music sounds quite different we can say that it will able to face competing solutions without being slower or excessively hotter therefore it may be really convenient its production Moreover if we take a look at the preview tests things look bright the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>version is able to reach points in singlecore and points in multicore likely Geekbench Such scores would set this SoC only behind the Exynos providing better results than Snapdragon or Kirin with the latter one sharing a similar architecture Obviously it is still not known what TDP has been chosen but highend SoCs generally have a TDP around W and the Nuclun is likely to have a similar TDP The news states that LG tested two Nuclun samples from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and TSMC verifying consistent differences the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>product was able to run its A cores at GHz against the GHz of the TSMC sample at the same TDP The result is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>solution performs better by in singlethread <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>TSMC and by in multithread <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>TSMC The TDP and configuration data have not been disclosed but from an industrial and convenience point of view the only choice to make a sensible comparison would be to have the same TDP and core configuration Otherwise LG would be quite silly Such a result shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>apart from yield considerations has a better miniaturization technology and is able to provide very good performance per watt If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>strikes this deal and it is likely to do it it will set another good milestone to really enter the mobile market Being able to show an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>nm bleedingedge SoC even with ARM architecture in relation to its own modem this could be a good advertisement for its own foundry business At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a good set of solutions for the next year It will enter another set of lowend nm SoFIA solutions in early and it will successively release the new lowend and midend LTE SoFIA solutions at nm in mid while releasing the new Broxton platform with Goldmont core which will be the real highend mobile solution At that point the nm synergies and scalability will likely drive down cost per chip in conjunction with the Broadwell Xeon and Knights Landing entries We also must remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working on a new modem in order to win the iPhoneiPad or supply and it is working on sampling Apple NASDAQ AAPL Ax to see if it can win the SoC production for or more likely On top of that the company is releasing its new Knights Landing Xeon Phi solutions It is going to hit the market with its XeonFPGA combo and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Optane SSDs D XPoint next year For the nm yields even if it is not at the same level of Haswell nm the nm node is near nm values This year Intels profits were slightly reduced due to higher nm adoption but next year it is expected to grow due to better yields and scaling adoption Compared to the industry average it has a lower PE PB and PS and higher operating margin net margin ROA and ROE The only bad metrics concern the revenue and profit YoY growth which are essentially affected by the PC sales contraction But from this point of view things may have to be seen differently and they are probably going to change If we look at Q IDC data PC sales were down by more than YoY but these data do not account in for in tablets that are still PC for the majority of sales In addition Indias PC market has been recovering from Q at least in the business market Gartner stated that Windows had not any relevant impact on the third quarter since Windows was keen to upgrade already existing PCs But Q will be positive and it will show PC sales progressing with Q holiday sales in relation to the Windows rollout Theres also a survey which demonstrates that of customers are likely to purchase a new PC in the next months while only of customers are likely to do the same with tablets A positive recovery trend for US notebooks and premium ultramobile shipments is also ongoing with a probable general recovery starting from Q Even if we take into account a continuous decline in PC sales though it is unlikely Intels growth prospects are still very solid The company is set to growth steadily in the HPC Networking Workstation and storage fields while its set to massively grow in the cloud field which will account for onethird of data center revenue mix The CCG is set to partially recover next year it will exploit better profits from the mobile segment and the entire revenue and profit is set to grow in If we compare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to Qualcomm instead we see that the metrics are not so different but the PS shows something remarkable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a PS of against its industry average while Qualcomm has a PS of against its industry average Qualcomm has problems concerning lawsuits competitive pressure in the application processor and modem markets and declining royalty yield while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still pays for its smartphone nopresence and the ill PC market Even if Qualcomm has a betterthanbefore evaluation thanks to the latest share price decline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has a very big portfolio At actual prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still a buy for longterm investments more so after the dividend raise But if the target is below one year it would be better to wait for a retracement of before making additional entries The recent spikes make me think a profittaking event may be approaching Editors Note
