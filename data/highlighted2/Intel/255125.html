<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is expanding its NAND production capacity by signaling its intention to take more market share Several months ago I wrote an article outlining the tremendous opportunity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC faces in the nonvolatile memory market NAND storage and more specifically in solid state drives SSD Its no secret that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has faced several headwinds during the past few years PC sales are stagnating and with them chip sales to PC OEMs Intels efforts to win substantial share in the mobile processor market also hit a brick wall First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>missed the mobile train Then it paid heavy subsidies to win market share in the tablet market a strategy that backfired when tablet sales suddenly began to decline roughly months ago Thus despite putting enormous resources into penetrating the tablet market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>enjoyed only a shortterm increase in mobile sales Without growth its mobile business is having a hard time turning a profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to grow profitably In order to secure its longterm future it has to build on its expertise in manufacturing integrated circuits ICs In the previous article I identified the SSD market as one that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a high probability of winning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has of the market today By investing substantial resources today it can become a member of the oligopoly that will own the SSD market in the future Its important to note that Western Digital rose to the No position by acquiring SanDisk which controls of the market Seagate Western Digital and Toshiba rule the HDD market I believe the triumvirate of the SSD market will be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Samsung OTCSSNLF and Western Digital NASDAQ WDC Western Digital is thus a very interesting play but this is a topic for another article Lets put a figure on this opportunity The SSD market is expected to grow at an annual rate of for several years from B in to about B in according to this research If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wins market share just a few years from now its SSD business alone could have revenues of B This would roughly triple the companys total revenues Intels Strategy Expand and Acquire Intels competitive edge is its expertise in technology design and manufacturing By controlling both manufacturing and design <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can be one of several companies that control the entire value chain of SSDs A few weeks ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made the jawdropping announcement that it will invest up to B to transition its fab in Dalian China to nonvolatile memory TrendForce indicates the fab will have a capacity of roughly wafer starts per month According to Nomura Research of global NAND output goes to SSDs In Samsung will produce roughly wafers per month or roughly of global capacity Source Nomura Global Memory Research This means that at its initial output rate the Dalian fab can supply of the SSD market It will increase Intels SSD output by and grow the companys market share to depending on when the fab starts producing Thus the expansion strategy is visible The acquisition strategy is less clear As Western Digital demonstrated acquisition is paramount for players aiming to dominate either the HDD market or the SSD market Now that SanDisk has been acquired I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can go in several directions It can continue building its own production facilities and acquire smaller vendors and their books of business Those vendors are usually fabless and assemble SSDs from NAND they acquire from other producers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could acquire Microns NAND business This is unlikely given the structure of Microns production facility and its product mix I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>decided to invest in its own production facility because it fears Micron may be acquired by an Asian player putting at risk Intels access to Microns NAND Intels B investment in Fab shows its commitment to SSD I believe its strategy is to grow its market share toward in the first stage and to over the long haul SSD will be a core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>business and a large profit center that will supply the company with capital to grow sales and revolutionize technology in its other businesses Micron NASDAQ MU will likely suffer greatly The announcement about the Dalian fab probably caused considerable turmoil in the boardroom I truly believe Micron is getting cornered Its options will gradually fade away If Micron doesnt sell its entire business it will eventually move away from manufacturing NAND Continuously reading the business map is crucial for longterm investing I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>faces an enormous opportunity in the SSD market Its proving by its actions that it intends to make the most of it The SSD market will yield profits that the company can use to maintain leadership in the processor market and achieve success in mobile We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
