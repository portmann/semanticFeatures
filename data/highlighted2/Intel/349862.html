style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>over a licensing deal The move could vastly improve AMDs financials going forward AMD NASDAQ AMD made headlines earlier this week when a speculative report broke out reportedly from Bloomberg suggesting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is in talks with AMD to license the latters graphics technology Shortly after the vice president of AMDs Radeon Technologies group confirmed in an interview that the report perfectly lines up with the companys vision and that its indeed open to such a licensing deal Fellow SA contributor Mark Hibben quickly downplayed the report in his recent article and arrived at the conclusion that the prospective deal wont change AMDs financial trajectory But there is far more to the deal than what Mark covered in his post Lets take a closer look at both sides the upsides and caveats of this potential deal to have a better understanding of how it could impact AMDs business going forth First and foremost AMD currently generates the bulk of its revenues from selling GPUs and APUs to enterprise clients and end consumers This kind of a business operation almost always involves inventory and manufacturing risk that hurts a concerned companys financials in the form of write downs or revenue decline whenever theres an unexpected drop in hardware sales But AMDs potential licensing deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would isolate the former from these risks to an extent The licensing fee if the deal is similar to the one between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia would most likely involve a fixed annual payment for a number of years regardless of the sales volume This predictable cash flow would stabilize AMDs income make it financially leaner and also somewhat derisk its business model The second thing worth noting is that AMD wont have to boost its RD budget or capital expenditures for this prospective deal to go through The chipmaker already has the IP and it is ready for licensing Any additional licensing revenue it generates out of the already existing graphics technology would only increase its return on original investments that were made in the prior years to develop the IP In theory the chipmaker can start generating these riskfree returns almost immediately If youre a struggling company and youre getting free cash in exchange for your expertise wouldnt you take it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>paid billion to Nvidia over a period of six years for licensing its IP This averages out to an annual payment of million Assuming that AMD gets a similar deal from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with a similar annual payment structure an incremental cash inflow of this magnitude could turn AMDs financials around for good The license fee wont represent much when compared to AMDs revenues but it will have a material impact on its bottom line as highlighted in the chart below Since the deal would most likely be a multiyear agreement the financial benefits would be long lasting Source Company Financials Compiled by author This is an extension of the previous point AMD can use this cash to ramp its operations pare down some of its longterm debt burden of about billion boost its RD spending to release competitive architectures or even increase its spending to release chips based on competitive nodes If this cash goes back into business to make its products more competitive it might just trigger a virtuous cycle that results in higher sales going forward The cash from the licensing deal might also come in handy to fund AMDs ambitious goal of cracking the server segment with its upcoming ARMbased chips And lastly speaking strictly from the perspective of shareholders the stock has been in a distressed zone lately Short interest in the company has risen sharply over the past few months About million shares were short as on March th which represents a sizable of AMDs entire float This leads me to believe that any positive announcement coming from AMD like confirming the licensing deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could potentially trigger a short squeeze and result in a rally in its shares So far weve only discussed the upsides of this deal Now lets take a look at the challenges that the deal could face going forward One of the biggest concerns I have about these talks is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be using its discussions with AMD as a bargaining chip against Nvidia The IntelNvidia licensing deal expires in and theres a solid chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be in talks with AMD only to pressure Nvidia into giving it a discount If thats the case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may never go forth with AMD once Nvidia sweetens the license renewal terms Its a well known fact that AMD is shorthanded on resources If the deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is more than just licensing something on the lines of joint development of graphics technology cores to suit Intels needs it could further constrain AMDs available resources for other projects Committing significant manpower and finances to an ambitious project if at all there is one could result in delay or impact the timeliness of AMDs upcoming GPUAPU launches There also are concerns that giving away tech to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would end up making AMDs APUs less attractive This bold statement assumes that equipping AMD IP in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips would all of a sudden make the latters offerings more powerful in terms of graphical processing capabilities But this isnt necessarily true The prowess of iGPUs depends on a number of factors such as chip architectures clock speed number of transistors allocated to the unit I dont think merely switching to AMDs IP would make a drastic difference to make its entire line of APUs irrelevant After all if AMDs IP was truly so good AMD wouldve had a majority share in the discrete GPU segment Some reports suggest that this move would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to compete with AMD in the gaming console segment But until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>comes up with a custom SoC powerhouse I dont think that its a credible possibility As I just said merely deploying AMDs IP wont make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips drastically different Granted that here are some real challenges that could throw a wrench in this prospective licensing deal But if the deal goes through it would be healthy business diversification on AMDs part using its core strengths AMD will be monetizing the expertise and proprietary technology that it already has without requiring any significant capex spending It would be a big positive for AMD Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this
