media and investor communities dont get the joke on Fed policy since the crisis No change in We are silver bulls Yes thats true But before we make some money we will most probably lose some silver is a real possibility Hedge Funds Wrong Again Same as with Oil Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Andrew Zatlin via Moneyball Economics Ty Cobb was a famous baseball player Infamous really He set Major League baseball records some of which continue today He was skillful but also mean he had a reputation for playing dirty Cobb was known for spiking other players sharpening his cleats and sliding into them Nobody much liked playing against him Apple is the Ty Cobb of corporate America Like Cobb Apple has set some impressive records Nine years a trillion dollars in sales and almost no taxes paid Apple risks having a legacy of tainted success and isolation Theres a story I heard about electronics company Sharp The company was about to go bankrupt and default on some major debt This put Apple at risk since Sharp was a major source of Apples LCD screens The story goes that rather than come to Sharps aid Apple instead approached the bankers and offered to buy the factory assets after bankruptcy for pennies on the dollar of course Talk about kicking someone when theyre down True or not when I share that story with others who have dealt with Apple they shrug their shoulders and say that they arent surprised Thats the Apple way Business is not a popularity contest but when the winnertakeall crippletheotherguy approach goes too far and begins to damage the economy its time to rein things in The issue at hand is the way Apples relentless greed has undermined the US economy and damaged its future industrial competitiveness All so Apple can make more per phone After oil and cars smartphones are the US biggest import Almost B of phones was imported in per the Census Bureau Half of them were Apple iPhones The trade in smartphones cuts two ways It is singlehandedly keeping afloat the economies of China Taiwan Korea and Vietnam Korea Roughly half of Koreas IT exports are cell phone handsets or semiconductors Thus Koreas total exports are growing only as long as IT exports do For Korea with a slowing economy the smartphone is the only thing standing between them and a big recession Taiwan Its the same story but even more so because Taiwans portfolio of exports is more tied to hightech unlike Korea which also sells ships and cars Taiwans economy depends on exports which in turn depend on smartphone sales China While China has a much larger and more varied economy than Korea or Taiwan its growth is also now driven by smartphone exports to the US Chinas total exports to the US now rise and fall on the US consumers appetites for the next phone The US Loss is Everyone Elses Gain Its like an unintended Marshall Plan for the st Century The US is transferring B a year to three Asian economies creating over a million jobs and helping them accelerate up the hightech manufacturing ladder so that US jobs are now in jeopardy In other words the standard complaints about corporate America offshoring production But theres a twist the hightech competitive advantage that we are losing has bigger costlier consequences Hold on a minute you might say Assume that handing a B hightech industry to Asia cant possibly be in the USs longterm economic interest Why blame Apple For starters because Apple started the hollowing out of American semiconductor dominance and made certain that the critical jobs and manufacturing went offshore Secondly with of the US smartphone market Apple is the only company which can make an impact but it wont because that means losing per phone Nine years a trillion dollars in sales and almost no taxes paid Thats just the starting point for wondering about Apples actual contribution to the US economy Apples success drags down the US GDP The behemoth that is Apple sold almost M phones last year none of which were made in the US or used components made here Instead of exporting B in iPhones the US imported B That B swing matters in terms of balance of trade GDP and jobs If you wanted to improve the US economy theres no better place to start than with Apple and smartphones Apple undermines the US manufacturing base Assembly matters and manufacturing matters more There was a time when Apple could have assembled phones and tablets in the US but that would mean spending an extra per phone since thats approximately the extra labor cost to build that phone here instead of in Vietnam or China Assembly may not be a competitive valueadd step but it does employ a lot of people Unfortunately it would also cut Apples profits by B shrinking the companys annual net income from B to B Apple wouldnt notice a drop in profits of B because its not putting its cash to use Apple has B in cash conveniently parked outside of the US not doing anything On the other hand assembling in the US would employ tens of thousands of people A bit more productive use of capital I believe Semiconductor manufacturing is more important in the grand scheme of things Its a fact that higherskilled hightech jobs create more wealth for an economy because they lead to innovation and new product development Again Apple could have its chips made in the US by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for example Instead Apple turned to Samsung Korea and TSMC Taiwan going offshore to save another few dollars With a healthy dose of Schadenfreude one notes Apples struggles to compete with Samsung its past and present chip manufacturer When Apple turned to Samsung to manufacture chips the company also transferred vital intellectual property Samsung learned everything it needed to know to design its own chips and phones Apple saved B per year In return Samsung gained B a year in smartphone market share But while Apples greed makes it penny wise and pound foolish its the US that pays the price Shifting manufacturing of the most cuttingedge chips has permanently eroded our manufacturing base and hightech competitive edge Should the US offer a B annual manufacturing subsidy to Apple Well it actually already does except the amount is closer to B As part of Apples Zen and the Art of Freeloading Apple has found arcane tax rules that funnel sales through Ireland and dodge US taxes The Senate found that in Apple paid the IRS just B in taxes on B in sales Before someone points out that Apples success boosts US employment by a few thousand workers the US economy would get much more of a boost if Apple didnt work so hard to dodge its fair share of taxes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and US Economy Struggle Together <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand is a positive contributor to the US GDP Intels factories are largely US based Its B in annual sales means more US exports and fewer imports the exact opposite of Apple Sadly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is struggling Its sales have been flat for four years in a row and the companys product line doesnt fit consumer demand The PC world continues to stagnate and Intels semiconductor offerings are not used in the tablet smartphone and wearable device world A big part of Intels problems is that it faces competition from the very companies that Apple directly employs Samsung TSMC The result is falling production and a loss of competitive edge both of which directly reduce the US economic strength Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>canceled a new factory in Austin That was the first tangible sign that market share loss to TSMC and Samsung was taking a toll on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>lower demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products meant no need to expand production Fast forward to this month Intels latest earnings announcement included a steep reduction in capital spending a cut <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>tried to spin the CAPEX cut as a harmless thing when in fact it is a big blow to the companys future Intels entire competitive edge is determined by its ability to outproduce the competition and to be the technology leader Ultimately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is just a manufacturer Its issues are the typical problems plaguing economies of scale that come with improving production yield In the semiconductor world yield is a real estate game Semiconductors are built on mm silicon platters aka wafers and the manufacturing process follows a modern form of the lost wax casting technique lightsensitive chemicals are layered on the silicon and melted off via light This creates channels that get built up like a layer cake and eventually become the transistors and resistors The smaller you make that wavelength of light the smaller the channels and the more transistors you can pack on that wafer I call it a real estate game because its the equivalent difference between building story and story apartment buildings same land more money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has always been ahead of the pack when it comes to shrinking the light wavelength It can crank out more chips per wafer and has more factories to do the cranking This enabled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to control the pace at which the industry shifted to smaller wavelengths For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>it meant profit maximization because the company effectively dictated pricing and timing Well not any more Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>faces stiff competition from Samsung and TSMC both of whom can produce at similar volumes and using similar cuttingedge technologies Thats really what the CAPEX cut meant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has lost control Its incredibly difficult to regain control when you have not one but two aggressive rivals The big problem here is that the US lacks an industrial policy China Taiwan and Koreas governments very clearly understand the economic importance of hightech design and production The US government not so much China fully understands the importance of hightech jobs and especially semiconductors it has earmarked B in direct subsidies or investments as they euphemistically deem them This isnt steel or cement Whoever produces the semiconductor chips has an edge with hightech devices and that means trillions of dollars Im not suggesting that the US become protectionist In some ways this is just another industry where our trading partners subsidize and incentivize local design and development and penalize foreign imports and production all while the US government does nothing Except this time it is different The US ability to make more or fewer cars was an economic and jobs issue The US ability to stay competitive in the semiconductor space is a national security issue Semiconductors are the engines for hightech products like super computers Having the most powerful super computers is the linchpin of the US national security platform This is why its also an area of prime focus for the Chinese government With hightech determining the economic growth of every country enabling another nation to be more competitive makes no sense What is the burden of having Apple be the best it can be Nine years a trillion dollars in sales and almost no taxes paid And while Apple helps Samsung and TSMC build factories in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is shuttering factories in the US I have no issue with corporate greed per se more often than not theres a balance with the public good lower prices better products and services When things become imbalanced it falls on us as a society to realign things We need to step in here First boycott Apple products If you buy an Android phone you can take comfort in knowing that some of that money comes back to the US via Google which does a lot to support the US economy Second lets encourage Congress to close the tax loopholes that let companies like Apple hide from taxes Third dont support a oneoff tax moratorium on cash brought in from offshore These companies are dying to bring the money back anyway They dodged taxes to get it offshore and now they want to continue dodging them to bring it back No way Thu Oh regional Indian Apple with bite taken out enslaving humanity Thu LawsofPhysics Apple is the problem At least they make something fucking real no mention of useless fucking paperpushing bankers and financiers Thanks to their politcal puppets and attorneys they dont pay taxes either you stupid fuck Thu DonutBoy You are so right I dont use Apple products I dont like closed systems but they make things people love and they make good margin on them Good for them Theyre supposed to do what Hand money over to inept managers of dying companies Use the most expensive contract manufacturers Wake up Apple is a business We need more Apples less banks Thu LawsofPhysics Bingo given that there is no real collateral behind money creation anymore banks are nothing but useless fucking middlemen between a printer and everyone else customer and producer in the real economy Kill the fuckers already Thu buzzsaw fucking a stop blaming the craapl maggots every dumb mother fucker in this country who buys their overpriced crap products and stocks is what causes this fuck it they deserve the screwing let it burn Thu Comte dherblay Corporations pay no taxes When will you get it thru your thick heads that Apple customers will wind up paying the taxes in higher prices for an apple product or service You wooly headed taxers need to take a course in economics accounting and cost accounting b displaying for all the world to see your total ignorance I dont own but one IPAD I dont care about I phones and other apple products but if I did I would be certain that apple would have ME paying the taxes you think are being paid by Tim Cook Your headline should read When will government control prices so that corporations do not pass their taxes on to their customers Thu LawsofPhysics At the very least Id be happy when corporations that dont produce something of real fucking value or whos value and shareholder wealth gets gutted by management actually go fucking bankrupt and those managers go to prison In the absence of any kind rule of law we go back to the freeforall of dark ages only a matter of time Thu KnuckleDraggerX Since Steve Jobs augured in his reality distortion field has disappeared Now questions are starting to be asked but AAPL is one of the stocks used to levitate Wall St All we can hope is the hipsters to go away and let Apple slowly implode Thu cornflakesdisease Thu richiebaby
