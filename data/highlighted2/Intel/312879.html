At A Dead End With PC Processors Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMDs Carrizo processors target the most important segment of the PC market notebooks Carrizo significantly underperforms Intels Skylake but also costs less During the earnings conference call on January AMDs NASDAQ AMD management made clear that gaining market share in the PC client space was an objective for the new year AMDs Carrizo notebook processors are the linchpin of this strategy targeted at the all important segment However systems running Carrizo will not be competitive with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC notebooks in performance but will cost about the same Carrizo could become just the latest in a string of financial setbacks for AMD AMDs Carrizo laptop processors were very deliberately aimed at the most important segment of the PC industry According to the chart above from AMD the notebook segment represented nearly a quarter of all PC sales in and of all notebooks Carrizo is a system on chip SOC similar to the SOCs in mobile devices such as smartphones Its design includes an onboard graphics processor dual CPU cores as well as peripheral interfaces The highly integrated SOC was supposed to provide performance improvement along with greater battery life It was nearly a year ago that AMD revealed Carrizo to the world Although Carrizo would be manufactured on the same process node nm as the previous generation AMD promised significant architectural improvements But it wasnt clear how Carrizo would stack up against the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake processors fabricated on Intels much superior nm FinFET process It didnt seem that architectural improvements alone could bridge the performance gap of two process generations Late in the year as more and more Skylake processors hit the market I was still wondering how Carrizo would compare There didnt seem to be any systems on the market and test data was sketchy As of the September quarter earnings report I could only find a single review of a Carrizo system On the basis of the limited data I predicted that Carrizo would be dead on arrival The new year has finally seen the arrival of Carrizo in laptops from companies such as HP NYSE HPQ and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY along with the most comprehensive review were likely to see of Carrizo laptops in Anandtech Well calling the Anandtech article a review may be something of a misnomer mournful eulogy might be more accurate The author seems genuinely reluctant to break the news of how bad Carrizo is compared to Skylake When he finally gets around to it after separate web pages its truly bad In every single benchmark Skylake processors with the same power rating as Carrizo were better by a large margin usually better The Carrizo and Skylake processors tested both included onboard graphics but even AMDs much vaunted graphics were no match for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors Of course the AMD processors are quite a bit less expensive with Anandtech indicating a price of less that for AMD vs about for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with variations depending on specific processor It can be argued that AMD processors offer slightly better performancecost compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>However this cost differential isnt being reflected in the system cost to the consumer The best way to see this is to look at the few systems that are offered in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD versions but are otherwise identical For instance the Lenovo Ideapad AMD version starts at while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>version starts at The HP Pavilion z Touch Laptop AMD version starts at while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>version starts at Why would the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>version be less expensive This could be due to the difference in manufacturing volume between the two versions and its possible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is offering special discounts as well Given the very important market segment that Carrizo was intended to address I think its reasonable to conclude that Carrizo was intended to be the principal vehicle by which AMD would achieve greater PC market share in However its a poor vehicle for that purpose Whatever cost advantage Carrizo may have is swamped by the notebook system costs and the cost advantage doesnt reach the consumer All the consumer is going to see are systems of comparable cost but very different performance AMD has given consumers an easy choice and its not Carrizo AMDs next generation processor architecture known as Zen offers some hope of being truly competitive It will be fabricated on a nm FinFET process probably by Global Foundries Zen also will feature other architectural advancements At the January earnings call AMD was a little vague about the release of Zen but appeared to confirm that volume production would not start until That leaves Carrizo to carry the ball this year I believe Carrizo has all the makings of a financial disaster for AMD It wont increase market share or PC revenue but it will end up costing a bundle in inventory write downs and purchase commitments for Carrizo wafers the company doesnt need In my article on AMDs December quarter earnings I concluded that trying to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in x architecture devices is a dead end I believe that Carrizo rather than being a vehicle of market share growth will be the vehicle that demonstrates that AMD has reached a dead end in PC processors I continue to rate AMD a sell Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the
