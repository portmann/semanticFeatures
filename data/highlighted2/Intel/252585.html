<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Brian Krzanich sitting to immediate left For the keynote presentation this afternoon we are going to run through about minutes of a fireside chat Ill kick things off with some questions if we have some time at the end well open up to the audience before we start though Ive been asked by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>just to read the Safe Harbor Statement Todays presentation contains forwardlooking statements All statements made that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially Please refer to our most recent earning release Q and K for more information on the risk factors that could actually result that could cause actually results to differ If we use any nonGAAP financial measures during the presentation you will find that on Intels Web Site intelcom the required reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures And with that why dont we go ahead and kick things off Brian you were appointed CEO in May of so youve been on the job for a little over years I am kind of curious if you can take a step back and look at kind of the big changes you think youve implemented in the Company over the last years What were the challenges you thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had when you came into the job and how did you address those challenges Sure John I think if you take a look at the Company there is a couple of challenges that when I walked in and we really started working on this Weve faced some of them more technical challenges and some of them I would say were culture challenges The technical challenges as in like that we were I think the biggest issue is we were primarily a one product company We were PC focused all of our effort was on reviving the PC and that was our great hope for the future And I think weve done a very good job in most of the areas Id say okay what are the other areas of growth we can go faster how do we go put investments in there how do we go beef up their capabilities and so I really feel right now what weve been able to do is really drive the Company to the what I call multicylinder engine that theyre not all Id say the same CC of our capabilities yet but we have the PC which we built a model around of how to try and stabilize it But then said that the growth engines are going to be the datacenter which is the primarily largest one its a billion business and then weve got the IoT space and memory and we built a nice virtuous circle that shows how all of these feed each other within IP and data and just ecosystem around That was the technical part the cultural part has been around then also shifting the investments telling people where were going to push dollars if you take a look at the amount of spending we have on the PC is come down probably or during that time weve moved those spending either direct back to the shareholders or often to these other investment areas thats been a big shift for the company Going back to the growth I mean I think over the last three to five years investors have been willing to rewards companies for cutting cost executing on financial MA and returning cash to shareholders the last of those you guys have done a really good job at but youve also shown a very strong willingness to invest in your organic growth you spent billion plus or minus a year on CapEx billion on RD you did probably one of the biggest strategic MAs in the industry with Altera You look at the mobile losses that youve been incurring even as you take those mobile losses down youve been reinvesting them into other parts of the business I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how you think about growth investment and profitability and the trade of each I think especially anytime youre trying to move a company like we are from a single product company into these other growth areas you have to be willing to make these investments these new areas of growth dont just come out of the earth and pop up you have to invest in them And if you take a look at lets take a look at the D Xpoint Memory that was a ten year investment that we made over this period of time and many of us have been working on that technology for several years before it was really ready to be kind of to be birthed ph over this year So it takes time and it takes money to invest into these especially in the technologies that we have So when I look at that spending that you just described portion of it is around the core which is Moores Law Most of that CapEx is going towards feeding Moores Law the current capacity and the future development tools The rest of it is feeding these new businesses more and more both of the data center the IoT space and the memory space Brian on that front how do we think about longer term operating margins for the company in the context of have you desire to growth right because youve done a fantastic job this year cutting mobile losses you promised million you gave us billion At Analyst Day two weeks ago you gave us you promised another million for but if you look at the savings youre getting there youre reinvesting them in the datacenter youre reinvesting them into IoT so is this sort of a transitory investment thats going to have leverage at some point and do you think youre running the company at the appropriate operating model for the growth you desire I think well always make these investments as long as we believe we can turn them into something thats growth if you take a look at where were moving those investments were moving those investments towards other areas of mobile so G where one of the things we said we were going to grow in the datacenter one of the biggest growth area is the networking space and a large portion of that is going to go through transitions over the next few years as it goes through G and thats going to provide a lot of opportunity And what we find is as we go in and talk to the service providers the careers the equipment manufacturers if you have to modem you have the endtoend solutions your conversation with them is much more incredible youre in the game and theyre talking with you And we believe that we can grow significantly in the networking space for example So I think when you get back to your question about operating margin yes Im going to go invest in those spaces as long as I believe I can turn that into growth for the shareholder So our model is always investing in business first Andrew Bryant taught me very clearly many years ago there is just a simple model for what to do with your cash there is three things you invest in the business as long as you believe you can give a higher return to the shareholder than they can otherwise otherwise you go back and you do it through buyback and dividends and its very clear to those and so we do that analysis constantly And what are the growth aspirations I will put you on the hook a little bit for Stacys napkin math at Analyst Day where you talked about three different scenarios for PC unit growth longer term and what you think you could do for total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>revenue under those three scenarios so maybe you can talk a little bit about what the growth aspirations are So lets go back first and try to indiscernible people that reference point So we spend some time I think when you go develop a growth scenario for a company like this you go to test it under various market conditions because the last thing you want to do is go tell your board or the investment community Im going to grow and grow in a certain way and then the market shifts so the economies and macro shifts and youre like having to explain yourself So we actually did this test on our own to really evaluate how credible our story was to ourselves and what that was was we said if you look at our growth rate that we believe we can do in the datacenter and IoT and in memory we look out over the next four to five years if we can keep the PC lets call it flattish to as long as nice to then we can be a growth company in the mid to higher single digit growth rates if youre or lower in to decline in the PC then we are going to be in a low single digits to closer to and then greater than decrement in the PC and greater we start to become a flat growth company So that was the model we trusted and we trusted ourselves do we believe we can keep the PC above and we said yes about decline So that made it so that I could stand in front of a room like this and say creditably I am not betting the company and the growth engine on growth ph in PC if I can turn the in the PC thats a great deal but Id effect ph the growth of this company on actually a decline PC market and I think that has credibility to an audience As a result I think we can stay in that midsingle digits range is it four five six seven I am not sure I think there is going to be years when the datacenter does a little bit better than I predicted and the PC does as well and we will be in the high single digits there will be years when the data centers is not quite as good because theyve overstepped ph whatever an over grown and the PC does a little bit worst then we will be in those low single digits But over that long time that broader region I think we can stand those midsingle digit of growth So Brian what most people in the room and on the webcast believe that PC is probably your biggest liability because everyone believes its either a structurally stagnant market or structurally declining market youve got a little bit of different deal Im wondering if you can talk about kind of the scale in PCs the shared IP across and how important that business is to the overall growth strategy of the company Sure I did this test with my board I said okay Ill sell you either business for The datacenter business or the PC business And then we go through a discussion and then I say anybody who bought the datacenter business in five years Ill put out of business with the PC business The PC provides a couple of things right now now if I go five to years out five to seven years out my argument falls apart hopefully But right now the PC provides the scale right it provides billion of revenue it provide the large volume its fund the Moores Law the IP generation of the cores all of the addon IPs of memory controllers and networking and all of the other IP its such a huge generator all of that intellectual property And so for right now that is the engine of the company it feeds into the data center If you take a look at the products we run in the data center if you look at the core products that are in the IoT right now theyve all feed off of that IP thats been generated either in the silicon or in the architecture from the PC I believe that will shift as we go into the next decade that the datacenter maybe the generator of most of the IP or they may be more shared between those two and my argument falls apart but right now that PC is a huge asset to the company that provides the scale and volume And thats what I think is one of the things that separates thats our competitors Cant do a key note with CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>without talking about Moores Law this is the th anniversary of the observation that said over the last couple of years Moores Law has been a little bit more difficult to implement for both the nanometer and the nanometer node youve moved from sort of a two year cadence to a two and a half year cadence And its led some investors to question whether or not your advantage over the other manufactures TSMC and Samsung are still in place and I know the compares are difficult because youre usually comparing apples and oranges when you look at different processes across fabs but talk a little bit about whether or not you believe you still have that advantage and will be able to maintain that advantage Sure first thing you said it John Moores Law is years old and if you take a look at the history of Moores Law its not spent much of its life at two year cycle actually the majority of it life has been two and a half to three years Sun Lin Chao ph who used to run our TV department drove it to two years during a very unique opportunity unique time when lithography tools were progressing quite nicely thats when the steppers really came into fashion and the wavelengths of light were going down nicely Basically whats slowing down Moores Law is two things right now UV is light it should have probably coming optimally some people will argue a nanometers I actual argue probably at nanometers out in that time frame thats really when we started to need UV when we were multipatterning and what that does is extends the length of the process the number of mask layers is more than doubled over the last five years so it takes longer to do developments it takes longer to do defect reduction So thats what happened here I believe over the next five years the lithography tools will start to catch up we will see whether it stays at two and half year or we can get it back two were going to keep pushing back to two if we can We still believe we have a lead it doesnt matter whether its two years or two and a half years thats what drove that leadership was our ability to develop these technologies the creative ways we do the material science the lithography tricks that we do for multipatterning thats all going to go In fact its going to become more important as we move forward so whats actually given us the lead will become more important as we move forward I believe And if you take a look it actually D transistors weve been making them for four or five years the competition is just coming out with them now this year So we talk about how do you compare technologies You have to really both compare on the geometric level and the material science level now a days So Im pretty comfortable that well continue our leadership but it is getting harder and so I think thats again one of the kind of I had this belief about our industry that there is intellectual property in these IPs that are becoming verified ph I believe Moores Law as one of those but there is others like the modems there is very few people making modems Some of the memory development were doing leading edge CPU architectures all of those things are becoming kind of fewer and less players in that You stated earlier that youre not betting the future growth of the Company on the PCs That said weve got a pretty powerful product cycle on two fronts on PCs in the near term One is Windows two is Skylake coming out in broader availability We had a pretty weak PC year in year knowing that things like endoflife of Windows XP last year difficult compares maybe a weaker macro can you help us understand what your outlook is for the PC market over the next months and especially given that youve got million million PCs in the installed base that are older than years to years why cant we expect to see a couple years of positive midsingle digit unit growth in the PC market So I am behind you John Id love to see that as it would make my job a lot earlier I also am a pragmatist and so I am very careful about betting the Company on that So thats why I always explained why we did that testing That said our job is to try and create that I do think you are right we moved from a world where there was headwind there was an Osborne like effect that occurred as Windows was coming and Skylake was coming everybody knew it We had just finished the Windows XP endoflife right and so those things I think slowed down the PC in the first half Windows is just taking off now theyve crossed over I know million uses its just taking off Skylakes just taking off and the number of systems out there the form factor that youre going to see youre going to see a lot more form factors as we go into next year really some very creative one I am optimistic and there is one other thing is that the whole ecosystems is probably working together tighter than ever before So I dont know if youve seen the commercials on TV the PC does what commercials thats an industry consortium That is a I mean when was the last time youd thought youd see HP Dell Lenovo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Microsoft all standing and putting money behind a unified marketing campaign to get people to see what the new features and capability of the PC are To get to that million to million units of systems that are greater than or years old thats our objective So I think youve got the industry consortium everybody trying to put all the innovative engines they can around it youve got Win and youve got Skylake all working together Were optimistic internally were trying to push to that low single digit growth were just being very careful of what we promised to the street though Speaking inside of CCG just talking about the mobile business you took down losses more than your promised at the beginning of the year this year now a lot of that I wouldnt say was easy but it was not necessarily depended upon revenue growth it was taking down subsidies it was selling fewer tablets with constant revenue as you look at sort of the million in savings you promised next year how much of that is sort of growth dependent cost on new product dependent and I guess importantly because this is the question I want to ask why are you in this business longer term the number one player is having a difficult time with profitability is breakeven good enough for this business longer term because it gives you IP you can leverage in the other markets so do you think this is absolutely a profit adding business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>longer term I certainly dont want to lose money thats for sure If it ended up as a breakeven business and thats all I could do I would still say this is a business that you as a shareholder want me to be at now and Ill explain why I would say that so lets talk about first how we got here Weve actually done quite a bit of work so there is a couple of other things I am very proud of as a leader of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and really as an engineer more so than the leader And that is the rate at which we put out revenue ph products so if you take a look youre right a certain amount of the cost reduction was the melding of the two groups the efficiencies youve got there We did we will end up shipping probably fewer tablets and phones this year Actually well probably end up selling more phones fewer tablets than last year but the time of markets down But the large part of the offset was eliminating the subsidies but that was you know people didnt just say okay well stop taking the subsidy we had to get a product out there that didnt require subsides So we put Sofia in the market in roughly about a year year and half So when was it that youd see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>say I going to produce a product and it would be in market a year and year and half later weve done that with Sofia we did that with Quark we announced Curie at CES of this year its already sampling So Im very happy with the speed at which were getting products out there now and the kinds of products were able to put out there that are targeted towards this Next year weve got some more cost reduction some products shifts as we bring some other again lower cost we can actually start to make some money But I think here is why mobile is so important and this is the discussion I had with my board At the end of the day we got to get this as profitable as we can but even if in this space it ends up being roughly breakeven its our gateway remember I said to get into that networking space to sit down with Huawei with Ericsson with a Verizon and Deutsche Telekom and all of these guys that are players on that space you have to be on both ends of this network in order to be considered relevant And if were going to grow in the networking space which is a very profitable space and a space that we have very low market share right now and its moving towards our the network function virtualization our software defined networking in that space its playing right into our heads we have to be there On the other side remember this is this virtuous circle modems play a virtuous circle as well so they play on the networking side and get you in there They also if you think about IoT the only difference between IoT and embedded is that IoT devices are connected Its when youre fishfinder can go out on to the cloud and download the most recent data of whats been caught on that lake thats when youre fish finder that used to be just a simple embedded product becomes an IoT device And now youre passing data to the cloud as well thats like the simplest most basic example of IoT But it really demonstrates that youve got to have connectivity So if youre going to play in IoT which includes everything from the old embedded type product through industrial robotics all of these devices youve got to have connectivity And so if we dont have that capability then we get locked out of those deals and thats a huge growth engine we want to be in too So I look at it as yes I need to get as good as I can get in the tablet and phone space but more important this modem needs to fund my access into these other two spaces Brian one of the motes of PC business is the ecosystem you can also make the argument that one of the issues youve had breaking into mobile is that you hadnt been part of the ecosystem nearly as long as in the PC space Does that start to change at G and I think its kind of important we have to talk about that fact that youre actually on the G standard board trying to push standard how important is that to the success in the modem business longer term Its massively important because there are other organizations out there trying to build proprietary lockins on various segments of the network that if were not part of those boards and in there that well get locked out of and that was one of the things Id say one of the other things were doing differently lets go back to G and G <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>tried to take a different path and it was separate we didnt participate in things like GSMA we didnt participate in the standard boards we tried to drive our own standards and at the end we got locked out And it took us several years to get back in and were in now with LTE and were capable thats not going to happen were going to make sure that were a part of it Im now an active member with the GSMA and Im there Im going to be at Mobile World Congress now an active player there this year We our relationships I just did a trip to Europe about a month ago I didnt meet with a single PC supplier it was all Telco all service provider all building those relationships of the discussions toward G in the future So I believe G is a great transition point and an opportunity for us to make it and even playing field Im going to preferences this question by highlighting the fact that your growth target on DCG is not a growth target you expect to hit quarter in quarter out its sort of a longer term target That said why are you so confident I mean it doesnt take an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>engineer to understand growing at CAGR off of billion base is a lot easier than growing at a CAGR at a billion to billion base where the business is today so why the optimism around continuing to grow with that sort of midteens level Its me and maybe its my visibility that I have into it so when I look at the cloud I mean the big driver of this is the cloud and the cloud is now growing if you take a look at our datacenter you cant think of the datacenter anymore at this glomeration of one big server rack or something You really have to look at it as the business segment So there is the enterprise datacenter theres the cloud there is the highperformance computing HPC there is these various segments The cloud is significantly its the fastest growing and now becoming equal to the enterprise in size and probably over the next two years will pass the enterprise If you take a look at the cloud as today and I know a lot of people I get asked a lot is the cloud growth over Are we done How many more people can join Facebook and all The way I look at it today is the cloud of today is all created by people the data that gets into the cloud the data that gets used and assumed by the cloud is produced by people The cloud of the future is going to be produced by machines and its that cloud driven by machines thats going to be multiples as big as the cloud of today And the example I give is imagine if we start to connect just in your house if I compare the number of people in your house versus the number of things Ill be able to connect in your house and we did a study were doing a study we took just people and we put basis watches on them we put smart weight scales on the theyre collecting health data were doing heath cardiovascular health study with one of the large universities and some people volunteers Those people are generating million data points a day a day So you think about how and my guess is those people are producing some Facebook tweets things like that in the cloud Tens of thousands they are producing million data points into the cloud of just their personal data Then you start thinking about thats not connecting their home and thinking about technical difficulty and everything else You start thinking about the industrial connectivity that were going to do robotics drone all of this stuff thats going to fuel the cloud of the future and its going to be a multiple of the size that it is today I think one of the most optimistic targets you gave at Analyst Day couple of weeks ago was the growth you expect in the networking business in its about what about billion business for you today How important is exploiting that market that TAM relative to that CAGR and why you confident with things like SDN and NFV that youll be able to do that So there is a couple of reasons one our market share is relatively low so I do have the law of small numbers helping in that space People see our market share in the datacenter again they say how much growth could you have in networking but our networking percentages are then less than So there is a lot of growth there The second thing is as I talk to our customers I talk to the industry in general they are seeing the cost reduction from NFV and SDN and theyre seeing the same kinds of what weve seen in the datacenter in general the cloud and the enterprise section where virtualization software definition general purpose CPUs lower cost generic systems as they enter really reduce their cost They are seeing the same thing and they are starting to ask the same kind of questions they are leap frogging actually into some of the more advanced structures that we are seeing in the cloud for cost reduction they are asking why cant we just jump right to there and that plays right into our technical capability our skill set our intellectual property everything So we thats why I am so confident I have got the law of small numbers working for me and I have got this cost reduction that our customers are seeing and demanding now pulling the customers are pulling us Similar question relative to the Altera acquisition especially given the valuation billion for the asset how important is the Altera to the DCG strategy and help us understand what do you think the reasonable payback time is on that acquisition Sure so lets first talk about what were the three fundamental reasons weve bought Altera One is that if you take a look at that technology FPGAs they like CPUs benefit nicely from Moores Law and there is strong data that suggests that the percentage ph the company thats had leadership position first products on the first node you have to have the right design right architectural point and all but theyve tended to gain share So we believe we can add to their architectural capabilities and their Moores Law capabilities to grow the base business at a faster rate That was the fundamental first reason The second reason is there are significant workloads in the datacenter that are greatly enhanced by taking the software and putting it right to the FPGA and the one I gave as an example is something like facial search and if I want to do a facial search using all the Facebook data on the planet and see when two people are standing together next to the ocean whatever the facial search I want to do I want to use pictures to find all of those photos If I take that software and drop it down into the FPGA and basically run it on silicon rather than run it outside in memory I can get to performance improvement from that Can either be lower power or high performance thats significant So we have customers that are requesting this capability The last place is things like IoT so its got beyond again there is this virtual circle we look for these IP in probably in multiple sectors Think places like ADAS where assisted driving where youve got very complex millions and millions of lines in the code managing the complex nature of all the sensors and the sensor hubs managing driverless driving Taking that software and putting it down in the FPGA again drives performance power and cost reductions as a result So we thinking in multiple segments we can both grow the base business and move it faster into these new segments That was fundamentally what we said was the thesis behind us We think we can do a payoff on that direct investments fairly quickly I dont think weve come out yet and said the timing for exactly when to the shareholders partially were being a little cautious Where we have to leave treat them as a separate company now and not talk too much about their financials but I think in next years investor meeting you should expect us to and you shall hold us accountable for really talking about this assumingly we close I want to say one other thing because you and I we are kind of talking about it outside I think its a lot of skepticism on Intels ability to do an acquisition and I think within this room it should be rightfully so Id say that one of the other things that Im proud of the team that we have at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>over the last two years two and half years is really improve the performance in Mcafee which was the other big investment we did which Ill be completely transparent wasnt performing as well as it should We hired a new leader with Chris Young great guy hired him out of Cisco just a strong leader knows this business very accountable We fully integrated the organizations so theyre part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now theyve been held separate If you take a look at the last couple of quarters our costs are down Our performance in revenue is up and weve actually shown growth over the last few quarters And we believe as we go into we continue to can continuously see it as a growth company now So weve made these improvements So were taking that same learnings and applying it right up upfront to Altera So I can tell you my Board is holding me accountable that this will not be another bad acquisition One just curious quickly over to IoT you gave a minute keynote presentation at IDF this year and there were a lot of robots and drones I didnt see any new PC form factors I think youre one the first CEOs of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to make a regular standard that fashion week in New York multiple speakers You love going to Maker Faire in fact youre sponsoring a reality TV show I think next year The Worlds Greatest Makers youre confusing a lot of investors because people want to know why youre spending so much time on of your revenue given that your average selling price is and the perception is IoT is all about microchip how do you actually turn the profit in this business what are we missing So I think there is a couple of things that you have to think through when you see these areas In it Ill take an extreme point of view or extreme view if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>didnt grow at all in IoT but our presence there caused IoT to increase its growth rate Remember all of that data feeds up into the cloud So I dont even need to be a part of that IoT space in order to profit us the IoT So again that big second cylinder is the datacenter So I look for anything that feeds the datacenter and I try and feed that Now in IoT I believe I can participate but youre right used an example where we did an installation in a retail store they are RFID tags Were not going to play in those devices There is the sensors that measure those we do build those There is the network hub that takes all that data and manages it were playing there and in the big datacenter back at the headquarters were playing there Why do I also want to be a part of this One of the things that frustrated me as an engineer in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and this is one of those longterm investments that you guys have to trust me on as shareholders I look out at the universities I look out at these Maker Faire and these are the people that are going to be the inventors of the technology in years years and none of them are working on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x architecture They were all working on ARM Weve lost touch with the community that was going to be the next people who invent the next great machine that we all love and use I have to go back and get those people in touch with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>see that there is a technology that there is a capability that they cannot match anywhere else on the planet That is why we developed Quark We developed Quark several of us development it about years ago quietly it was a secret project that nobody knew at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was funded I actually funded that out of the factory budget not the architectural budget for years And we specifically wanted to get in there because Ive got to change the knowledge and the culture of the next generation they got to know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>they got to design their apps on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because even if theyre not going to be a hardware guy theyre going to be a software person theyve got to develop on x they got to want to development on our architecture or we will be locked out of the future You wont feel that for years to years but as an engineer I saw that coming You want me there and you want me changing their perception of our architecture Brain I want to finish with one last question on memory The guy who had your job before you spent a considerable amount of time actually trying to minimize the negative financial impact of mems ph Youre kind of moving in an opposite direction with Dalian both on the D NAND and on Xpoint why are you so optimistic about your ability to play in that market and I guess importantly how do you minimize the cyclicality of that industry and even by Stacys slide at Analyst Day Op margins in that business today are sub you know why are you so bullish about growing revenues so aggressively in that market at a Op margin or do you see some light at the end of the tunnel where profitability is a lot better than it is today and why Sure so would tell you that if all of the business if the future of that business was purely NAND whether its D NAND or D NAND I wouldnt have changed the business model The business model works quite nicely between us and Micron right now and we have restructured it such that the cyclicality is muchmuch less for us as players in that market What significantly changed it for me was SXP ph or you guys know it as D Xpoint By the way we always change the codenames as we go through these things to confuse the engineers and the public This is a very unique architecture it truly shifts the way memory is done It has to of the speed of DRAM while having the nonvolatility and cost structure much more like NAND and it allows us to architect a whole new type of memory storage hierarchy and so remember I said my whole theme around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is IPs they can be shared across these virtuous cycle Well if such go to things like Big Data Big Data is huge amounts of data hence its name Big Data and the more of that processing the more closely you can attach the data to the processing then much faster those Big Data analytics occurred We believe that we can get multiple orders of magnitude improvement in Big Data applications by taking D Xpoint where we can now take terabytes of data and move it right next to the CPU and have it act much more like memory rather than storage and so were building an architecture that we believe will shift how datacenters are built in the future and thats why its a unique technology that links directly with the CPU we believe we have a significant leadership over the competition and thats why were going to go and investing there I need to grow in that market will we be a longterm player in that I think we have to let it play out over the next five to seven years and see whether others come in whether somebody else has another ability to copy the technology well let it play out and well be careful about how big the investment is but for right now we believe we
