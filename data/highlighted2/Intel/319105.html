class='textDiv'>Immersion Sues Apple Implications For The Samsung Relationship Immersion Corporation NASDAQIMMR Seeking Alpha Haptic feedback developer Immersion is suing Apple for infringing some of their foundational haptic feedback patents The move doesnt come completely unexpected as Immersions largest shareholder had suggested such action was necessary during the last conference call The expiry of Samsungs multiyear license at the end of also may have contributed to the timing of the lawsuit We see the move both as offensive as well as defensive Immersion needs to take action to launch a signal to its existing and potential licensees infringing wont be allowed We see a Samsung renewal now as more likely Immersions action against Apple is certainly a move Samsung may only benefit from Last week Immersion Corporation NASDAQ IMMR announced that it had filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission ITC against Apple NASDAQ AAPL ATT NYSE T and ATT Mobility LLC as well as a patent infringement complaint in the US District Court for the District of Delaware against the same parties The lawsuit states that the haptic feedback systems of the Apple iPhone Plus iPhone s Plus and WatchWatch SportWatch Edition infringe upon two of IMMR patents and the iPhone s and s Plus allegedly infringe upon a third patent Apples description of D touch a picture which is also part of Immersions patent infringement complaint in the US District Court After announcing the lawsuit against Apple Immersion held an investor conference call to resume the main reasons behind this move During the call Immersions CEO Vic Viegas commented Immersion is the leading innovator of haptic technology For more than years we have invented designed promoted and commercialized haptic feedback technologies that bring digital experiences to life Through decades of research development efforts and business activity Immersion has built a farreaching and deep worldwide portfolio of over issued or pending patents covering many of the foundational aspects and commercial applications of haptic technology With these comments it is quite obvious that Immersion is trying to distance itself from the so called patent trolls that often buy patents of relative value and try to enforce their rights against accused infringers far beyond the patents actual value or contribution to the prior art If we look at Immersions history we can almost consider it as a university spin off that benefited from government funding in addition to private sources to advance research in a new field This case study describes how SBIR grants helped a young company develop a large intellectual property portfolio centered on adding the sense of touch to diverse computer applications It illustrates how government funding can be used by a university spinoff to leverage funding from private sources to achieve faster growth eventually essentially eliminating the need for government RD support The case also illustrates how a basic idea adding the sense of touch to computer applications can be used to enhance entertainment experiences increase productivity of computer use train doctors and more Immersions technology was inspired by a NASA system but its growth centers on its embodiment in consumer products The case provides a number of suggestions for improving the SBIR program Given Immersions background it should come as no surprise that management is describing its patent portfolio as foundational to haptic IP For those interested here is the description of the three patents that are part of Immersions lawsuit The patent relates to haptic feedback in handheld electronic devices that have a touchscreen The patent teaches among other things systems and methods for providing tactile sensations including displaying a graphical object on a touchscreen receiving a sensor signal indicating an object contacting the touchscreen determining an interaction between the object contacting the touchscreen and the graphical object generating an actuator signal based at least in part on the interaction and haptic effect data in a lookup table and outputting a haptic effect to an actuator based at least in part on the actuator signal The patent relates to haptic feedback in handheld electronic devices The patent teaches among other things systems and methods for generating haptic feedback including storing a plurality of predefined haptic effects that are accessible to multiple applications via an application programming interface receiving a request for a predefined haptic effect from an application retrieving the requested effect via the application program interface generating a drive signal based on the effect and applying the drive signal to an actuator to provide a haptic effect The patent relates to haptic feedback in electronic devices The patent teaches among other things systems and methods of producing a haptic effect including receiving first and second gestures signals generating a dynamic interaction parameter using the signals and applying a drive signal to a haptic output device according to the dynamic interaction parameter We are no patent experts but these descriptions seem to lay the case for the infringement of basic haptic effects patented by Immersion that are found in Apple products In the lawsuit Immersion is reminding the court that Apple should be aware of IMMRs patents including without limitation through Defendants knowledge of Immersion knowledge that many Apple competitors in the mobile space have licensed Immersions patented technology and Immersions disclosure of its patents on its website We would add to this list the fact that several patents recently filed by Apple in the haptic field reference previous Immersions foundational patents During Immersions Q conference call Immersions largest shareholder RIMA Senvest urged the company to take action against Apple to defend its IP as we underlined in a previous article So were very very upset with Apples action that they seem set to introduce these products and not compensate you guys And Id love to see you guys go after them get an injunction and have them stop shipping the iPhone s into the United States Were just serious about this I just want to say that were right behind you being your largest shareholder and were looking forward to our day in court here against Apple who we believe has been stealing our technology We were around when you guys sued and successfully won against Sony NYSE SNE and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and won hundreds of millions of dollars And that was just for some features on video games Now were talking about billions of products using haptics from cell phones to tablets to laptops So our view is that your company your technology today its worth at least billion And we were very disappointed that Apples chosen to steal the technology rather than pay you for it There are certainly several factors that contributed to Immersions decision to proceed against Apple including as noticed the strong input from prominent shareholders However we do not believe that Immersion is telling the complete story in their commentary about the timing of the lawsuit As Ive given some indication in the past a strategy develops based on the products the infringing acts the status of the IP developing a team And so we felt that it has come together Its reached the point where we believe that the best course of action for us is to defend our IP in the ITC and in the District Court and so we feel like its timings right We feel really good about the case and were excited to proceed vigorously At the end of Samsungs OTCSSNLF multiyear license came to an end and the two companies havent come yet to an agreement to renew it The lack of a timely renewal has been in our opinion the main reason behind Immersions stock weakness since the start of At this stage starting a lawsuit against Apple may certainly put additional positive pressure on Immersions efforts to renew with Samsung IMMRs move shows both its willingness not to let any player infringe on its technology but also direct attention to the criticism that may have been risen by some of its Android partners including Samsung why should we be the only parties paying for a technology that is now clearly part of our main competitors offering We believe that a renewal of the Samsung license is now more likely and that it might represent a shortterm catalyst for the stock While Samsung didnt succeed in getting a ban on the importation of select Apple products in the Korean company may now become a kind of sponsor of a similar effort by Immersion just by renewing its license with the company Immersions position as the leading source of haptic IP would certainly be strengthened by a renewed agreement with the largest smartphone and tablet OEM Given the costs most likely involved in the lawsuit its almost as if Samsungs revenues generated in one single year are invested against Apple Well be able to give you a lot more information around the cost and the timing in our February earnings call as we provide guidance and assumptions around spending levels If you look at prior litigation although each litigation is unique in its own right in the most recent action with Motorola and HTC I believe we spent something in excess of million That would be spread over a number of years Immersion hired a very well know legal team to Apple the one that won a M jury verdict for WARF against Apple The choice of the lawyers hired by Immersion to proceed against Apple is quite interesting and worth a note Heres a partial list taken from the companys patent infringement complaint in the US District Court emphasis added Irell Manella are the same legal team that won a M jury verdict for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation WARF against Apple On October a federal jury in the Western District of Wisconsin found that Apple Inc owes Irell Manella client the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation WARF million for patent infringement following a twoweek trial Irell also represented WARF in earlier litigation against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the same patent which resulted in a million settlement shortly before trial in In addition WARF filed another suit against Apple earlier in September alleging that new Apple products including the iPhone S also infringe the patent The WARF trial team includes Morgan Chu Gary Frischling Jason Sheasby Alan Heinrich Annita Zhong Christopher Abernathy Amy Proctor Jackson Trugman and Tony Rowles The home team includes Richard Birnholz Rebecca Carson Gavin Snyder and Grace Chen Morgan Chu also was Immersions lead attorney in their court case against Sony SNE that still remains the companys largest win against an infringer A word of caution is necessary the environment for monetizing patent rights is certainly different today and more difficult to what it was just a few years ago Experts warn that defenders fight longer and harder because statistically theyre more likely to win than they used to be Apple has certainly the capacity and financial strength to defend vigorously in court Nevertheless as the WARF outcome shows a strong patent portfolio may survive a court case and see the patent holder being recognized their rights even against the largest US company Immersion has a very good history when it comes to proving their IP in court and the time had come for a make or break outcome of its haptic IP in the mobility sector We expect a lot of volatility in the months to come caused by the start of the legal action the possibilityrumors of a settlement and the ups and downs that are to be expected from court action but also additional scrutiny from investors which may be attracted to the story by the impact caused by this lawsuit It is little doubt that this move will represent another key moment in the history of the company whose outcome may be binary However a settlement or a court win also could mean a completely different value attributed to IMMR as by Richard Mashaals comments we previously highlighted In total billion would roughly translate into per share as opposed to Immersions current stock value of While we do not have this target price in the short term we believe that a renewal of the Samsung license and the first positive news from the start of the court case against Apple may lead to a double from this level in the next few months I wrote this article myself
