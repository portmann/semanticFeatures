Holdings Seizing The Process Advantage ARM Holdings plc NASDAQARMH Seeking Alpha ARMs Q earnings report featured strong revenue and income growth Wealth creation within the ARM ecosystem is propelling innovation such as rapid development of the nm node ARMs wealth advantage combined with the cost advantage of ARM chips will win over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in personal computing the datacenter and IoT ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH continues to post robust revenue growth of yy to million in Q as ARM processor shipments reached an alltime high of billion But the most significant announcement Wednesday may not have been ARMs earnings release but an announcement by ARM foundry partner Samsung OTCSSNLF that it would begin production on its nm FinFET node later this year Samsung will have reached production well ahead of competing foundries such as TSMC NYSE TSM which is set to go into nm node production in the second half of and even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC which will start up its own nm node at about the same time While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>struggles to get back onto the traditional year cadence and wouldnt promise that it could as of its Q conference call ARM foundries are picking up the pace At TSMCs Q earnings call it indicated that it would enter production on nm in the first half of and probably Samsung will as well By the time that the ARM foundries begin production on nm the year cadence will have been superseded by a much faster year cadence Almost certainly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will claim that the nm nodes of Samsung and TSMC are not true nm nodes just as it did with the nm FinFET nodes with some justification <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has pointed out correctly that not all circuit elements in the chips from Samsung and TSMC were the same size as Intels This meant that they didnt achieve the same transistor density as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Traditionally each process node has been accompanied by a doubling of transistor density and it remains to be seen if the Samsung and TSMC nm nodes will truly double transistor density over the nm nodes Even if the transistor doubling isnt quite achieved in each node by the time the foundries reach nm in they will have achieved greater density than Intels nm node Why the rush when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has dropped back to something like a year cadence Partly its to catch up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but mostly its being driven by the intense competition within the ARM ecosystem Consumer electronics giants such as Samsung and Apple NASDAQ AAPL are driving innovation in their quest to build more and more functionality and capability into mobile devices The enormous wealth being generated within the ARM ecosystem has translated into an ability to deploy capital resources that dwarf Intels TSMC alone has about the same capex planned expenditure for billion as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Apple will spend about billion What were seeing with the process node acceleration is the wealth advantage of the ARM ecosystem being put to the most productive use possible Eliminating Intels process advantage clearly has been a target of ARM foundries for some time By the ARM ecosystem will have left <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>behind The division of labor of the ARM model also seems to be working very well Rather than an integrated semiconductor maker such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>basic research device design and manufacturing are roughly segmented between ARM fabless chip and device companies such as Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Samsung and Apple and foundries such as TSMC If theres an advantage to integrating the three segments for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>its not apparent from Intels cost competitiveness in mobile devices As I conclude in my article on Intels Q earnings there is no cost competitiveness for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in mobile devices This condition will persist as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to rely on x architecture As a key research engine driving innovation in the ARM ecosystem ARM is positioned more or less at the top of the food chain benefiting from the intense competition among its licensees As ARM made clear during its Q conference call whether the licensee is a fabless semiconductor company like Qualcomm or an integrated device maker such as Apple the situation is revenue neutral to ARM So the trend of device makers such as Apple designing their own ARMbased processors doesnt hurt ARM ARMs position has meant that its revenue growth has been very highly correlated with processor shipment growth which was up yy This quarter operating margin was down to from the previous year of as ARM embarked on a fairly ambitious yy increase in headcount which mostly went into RD Operating expenses grew yy to million at current exchange rate ARM is gearing up to take on growth opportunities in the data center and high performance computing networking and the Internet of Things The data center especially is a major target as ARM looks to beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in cost and energy efficiency The fruits of these labors are probably still years away Qualcomms work in server development combined with increasing software stack maturity bode well for the longterm prospects of ARM in the data center The cost advantage that ARM has enjoyed in mobile devices will translate into cost advantage for ARM vendors such as Qualcomm in the data center as well Clearly ARM has some work ahead of it to design much higher performance CPU cores that are better suited for server applications When asked by an analyst during the conference call ARM would reveal nothing about future product designs but probably ARM will go in the direction of Apple and Qualcomm whose custom designed CPUs offer considerably higher performance than the current best ARM design the CortexA Well probably see a new Cortex design announcement some time this Fall Investors continue to be pretty lukewarm about ARM with the stock down about year to date I think theres still broad sympathy and support for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the US and the belief that somehow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will turn its mobile fortunes around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is believed to be impregnable in the data center as well As I describe in my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be on the verge of an historic shift in which it begins to embrace ARM architecture Even if it does that it will take years for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to fully come up to speed and its questionable whether it will ever be competitive with Qualcomm or Apple in ARM processor design Regardless of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>decides to do ARM ultimately wins ARM processor technology will continue to expand beyond its mobile base into personal computing cloud computing and IoT This is all being driven by wealth creation within the ARM ecosystem and is unstoppable at this point The fact that the market hasnt realized how severely disadvantaged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is becoming probably represents an opportunity for investors with a longterm year horizon Therefore I rate the stock as a cautious buy This caution is due to the fact that its not clear that the stock has bottomed and I wouldnt want to try to call a bottom That would be more market psychoanalysis than technology analysis Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
