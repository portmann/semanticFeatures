class='textDiv'>According To <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>PCs Arent Dead Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Theres no question that PCs have struggled over the past couple years However shipments are setting up for a recovery due to a largeold installed base new technologies and better product segmentation Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is better positioned to capitalize on this cycle due to crosssell opportunities of other components storage network connectivity Iris Pro Real Sense As such I feel fairly confident that CCG will grow as theres some upside to Intels outlook for the segment For the most part Im starting to get more optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC due to recovery in PC demand blistering growth in the DCG segment and fab margin improvements All of these pistons are starting to operate more properly and as such I see pretty solid upside to the stock as a result of a combination of all these factors However the segment that has been a sore spot for investors has been the CCG For the most part mobile is a major contributor to operating profitability in the CCG segment next year which is why theyre able to forecast lowteen operating margin growth for the consolidated segment This was driven by a million reduction to mobile costs much of which is pertaining to the fab RD component As such I feel fairly confident that CCG will have a solid year in terms of profitability and sales next year We also have enough visibility to anticipate stabilization in PC demand which is what Kirk Skaugen Senior Vice President and General Manager of Client Computing Group went into great detail explaining at this years investor day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mentioned that the PC installed base has expanded quite significantly over the past couple years The market seems positioned for a rebound and quite frankly I could see the CCG posting some shipment growth next year as there should be consumer refresh demand beyond just the XP refresh we saw in enterprise computers during The cyclicality of this business makes it hard to predict However a stable growth trajectory in CCG should begin to form over the next couple years Furthermore supply chain sources also indicate a pattern of shipments bottoming out whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>uses a conservative guide of low singledigit PC shipment declines The number of PCs older by three years or more was billion in according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and even more interesting is that the amount of demand for in notebooks has been relatively astonishing This part of the market is particularly attractive to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>because the ASPs in the segment are strong and it cannibalizes a segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>never had a meaningful presence in the tablet So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to grow in PCs they mitigate demand for midtier clamshell laptops but through segmentation they generate higher ASPs ins grew by over the course of but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>anticipates the in segments growth rate to accelerate by or more over the course of This will be done off a higher revenue base plus higher ASPs which implies meaningful impact on both shipments and sales for notebooks The incremental impact from in PCs was also able to offset a reduction in demand for conventional notebooks in It seems consumers are either opting for tablets or ins The ability to hold onto a handheld computer is a factor to marketability and for the first time in a while it seems consumers are entering the market to upgrade as opposed to buying a PC to replace a broken PC Ive had to replace two of my nonfunctional laptops in with a MacBook Air so I understand the broad consensus in sentiment among consumers wanting to wait until it breaks as opposed to upgrading The various efforts with technology has resulted in unexpected demand for mid to highend laptops Understandably the better security features due to real sense power efficiency in a better form factor and performance at the highend is driving demand for laptops that are optimized for gaming and work Combining these features has created new categories in the highend of the segment and various efforts to develop technologies to reduce the number of connectors will create a better experience for consumers Part of the reason why PC sales have dried over the past couple years was the lack of innovation in the segment but it seems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has taken over the reigns so theres more consistency in developing better platformspecific technologies so consumers are quicker to refresh PCs Furthermore due to the high demand for ins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the ability to ramp G modems into the Windows tablet and in PC ecosystem This has favorable implication on Intels ability to leverage mobile IP as theyre working out ways to improve WiFi and offer wireless connectivity for monitors WiGig The wireless connectivity to external monitors creates added incremental revenue for embedded chipsets in laptops which creates a better value proposition for enthusiasts hoping to connect two additional monitors to laptops without using HDMI cables Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be marketing an Optane line of SSDs using their recently unveiled D XPoint technology and will also remove power cords by replacing them with thunderbolt ports Given the technological improvements cross sale opportunities and various efforts to move pricing higher I think theres a fairly solid chance that the CCG becomes a bigger contributor to revenue growth going forward While the stock didnt react much following the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investor day I view the additional insights as offering enough visibility so investors can rally around the strengthening fundamentals While others have mentioned that the PC market could worsen I view the PC market as a strategic asset that allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to fund development in new product categories allowing them to sustain revenue growth Given all of these favorable dynamics I continue to reiterate my price target and high conviction buy recommendation We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
