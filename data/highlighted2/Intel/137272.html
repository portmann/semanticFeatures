July th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU held a joint webcast to announce a new memory technology called D X point memory Representing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was senior Vice President Rob Crooke with Micron represented by CEO Mark Durcan The conference was arranged in only a day and to me it looked like Rob was having the time of his life while it appeared that Mark wished he wasnt there Technical details were short on the new memory but it is said to be times or more Crooke denser than DRAM but not as dense as current NAND times faster than NAND but not as fast as current DRAM with times the endurance of NAND but not YET infinite endurance The new memory is also scalable Dont forget that it is very important The first part out of the chute is Gb Two shrinks and D X point begins to crowd even D NAND More interesting to me was that the new memory whether it is made out of star dust or peanut butter is Random Access Byte addressable like DRAM and NonVolatile like NAND So where does this new technology get positioned The simple answer is that it would be sandwiched between DRAM and NAND in the memory hierarchy The idea here is that the D X point would displace some MOST of the DRAM yet put more Random Access Memory in the system before moving to NAND storage OK so far we get some incremental performance with some dollar saving that ummm comes out of the DRAM budget Beginning to see why I think Mr Durcan didnt want to be at this meeting It is noteworthy that when Rob referred to the density of this memory he compared it to conventional memory of course conventional memory is DRAM Rob you old wordsmith you I was struck by the emphasis in the presentation on close proximity of computing and memory Anyone who has read my articles for any length of time will know that memorycompute proximity is one of my hot buttons as well It would be useful to discuss Intels EMIB Embedded MultiDie Interconnect Bridge with this new memory EMIB is a packaging technology that provides most of the benefits of D IC technology without the complexity and cost problems associated with TSV Through Silicon Vias technology Soooo since the new memory has high but finite endurance it probably couldnt be used for the very first tier of system memory For that one might use a monolithic Gb DRAM or even the Gb MB level DRAM cache chip that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>currently uses in their high end CPU chips Right behind that a single GB D X point chip would be appropriate So we have the CPU about sq mm average in nm no the real nm that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes and about sq mm for the GB of DRAM and about sq mm for the GB of D X point For processor and system memory we have a total of about sq mm of silicon That is well within the size range to be included in a single CPU package using EMIB technology Lets think about cost and end price of this module <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will get an average selling price across all client SKUs of about The GB of DRAM might cost and sell as a separate component for about The Gb XPoint chip will cost about and sell as an individual chip for about In order to develop a price for the EMIB module containing processor and GB of system memory you might compare it to GB of DRAM That would be about So you can take it to the bank that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will charge more for the processor with very high performance very low power GB of system memory in the package It will come down to if you want a client PC you will have to take the system memory with it in a single package at a single price that will actually look fair given the power saving and compute performance and compared to any alternative way of providing those functions The same approach in a mobile compute module that provides hours more battery time should be the compelling product that Otellini used to talk about I havent figured out how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sells the mobile version for the price that would be required for mass adoption in the highest tier smart phones Maybe the mobile part backs down to MB DRAM and GB of X point and NAND is still used for mass storage at per increment like Apple NASDAQ AAPL charges One way or the other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will creativedestruct memory into the processor package where it ceases to be a price sensitive commodity and becomes part of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>proprietary product The last time I wrote something like memory in package it wasnt possible sizewise and I was reminded of that often Not only is it now possible but it is scalable to boot Everything points to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>being the big winner here and I have chosen to play <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>over Micron The adjacent businesses are client and data center businesses and mobile could become a large profitable business This wont hurt the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SSD business either I think that Micron actually loses on this deal since they dont have an adjacent business to tie the X point memory to X point will eat into DRAM with every design win There is X point version and new memory B version one in the pipeline but Micron cant stand much more of this kind of innovation Source <span
