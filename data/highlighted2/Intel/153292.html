mouth about some of the developments they have done in their IMFT joint venture with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is extremely bullish on what the new DXpoint technology is going to mean Micron is bullish but hasnt given much background as to how they will market the technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron appear to be free to sell DXpoint as they choose with no marketing restrictions on each other in their joint venture My previous article IntelMicron D NAND And SSDs About To Explode was a week prior to the release of DXpoint Let me augment that title by now saying Non Volatile Memory is Exploding again in the very best sense of the word explode Notice the broadening to NVM and the change to the present tense Much of the change is due to what weve learned at the D Xpoint hasty unveiling and what Ive learned attending the Micron Technology NASDAQ MU Analyst Day and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Developers Forum slides for the presentations available at this link Tongue tied Micron For reasons nobody has been able to explain Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gave only hours notice for their poorly executed unveiling of the biggest thing to hit computer memories in years There were no potential customers of DXpoint on stage to validate the new memory concept no whitepapers and few specs Micron CEO Mark Durcan looked particularly uneasy next to his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>counterpart Rob Crooke I attended the August Micron analyst day and assumed incorrectly that shareholders would be given a lot more detail on DXpoint which had been developed over years and which will be built in the IntelMicron joint venture IMFT which owns a fab in Lehi Utah A happy and very effusive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The contrast with Microns analyst day and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Developers Forum which began today August couldnt be more striking when it comes to transparency on this amazing new product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich closed his keynote address with a side by side comparison of a state of the art <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NAND based Solid State Drive against a DXPoint SSD The latter delivered x the performance of the former we learned later in the day from Intels Rob Crooke Senior VP of the NonVolatile Memory Solutions Group that this performance increment would have been even larger but for the memory buss the DXpoint was using Two IDF sessions later on Tuesday August made my whole trip better They can be found at the link for IDF presentations by searching for these titles SSDs are here The Next Wave in Non Volatile Memory Driven Storage Modernizations and Technology Insight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NonVolatile Memory Inside The Speed of Possibility Outside So What did the two partners tell us Micron put up the following graph on one of its slides showing the growth of NAND demand That four year slice of time works out to about a compound annual growth rate By contrast in the first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SSD presentation cited above Greg Matson the Director of Strategic Planning for the NonVolatile Memory Solutions Group put up a more bullish slide And that five year time slice works out to a CAGR So whats between friends An enormous amount since by the terminal year we are dealing with billions of dollars of product even though the pricing of DXpoint hasnt yet been released Intels Matson said he believes DXpoint can scale to TB in a drive enclosure For comparison Samsung has just announced a NAND based SSD which will only scale to TB In the words of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>presenter Matson is the year of crossover from HDD to SSD The hard disc guys will never catch up Intels Matson shared the stage with Ruiping Sun Principal Architect of Yahoo who gave a real world example of where DXpoint would fit in his companys deployment and stratification of hot and cold storage Matson then displayed a nice series of slides on performance advantages which I hadnt seen elsewhere First he had this interesting comparison between hard discs and SSDs What the chart is showing is that HDDs degrade in performance as they get loaded down And then there was this slide which clearly shows where the DXpont released under the Optane system branding name fits Obviously Matson was quite pleased with the volume of the graph enabled by his light blue baby For the first time we have been given the why for the adoption by some customer segments Please download the entire slide decks from both presentations cited above They are good reading What about the different markets for the two partners in IMFT Unfortunately at both meetings the audience wasted a lot of time on hyper technical and competitive questions which were not going to get answered What is your error correction What are the materials How many metal layers are there I was able to ask a question of Rob Crooke after his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>presentation Are there any limitations on either partner in IMFT on how they can sell or who they can sell to He responded that DXpoint would primarily leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bundled into systems just as NAND does now You dont see us selling a lot or raw NAND chips and I dont think you will with DXpoint either He said wed have to ask Micron about their go to market strategy I took his answer to mean either company is unrestricted on sales Conclusions This new product is obviously going to be huge Microns Mark Durcan was uncharacteristically fairly specific and very bullish as to the size of the market In the timeframe DXpoint could easily be of the same order of magnitude as our DRAM businesses in that timeframe So maybe not the same size maybe half the size in but it will be a significant additive revenue stream to Micron at the time And clearly both companies are lavishing capital on Lehi Utah which has already seen a lot of construction Intels Crooke indicated that a wafer of DXpoint contains about TeraBytes or about individual Gb GB die At a price per GB chip which we only know lies between DRAM and NAND but which has been guessed to be between and Lehi Utah may soon be generating a total of almost billion in revenue for its two partners Micron is secretive tight lipped and not as bullish as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is quickly reeling out more data and has made this a show piece of their IDF It looks very big
