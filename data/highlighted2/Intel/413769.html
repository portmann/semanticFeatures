Day of the conference today So welcome everybody And our first keynote speaker for this morning is Lowell McAdam Chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications So today Verizon has a market cap in excess of billion revenue of billion plus a people and it operates primarily in the broadband and mobile space Lowell became CEO in August of Chairman in January and prior to that was Verizons President and COO If you read his bio which is printed in the materials that we have for everyone it says that Lowell has been one of the architects of todays global wireless industry having built Wireless businesses on three continents since the technology was first available in the s And this is true He was President and CEO of Verizon Wireless from to and before that was Executive Vice President and COO of Verizon Wireless and before that he ran the original AirTouch business So Lowell is regarded is a great operator but he is also a great technologist with a very clear vision of way a technology especially mobile technology is going And he has spearheaded Verizons push into new growth markets in IoT and in mobile entertainment So thank you for coming Lowell Nice to see you My name is Phil Cusick I cover the telecom and cable space at JP Morgan Thank you again for coming I was thinking this morning about our conversation recently In the gym I was thinking this morning about our conversation last night and since were in Boston and you just announced FiOS expansion here I was thinking about the different layers of connectivity whether its fiber or wireless or G Can you just talk about your overall sort of connectivity strategy and how they all flow together in particularly around the Boston effort Yes Thanks Phil and Jennifer thank you for that introduction Good morning everyone Appreciate your interest in Verizon and I hope youre enjoying the rainy Boston day So we talk a lot Phil about our threetier strategy and Ill focus on the bottom layer for us which is the connectivity layer For those of you that arent familiar with that the layers above that are what we call the platforms that we want to be very strong contributors and then the applications or as the solutions that ride on those platforms where we want to be a player but not necessarily dominant The connectivity layer is where we feel we need to be dominant As I look across my career you cant be good at the upper stack things if you arent the best at the connectivity layer And I think weve shown with our FiOS platform and with our wireless platform and we have a campaign ad campaign running now Better Matters to customers whether you look at your ability to have pricing power whether you look at your loyalty numbers which are very strong for us and have always been very strong Being that leading edge of technology opens up a lot of doors and helps to take care of customers so thats why we feel as strongly as we do Now Boston is a good example but Ill take you back onestep prior to Boston and that is what we did at the Super Bowl this year in San Francisco We went out and drove fiber very what we call deep into the network to get the fiber nodes close to the customer and then we deployed small cell technology to deliver very high speed so any of you that were at the Super Bowl if you were down on market street when they were doing the concerts in the evening Verizon was consistently delivering megabits of throughput and you saw lots of people streaming videos of the concert other carriers were running sub some of them their networks were completely blocked and you heard the usual buzz about the Verizon phone was the one that worked So that informed our decision around Boston and I have to since were in town here I have to compliment Mayor Walsh and his Chief of Staff Dan Koh because the past administration here wanted the sort of buildout that we have done in other areas You build everywhere then you go in and you try to get penetration They were more willing to help us get right away help us push fiber out into the neighborhoods do more presubscription all of the Google model and so what that does for us that gives us the ability to densify our network For G it gives us the ability to deal with enterprise customers that may want a fiber into their home or into their business or a small business that might want fiber into their business and it sets us up for G which Im sure well talk about where that gives us the ability to do the last whatever well call it the last mile is probably not a mile but the last distance into a home and provide either broadband over the top video or streaming video over one architecture Now just to give you the threetier come back to the threetier just for a second In the city of Boston we are already working with the city on how you do smart transportation how you control the electric grid if somebody wants a parking spot directing them there with map technology its all of the smart city things that we probably been talking about for a decade So I think a combination of some new spectrum available fiber being able to handle the capacity small cell technology is coming together to create a richness and a robustness of the network that Ive never seen in my career Well on a couple of levels first we talked about this publicly you will be able to see very high speeds on over wireless So the San Francisco example typical network today delivers maybe megabits and we were able to deliver just by getting very close to the customer managing spectrum differently If you look at G in a fixed wireless environment weve demonstrated for some of our shareholders in our Basking Ridge facility putting gigs into the house without a wire And if you think about that from a customers perspective if I can do that then the virtual reality all the other things D video conferencing the whole nine yards We all grew up watching in Star Wars actually might happen So I think thats what the consumer is going to see The key for us and I think the rest of the industry is making that a user experience and customers really enjoy so whether they are on WiFi whether they are on LTEUnlicensed whether they are G or G or G or whether they want to move back and forth between the fiber in their home or business in the wireless device thats where the magic is going to occur and youre seeing a lot of companies working on that today So I think its doable So you talked about G and getting fiber close to the customer How does that lead into my ability to use it my ability to run video either to a handset or to a fixed location Yes well I mean so in the example of our Basking Ridge campus we had I think six K TVs running we had three virtual reality boxes we had a bunch of tablets running and you could move the service back and forth pretty easily between any of those devices So I think for a customer they dont have to think about it and I think thats the key One thing weve always tried to do is not have the customer think about their technology and I think this connectivity layer thats being created right now will take that completely out of their mind Theyll all be focused on the experience and the content that they wont have And what about on the business side as you get fiber closer to the customer and consumers did you start to drive fiber further into businesses as well Yes No question I mean I think the problem that the telcos have had is a DSL service is really not going to keep up with DOCSIS and so weve had to do fiber and fiber is expensive for all of us So if you think about it if I can get we than say a meters of a business and I give them a router a basic router that has a G service inside it and Im up and operating immediately I mean think about the difference for the carrier in the cost structure half of our cost to establish high speed data whether its consumer business is inside the four walls of the business Once you go wireless you dont have to run coax you dont have to do any of those high labor intensive activities and so you light up service overnight So then you get into how much capacity do you want and you can the pricing models can change dramatically So video you support on the fireside youre getting into it on wireless side How important is video either as a paid service or as a free service for Verizon and how does that affect your Company over time Yes So I mean there is no secret video has been a major strategic move for us Obviously the FiOS has been delivering TV and broadband by the way broadband now as weve expected is starting to outsell TV by a significant margin Weve introduced this year our custom TV bundles or the skinny bundles those are have been consistently above of our sales so customers clearly want that The far and away the largest driver of traffic on a mobile network is video at this point and were seeing it grow and the big data streams growing yearoveryear I saw a study just out this week that said that video has doubled yearoveryear across the broader telecom networks thats very consistent with what we see So our strategic move I mean Ivan did the FiOS move but what weve done now through our go product was buy some IPTV platforms from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>OnCue weve turned that into a go product So weve got a very strong platform in place And now youve seen a start to buy some specific content so we had the NFL this is our first end of the first season of our NBA franchise doing a lot with the NBA to bring that content to the mobile device And weve now done some things with Hearst Corporation with DreamWorks and AwesomenessTV to bring things that are more targeted toward millennials who are using the phone as their major the phone and the tablet is their major source for watching video So weve again back to the threetier weve built the network to deliver it weve now got platforms in place to deliver and were doing some content to help fuel that whole video engine How do you drive scale in that content You need to buy it Can you work with partners All of the above The one thing that I try to think about is core competency and you know I put our team up against anybody in the world on the network side As you go up into platforms and things like content thats not exactly our strong suit So finding companies like Hearst has been great for us DreamWorks with Jeffrey Katzenberg you know were partnering with some of the networks CBS as an example in a big way So I think you know we want to crawl walk and then run and so I dont those of you I know your question is are we going to go buy a big network company Were not doing that I dont think we need to do that Its similar Phil in my view to physical distribution We have somewhere in the neighborhood of outlets for our service We have of those that we own So by owning those making those a cornerstone you can really influence the broader distribution market and we do those through partners then I think content is a very similar strategy for us I think go when were here two years ago we started to get buzz and it feels like the buzz got a little bit too far How do you think about go in terms of success from what you expected over the last couple of years I think we had always internally Phil viewed go as what we call patient money inside the business that we knew because it wasnt our core competency we knew were going to have to build slowly in this area and the way I would characterize that we have seen enough success to make us excited about continuing to work it but we didnt believe and I think it did get a little bit overhyped and Im sure we contributed to that to a certain extent But we didnt believe that it was going to move the needle on a billion revenue stream overnight As one of those things you have to work into and were on pace when we first rolled it we didnt think were going to do AOL at least that wasnt on the radar Now weve done AOL and we started to see the synergies between a go and the video content and frankly our other platforms and what we can do with AOL So we build on that and I think as we get more comfortable with AwesomenessTV and some of the other things that were doing well build on that So bottom line is gos in a good spot from our perspective were going to continue to pursue it but our expectations are realistic Stick a little bit more into AOL have been posting record numbers whats been driving the success there and how big can that get over time for the company Well the theory of the case for us was that if you believe that mobile is going to be the viewing choice for the millennials as they go through the Internet and video then having again those platforms that would help drive traffic on the network were critical Tim and I first started talking about this as a commercial relationship and as we started to see how you could use his assets and our assets yes we use to say two plus two should at least equal six We started to say this really belongs more inside the family And if you look at their performance I think we had a very good fourth quarter and it was up million over third quarter for them and then first quarter was their best quarter in five years so thats kind of working So this is one of those things you start to build scale around the content piece and around the eyeballs and the platforms So we are doing that organically now First quarter we bought Millennial Media that adds a little bit more to the ad tech stack for Tim And we cant talk about Yahoo but thats a possibility to gain greater scale There is also lots of other options for to gain greater scale So I think for both of these video and the Internet properties lets feed them at the right pace you can feed them too fast and you can feed them too slow so were going to try to find the right pace and I think it can be pretty big Now Tim has put some pretty wild numbers out there and I love those audacious goals as they say and we are going to support him to get there but how big it is I think it can be meaningful even to a billion revenue business So that was where I was going to go next And youve got million postpaid wireless customers Go is nice takes a while to have an impact IoT you mentioned at what point do all these things come together and actually start to have a material impact on the business and start to drive the revenue growth of the company faster Well its going to be a little difficult as to point to a specific time when quote its meaningful I think its one of those things that its just going to continue to grow and continue to grow We have arguments inside the business does IoT and go contributed to our churn improvements yearoveryear Does IoT and go get people to buy up in higher data bundles even if they do have our FreeBee Data service So look weve been talking about IoT I think we talked about this a little bit at dinner last night back in the late s when I started to get involved in cellular we used to talk about IoT being a huge revenue driver I finally think were on the cusp of that but on the meantime the industry is exploded So meaningful I think two three years out from now well be able to point to a significant revenue stream But Id also tell you its not bad to sit here right now and say we paid billion for AOL a yearago and now they had the best year in five years Thats good progress So we had a couple of your competitors here yesterday well have another one this afternoon and the theme as has been for a long time is this is the year were really going to go after Verizon And partly I think it comes from the industry is in a slow it seems like an a slow period where were waiting for these other revenue streams to start to come on and postpaid has been fairly stagnant Do you feel like that were in an air pocket for the industry overall and that theres more growth overall in wireless coming or do you think this is sort of the natural pace of industry growth where we are today Well as Jennifer said Ive been around the industry a long time And I was listening to John Malone being honored the other night and he said as you get older eventually you start to see things twice which means I got to be really old now because Im seeing this stuff three and four and five times But I go back to the original ATT estimate for wireless was million customers nationwide by I think it was right And in I literally had people say to me why you are going to go join Verizon Everybody knows weve tapped out Were not going to youre not going to grow mobile anymore and it happened again at G and G and G So I just go back to the recent memory and say if you remember and I remember a conversation I had with Steve Jobs when I was describing what G LTE would do and I said we might be able to get as high as megabits okay stop you got me Im going to invest Im going to build the iPhone and what are the iPhone do I mean that the technology open the door to the innovation which has spurred growth As we said last night at dinner I think the leap from G to G was a bit more of a leap of faith than the leap from G to G If you look at the pentup demand around IoT at around video and around virtual reality and I dont disagree with Mark Zuckerberg that virtual reality maybe five years or years out before it becomes big but think about if it becomes big what does that mean for industrial use for enterprise use for entertainment use And when you can deliver this early in the process when you can deliver two gigs into a home with beamforming antennas so there is another big surge coming There is no doubt in my mind and the competitors look those of you that have been around since every one of those competitors has been two years away from catching Verizon If we stood still yes it might happen Guess what we dont stand still So were going to lead on G and we will probably lead on G whatever that comes but in the meantime theres a lot of opportunity out there Okay And are you confident that Company can continue to grow on the subscriber base as all that sort of waiting happens as we wait for these next generation technologies Yes Well I dont think we have to wait a long time I mean theres a distinction between G in a fixed wireless environment versus a mobile environment and those that are working on standard say mobile is more or like a phenomenon Okay I wouldnt argue with that The use case for me that gets you over the hump on investing in the technology is the one thats right in front of us right now and thats a fixed wireless play and doing what weve what I outlined that were going to do in Boston That gives you all the return on capital that you need to invest in that technology and the rest of its going to be gravy So I feel very good about where we are Dig into that a little more I mean you mentioned G in Boston do you think of G for fixed wireless more as a in region broadband replacement sort of a complement to FiOS traditional or is it something that could go nationwide You really you just need to get access to fiber close and close is to be defined and thats why we bought XO Communications here in the last quarter because they have of the top markets they have metro fiber rings that gives you the ability to be out into those markets and then you just run your extensions off of them but Phil even if I look at world markets the Company that has the best world coverage of any carrier in the US is rising So weve got whatever it is like towers out there so if you start using the towers as the hub and you just spoke fiber off of that to get into the towns across the US youve got the ability and those customers are incredibly hungry for broadband So limiting ourselves within the FiOS footprint the Washington to Boston corridor which by the way I love and we will invest in that just like we are here in Boston but theres no reason you need to be limited to Boston to Washington Okay Whether youre coming from the wireless side or coming from the fixed side it seems like mobility and fixed are coming together pretty fast and weve been hearing about cable getting into wireless or wireless getting into fixed for a longtime it seems like its coming together more quickly than it has before It seems silly right now that it seems unlikely the two or three years from now were going to be sitting here thinking about four wireless players and independent broadband providers How do you see these industries coming together Well I mean they sound a little bit like a cop out but it will come together as quickly as the regulators allowed to I dont for Verizon where they were competing against three wireless three other carriers or two other carriers were going to play our game Im going to do G in one Im not going to do it another Im going to go do it So I think the health of the industry and how much capital each carrier has to invest is going to be governed by the structure of the industry And theres been a couple of runs added and theyve been shot down I heard one of our competitors yesterday was lobbying for a purchase and if that happens I think that opens up lots of other possibilities So I think bottom line is it just comes down to what the regulators are going to agree to Yes Speaking of that I was at the Cable Show last week and that industry is very vocally saying that they feel like theyre under attack The FCC is very activist against them How do you see this regulatory environment and what are the risks for Verizon Well I guess I would just say to those that were complaining welcome to the pool Weve been swimming in this pool for a long long time and look our view is when you over regulate an industry theres so many unintended consequences that its usually worse than better but if youre going to regulate then our view is you got to have a level playing field And right now whether its a Google or a Comcast or whoever if youre providing broadband services you should be playing by the same rules that all the rest of us have to play by So thats our philosophy So I think the special access is one that youre probably referring to Wed rather not have it but I dont think thats the kind of regulation that should only be ATT and Verizon and CenturyLink and Frontier and the traditional telcos If youre a broadband provider then you need to be over those you need to be governed by those rules So lets follow that down into more your business and enterprise side Where do you see the overall environment for small and medium business business creation and what are your enterprise customers telling you I think lets start with the enterprise side I think theres a stability that we probably havent seen over the last three four years but I dont see people investing in a big way I go to the BRT I get to talk to a lot of the largest CEOs and I think right now everybody is still waiting and frankly perplexed by the political environment here And who ends up being the President and what their philosophy is doesnt matter whether youre Republican or Democrat I think most people are scratching their heads here until that becomes clear I think enterprises are going to hold back a little bit We do talk a lot about the tax environment and wed love to see some rationale rationalizing of the tax codes but all that will lead into regulation On the small business side theres certainly lots of activity there Thats part of the reason were bullish on getting fiber more into places like Boston because we think theres lots of opportunity there there is lots of businesses that are being established and we think there is good opportunity Okay Youve been in dispute now with your union for about six weeks now can you give us an update there and talk about any impact on the business overall Yes So we have been out on strike now for days Those of you that were probably greeted on the way in this morning by a few cheers or encouraging us we are under a bit of a gag order now so I cant say a lot about negotiations I just will say that the Secretary of Labor Tom Perez has been very helpful in the process so we do appreciate that The impact of the strike is probably what people are most interested in here Our goals are to get our costs a bit more in line we are obviously more expensive from a wage and benefit than our competitors are but we also realize we cant change this overnight for our employees is not fair to them so were trying to get that a bit more in line We need to have a lot more flexibility if youre coming in and building up a force to build Boston you need to have the ability to move that force around so of course flexibility is the other major issue for us As far as impact to the Companys bottom line the way I think about it is the first three months of the strike youre doing a lot of training of new people to temporary workers to do the work and so your costs are up from a pure cash perspective because youre not paying the wages and youre somewhat offsets so cash is relatively neutral The second three months of the strike is where your productivity goes up and were actually well ahead of that Our managers are doing a super job out there theyre covering the installation and repair load all of our call center activities are frankly running as well are better than they do normally We have pushed off installations or doing a lot of installations but were not doing the same volume that we have before So we wont be driving similar numbers in second quarter that we would in first from an installation perspective So the overall impact just depends on how we come out of the contract because we will get some concessions and then how long it goes So when its done we will make sure to communicate with our investors about what the overall netnet impacts are Sure Last sort of big topic and help me think about the potential once were through this installment plan shift which has been dragging and moving revenue around how do you think about the potential for the aggregate business to grow revenue and earnings over time Yes Well I think first of all we had said mid that was going to be a year of transition for us So we sold the three properties to Frontier They were very profitable but they were not scalable for us so it was the right thing to do So that has an impact on earnings and theres some overhead associated that we need to get out of the business and were working on that So that was a bit of a drag The move to the installment plans our philosophy has always been let customers choose what they want Netnet while it may look better for earnings in the short run the longterm value of the customer is about the same So we have not pushed that as hard as others and as Fran said last week our adoption rate of device installment has been in the high s whereas others have been in the more in the mids and you know each percentage point is meaningful But thats what our customer base wants They want to maintain the subsidy and so Im not going to force them out of that That transition does lower your revenue per subscriber and then it flattens out over time and then it rises back up again Weve watched the other carriers and what their curve looks like and we think were in that the trough of that curve now and beginning to move back up So that will offset So weve taken a number of steps We did a reorganization took cost out We still continue to do our Verizon Lean Six Sigma approach We take typically billion a year out of the business from that perspective So all of those meant that to was going to be a plateau was the word I used and then in we would return to normal growth for our company and we think thats the case The strike by the way is a little bit of a wildcard in that as I indicated But we think that will put us back on that track Copyright policy All transcripts on this
