style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has led a financing round for an enterprise version of Open Stack cloud software The investment shows that Intels software interests remain proprietary This is a good dividend play at current prices just dont expect growth Most tech giants take what they have as a given and are looking for growth in cloud devices or both This is true for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC which has regularly failed to sell chips to device makers but has enjoyed success this decade as a commodity chip supplier to cloud data centers most of which standardize on its x architecture Its a nice business but a mature one and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>like any tech company worth considering always wants more At Wednesdays opening price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sports a fat yield of which looks nice against the year bond rate of That dividend has been stable for several years having gone to cents in and cents this year The company hands back less than half its earnings in dividends thanks to fat margins that reach for and sometimes exceed The dividend is secure One thing Ive written regularly here is that hardware has become software and that hardware companies are on the whole writing proprietary software into their chips and paying someone to make the design <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is unique in that it makes its own designs and I have been critical of that feeling it could be a more profitable fab if it were separated from manufacturing and a more responsive designer as well But Im not going to relitigate the point here Instead Im going to point to a million investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital recently made into Mirantis as an example of its continuing problems The deal is aimed at increasing adoption of Open Stack an open source cloud infrastructure among enterprises which is a good thing But its being made through a small company that Intels investment can control Jonathan Davidson of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>defends the investment in a blog post saying that enterprises find Open Stack too complex too distant from enterprise applications and think it takes too much time to set up By bringing big venture capital partners to Mirantis analysts say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes a strong move into the cloud It is in fact nothing of the sort because Open Stack is open source software <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could write these new features itself and contribute them if it wanted Open Stack to succeed What working with Mirantis can do for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is only fork Open Stack creating an enterprise version for sale which competes directly with versions written by Red Hat NYSE RHT HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ and others What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing here is not in Open Stacks best interest then but in Intels best interest It still after all these years doesnt view open source in which development costs are shared among all players with anything but suspicion If it cant exercise control directly or indirectly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt really want to play This need for control has been Intels problem for over a decade now ever since the Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Wintel monopoly showed signs of cracking As a software outfit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains proprietary Wintel at least showed an open side a shared responsibility Until Intels software operations become truly open it will remain what it is a nogrowth dividend payer rather than the growth company it sees itself as There are horses for courses and if you want to be a dividend investor you can buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>today with confidence Its a bargain at But its not going to break through its late highs until it does what growing companies do today which is work and play well with others A
