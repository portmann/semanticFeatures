been more responsive to dividends than that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomm may appeal more to incomeoriented investors in this regard However with Intels INTC growth far outpacing that of Qualcomm in the past year growthoriented investors are likely to find more favour in this stock The purpose of this article is to use regression analysis methodologies in investigating the effects of dividend growth on the overall returns of both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM At the outset this article is not necessarily seeking to examine which is the better investment however a greater understanding of how each companys stock price moves in line with dividend growth may be of use to investors in determining whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm may be better suited to a growthoriented or incomeoriented strategy Since both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm have shown consistent growth in dividend payments However we can see that on a cumulative basis Qualcomm has grown dividends by while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has grown dividends by over the same period Source nasdaqcomAuthors Calculations A growthoriented investor is understandably not as concerned about dividend growth as an incomeoriented investor In this regard a growthoriented investor may be inclined to choose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>if the company had a history of significantly outperforming on the basis of capital gains An incomeoriented investor on the other hand would prefer a stable stream of income over rapid growth and in this sense Qualcomm would be seen as more suitable However many investors lie between these two spectrums in reality and dividend growth invariably has a material effect on stock price In this regard I use an Ordinary Least Squares regression along with cointegration analysis to quantify the impact of dividend growth on stock price from present and also determine the significance of the relationship between the two From the above several insights become clear The OLS regression indicates that dividend growth has a much more material effect on Qualcomm than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>For instance for every in dividend growth Qualcomms stock price rises by whereas that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>rises by Moreover with an RSquared figure of for Qualcomm and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the impact of dividends on Qualcomms share price is indicated to be more significant Additionally the PhillipsOuliaris test for cointegration is significant at the level for Qualcomm whereas the test shows insignificant results for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>This implies that dividends and stock price follows a random walk for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ie the two variables are random and do not necessarily move in step However presence of cointegration in Qualcomms case implies that dividend growth and stock price has a more significant relationship ie the two are more likely to converge over time So what does this tell us in layman terms While this does not reveal whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or Qualcomm is the better investment per se it does indicate that investors looking for a blend of growth in both share price and income are more likely to find this with Qualcomm For instance if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were to announce a dividend raise and an investor bought the stock with the expectation that Intels share price would rise also there is a significant chance heshe would be disappointed However Qualcomm might likely appeal more to investors who are expecting capital gains at least partially derived from dividend growth In conclusion the analysis in this article would suggest that Qualcomm might be a better choice for investors seeking a longterm incomeoriented strategy across firms in the semiconductor industry In terms of growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been the clear winner lately appreciating by in the past year versus for Qualcomm Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>looks like a stock more suited towards high growth whereas Qualcomm represents more of a longterm income investment Source <span style='background-color:
