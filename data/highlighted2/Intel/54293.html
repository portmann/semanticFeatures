aggressive The guidance contradicts what Intels management team anticipates from PC Client in the second half of the current fiscal year The update to roadmap for both Zen and Zen was intriguing However the performance gains will not keep pace with Skylake in AMD NASDAQ AMD offered really ambitious financial targets for the second half of Its not exactly clear whether AMD will meet its own financial projections or whether the sellside will buy into the optimistic forecasts from Wednesdays analyst day presentation Despite the glittery graphics and the convincing tone in which management presents its bold vision Im bearish AMD has always over promised on its ability to improve its designs and processes What usually ends up happening is a series of bottlenecks that prevents AMD from releasing a key product on time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC pulls ahead and gains all the higherend designs from OEMs This has been the case for the past years I havent seen anything that could convince me that this trend will somehow change The company anticipates sales growth of yearoveryear in the back half of the year Im not completely sold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wasnt nearly as optimistic with its own fullyear guidance And quite frankly there are only two CPU providers in the marketplace anyway So we have to weigh the opinions of Intels management team with more than just a bit of salt For the most part I felt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was far more realistic on its revenue guidance despite having limited visibility into holiday season sales Heres what Stacy Smith CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mentioned earlier in the year Turning to the full year We expect revenue to be approximately flat to down from the prior guidance midsingledigit percentage growth Were now projecting a midsingledigit decline in the overall PC market We continue to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center Group Internet of Things Group and NAND businesses which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>anticipates that its growth will be flat yearoveryear and will offset the negative growth from client computing group with NAND data center and Internet of things Clearly AMD has limited exposure to mobile IoT NAND and data centers so I find AMDs reasoning of back half growth pretty erroneous In fact AMD is almost nonexistent in servers and its semicustom business is on the frontend of a downward cycle due to falling ASPs for its APUs in console gaming devices I anticipate console gaming devices to slow in growth as competing consumer electronics will tighten the available discretionary spending for premium gaming devices Also portable gaming devices are a rapidly shrinking market due to the rapid emergence and adoption of smartphone devices AMD wont find niche opportunities worth expanding into with its current portfolio of semicustom designs I cant imagine a scenario where AMD will generate enough volume from smaller markets to offset the decline in pricing and volume it has experienced in consumer CPUs and GPUs Also the company forecasts an increase in gross margins it plans to accomplish this with a mixshift to premium products in servers and workstation graphics However it has been shown that both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA have developed superior enterprise grade hardware solutions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>plans to launch another generation of Xeon series chips pretty soon And needless to say Nvidia has plans of improving its architecture to better utilize Direct X which is projected to improve frame rates per second by a considerable amount going into calendar year AMD plans to improve its platform efficiency which is likely to be driven by improvements in the instruction per cycle and improvement in manufacturing process It certainly helps that GlobalFoundries and Samsung OTC SSNLF are working in conjunction to deliver nm technologies The combined scale of a joint fab gives AMD a reasonable shot at reasonable yields assuming Global Foundries can meet the requirements of AMDs wafer supply agreement The improvement in performance from Zen to Zen might not be as significant as the performance gain from Excavator to Zen Much of the performance gains from improving CPU architecture already occurred between Zen and Excavator due to simultaneous multithreading which is similar to Intels hyper threading So its more likely that Zen based on the naming cadence is just a die shrink of the preexisting architecture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wasnt able to accomplish significant IPC gains from Haswell to Broadwell with a simple die shrink but was able to squeeze in some power efficiency gains due to duty cycling control Skylake will directly confront Zen on a more advanced node with superior architecture when working under the assumption of a second half launch Early reports on Intels upcoming lineup of CPUs are extremely promising AMD may hold onto some of the PC market with Zen and Zen AMD certainly is not dead and its update on the roadmap is pretty helpful for investors and speculators However I dont think the back half financial figures are going to be remotely accurate as were still months way from supply chain confirmation Overall Im still bearish on AMD The transition to Zen will not close the performance gap to Skylake Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks
