style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors should no longer expect an xpowered Lumia phone to come soon It looks like Microsoft will continue its exclusive deal with Qualcomm Snapdragons even for entrylevel Lumia phones Paul Thurrott predicted that entrylevel Windows devices from Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT would use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC x Atom processors this year PCWorld also discussed this alleged rekindling of the Wintel alliance for Windows phones They deemed the Atom x SoFIA chip ideal for Lumia Windows phones However it looks like Microsoft will stick to Snapdragons for its new flagship and entrylevel Windows Lumia smartphones A leaked Spanishlanguage presentation slide of the upcoming entrylevel Lumia says it has a GHz quadcore Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon processor Microsofts snub might be due to Intels decision to delay delivery of GLTEenabled versions of the Atom x to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>previously promised to deliver an LTEcapable Atom X SoC during this nd half of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will just have to make do by supplying its Atom x chips to Chinese whitebox phonephablets vendors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders therefore should not expect that Microsoft will use the Atom x this year or in the near future Nadella is streamlining the Lumia product portfolio to a more limited number of models The Lumia is likely to be Microsofts last entrylevel phone in It is mostly likely the only successor to the Lumia Google GOOG GOOGL and its partners previously used MediaTek chips for its firstgen batches of Android One smartphones It has shifted to using Snapdragon for its more expensive ndgeneration Android One handsets My suggestion now is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>being close to Google should try positioning the higherpriced Atom x processors for the more expensive versions of Android One smartphones If Microsoft continues its exclusive deal with Qualcomm then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has to get in bed with Googles ambitious grand master plan to saturate the world with affordable Android One smartphones Intels longterm mobile strategy is in vain if the only global OEM thats using x Atom chips for smartphones is ASUSTeK OTCASUUY Googles Android One project is a gateway for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to persuade more Android manufacturers to trust the Atom x Letting Google subsidize sub Android One handsets is also great because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wont have to offer discounts for its processors intended for Android One partner OEMs If Google distrusts Inteldesigned Atom processors for its pure Android One handsets then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can just tap its partner Rockchip to create a custom version of the Atom x The stock Android OS of Android One smartphones probably demands that an x chip should be compatible with Android apps and Google Mobile Services It is true that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is already delivering bit x Atom chips that match the power efficiency of ARMbased processors However it was known before that previous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mobile processors were incompatible with some Android apps Rockchips long years of designing chips for Android devices might help it find a way for Atom x chips to be fully compatible with all Android apps Not getting design wins from Microsoft Lumia devices is a painful reminder that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has a long way to go in the mobile chips business Aside from snubbing the Atom x in the Lumia Microsofts new flagship Lumia and Lumia XL Windows phones are also still using Snapdragons I believe Intels Cherry Trail Atom x is as good as the Snapdragon and Snapdragon I even think that the older Atom Z chip is already better for Windows than any ARMbased processors The Asus ZenFone Android phone with GB of RAM and Atom Z CPU could run the full version of the Windows desktop operating system It should also pretty easily run the pareddown lightweight Windows Mobile OS I will continue to remain long on INTC hoping that Microsoft and Acer will eventually realize that only an x processor is qualified to make Windows OS mobile phones get the Pocket PC badge I am also long QCOM but I doubt if that company would be able to create an ARMbased processor that could be compatible with all the legacy x software used by enterprise users Even without Microsofts support for x mobile chips INTC is a Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could dump its Atom x chips on to whitebox Chinese OEMs who make sub Android phones and cellular callingenabled tablets Editors Note This article
