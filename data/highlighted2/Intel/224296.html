Powertech Unisplendour and Unigroup are investing in companies that are competitors of each other The era of big investments from China in semiconductors is just beginning The trillion renminbi investment in the semiconductor industry over the next years is not hyperbole In July rumors of Tsinghua Unigroup making a billion bid for Micron NASDAQ MU surfaced Before this bid many Micron shareholders and Americans in general probably have never heard of Tsinghua Unigroup In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC purchased a stake in Tsinghua Unigroup an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Tsinghua Holdings is a limited liability corporation funded by Tsinghua University an elite research university located in Beijing To those who are not familiar with universities in Asia an accurate description of the prestige of Tsinghua in China is similar to that of MIT or CalTech in the US Tsinghua is close to universally regarded as the top school for engineering mathematics and the sciences in China I attended a graduate course in random signal analysis at a renowned American university that was filled with many graduates of Tsinghua Suffice it to say I was very impressed with the mathematical aptitude of this set of Chinese students Tsinghua Holdings has many operating subsidiaries Along with Tsinghua Unigroup the Tsinghua Tongfang Company and Unisplendour are the most wellknown operating subsidiaries of Tsinghua Holdings Unisplendour has made headlines in the US this year with its acquisition of a majority stake in HewlettPackards NYSE HPQ Chinese server storage and technology assets Unisplendour also agreed to buy a stake in HDD hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital NASDAQ WDC for billion Within weeks Western Digital announced a deal to acquire NAND flash manufacturer SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK for billion in mostly cash Tsinghua Holdings via its operating subsidiaries is quickly amassing a large portfolio of semiconductor and technology assets Tsinghua Unigroup acquired WSJ link requires subscription a stake in Powertech Technology for million in October Powertech is one of the leading chip packaging and testing companies in Taiwan The IC backend supplier PowerTech along with Micron announced in December that the two companies would form an over million joint venture to build a facility in Xian China to perform assembly and packaging services for Microns memory chips Micron should be able to realize some additional incremental gross margin by reducing the amount it spends on outsourcing backend services Through its Powertech stake Tsinghua Unigroup will indirectly benefit from the success of Micron and the DRAM industry in general <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>INTC has a strategic alliance with Tsinghua Unigroup as well as a ownership stake that it acquired for billion Tsinghua Unigroup announced its acquisition of Spreadtrum in and also unveiled its acquisition of RDA Microelectronics in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>hopes its alliance with Tsinghua Unigroup will allow the American semiconductor giant to jointly develop Intelbased chips for mobile phones both for the Chinese market and other markets with its Chinese ally Tsinghua Chairman Zhao Weiguo has called the development of a semiconductor industry in China a national priority <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has struggled to gain a foothold in the mobile SoC business and has been bleeding billions of dollars over the last few years in an attempt to create a viable mobile chip business Establishing a strong Chinese customer base could be the key to Intels mobile chip dreams and Intels decades of experience and top quality engineering talent could be instrumental to the development of Tsinghua and Chinas semiconductor endeavors Intels partnership with Micron has been fruitful over the last several years Through its joint venture the two American semiconductor companies are producing planar NAND flash currently The two partners have developed a high density D NAND product that will likely be the lowest cost NAND solution in the market in These two have also developed D XPoint a nonvolatile memory with incredible performance characteristics that has the potential to fundamentally change the memory hierarchy of electronic devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has stated that it will roll out D XPoint based SSDs SolidState Drives in I initially speculated that D XPoint would displace some DRAM demand as XPoints nonvolatile nature and likely lower cost make it a better choice than DRAM in many IMDB applications While there are a lot of unknowns about this next generation NVM it seems highly likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron are planning for D XPoint to become the eventual successor to D NAND It probably is a bit early to start anointing a successor to a technology that Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are still at least several months away from producing in high volumes Tsinghua Unigroup has a relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>through Intels stake and alliance with the rapidly growing Chinese semiconductor firm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron have operated a successful joint venture together for years Tsinghua Unigroup and Micron have a mutual ally in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Micron has a large joint venture with Powertech and Tsinghua Unigroup has now become a large shareholder of the Taiwanese backend services company Tsinghua Unigroup and Micron also have a mutual ally in Powertech Tsinghua Unigroup has hired Charles Kau Chairman of Inotera and President of Nanya Could the hiring of Kau signal Tsinghua Unigroups desire to pursue Micron or one of its smaller Taiwanese memory affiliates Nanya and Inotera Because of Microns large stake in Inotera and business arrangement it seems more likely that Tsinghua could target an acquisition of Nanya the second largest shareholder of Inotera behind Micron While Tsinghua Unigroup may desire an acquisition of Nanya it seems more likely that the Taiwanese memory manufacturer will find itself under Microns umbrella via an acquisition I think we all know that Tsinghua Unigroup has its eye on a much bigger prize Micron Tsinghua Unigroup has developed strong ties with companies that have joint ventures with Micron However Tsinghua Unigroups affiliated company Unisplendour which is also an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings has made investments in companies that are in competition with Tsinghua Unigroups investments Unisplendour has agreed to invest billion for a stake in Western Digital one of the two dominant HDD manufacturers left standing Western Digital then agreed to a deal to acquire SanDisk the biggest pure play NAND manufacturer around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with Micron has big plans in NAND and other nonvolatile memories that will be in direct competition with SanDisk On the Unisplendour side there is Western Digital SanDisk and HP SanDisk previously announced a deal with HP to develop a next generation NVM nonvolatile memory that will have similar performance characteristics to that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microns D XPoint On the Unigroup side there is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Powertech While I fully anticipate the UnisplendourWestern Digital and the Western DigitalSanDisk deals to eventually receive regulatory approval there certainly could be a hiccup or two in the process One of the major consequences of a UnisplendourWestern DigitalSanDisk deal is that the unlikely Tsinghua UnigroupMicron merger will become even less likely to receive regulatory approval On top of national security concerns and protests of famous Congressman antitrust concerns will enter the picture if Unigroup finally makes a formal bid for Micron Thats on top of the necessity of the Chinese company to more than double its informal bid of billion to give Micron shareholders a reason to hand over the reigns of the Idahobased memory giant that has weathered so many semiconductor cycles over the decades Intels relationship with Tsinghua Holdings has also gotten messy over the last several weeks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>owns of Tsinghua Unigroup and Unisplendour will be a large shareholder of Western DigitalSanDisk an adversary of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in nonvolatile memory In an article I posted on this site in September titled Micron and Chinas Semiconductor Dreams I discussed the possibility of Tsinghua Unigroup potentially acquiring Micron or forming a joint venture with Micron At the time I thought an acquisition of Micron had near zero probability While a joint venture or partnership of some sort is more likely than an acquisition I still thought a Tsinghua UnigroupMicron partnership as unlikely However theres been a lot of activity in the industry over the last or weeks It is abundantly clear that not only is China committed to investing up to a trillion renminbi billion in the semiconductor industry over the next years but it is willing to make big moves as soon as possible The acquisition of of Powertech by Tsinghua Unigroup could be a mere value investment and poaching Charles Kau from Inotera and Nanya could also just be acquiring one of the most successful and wellconnected men in the memory industry A Micron acquisition has almost no chance of receiving regulatory approval but a partnership or joint venture of some sort is possible I believe it is certainly a possibility that the recent moves by Unigroup are a precursor to Unigroup eventually partnering with Micron andor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to build memory chips DRAM andor NAND in China While the reasons I gave for believing a MicronTsinghua Unigroup joint venture as being unlikely in the original article linked above are still valid the probability of such a deal has moved up over the last or weeks What does this all mean for Micron I will discuss one possibility Micron will acquire Nanya and give itself twothirds ownership of Inotera in the process Micron may partner with Tsinghua Unigroup to build a DRAM fab or fabs in China Micron then converts many of its other DRAM fabs to D NAND and D XPoint fabs Tsinghua Unigroup not only acquires a stake in Powertech but also attempts to acquire stakes in other Taiwanese IC companies that could be of strategic importance to Micron After the conversion of DRAM fabs into nonvolatile memory fabs Micron investors will find out how much more profitable building a D NAND or D XPoint wafer is relative to a wafer of DRAM Estimates will vary tremendously right now but I strongly suspect the profitability of Micron per wafer will be multiples higher for D NAND and XPoint relative to DRAM While I am discussing the possibly way overly ultra bullish thesis I will throw out one other fun note about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Some Micron investors panicked and sold Micron shares upon news of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>converting one of its Chinese fabs into a fab dedicated to building D NAND This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fab story was a possibility that Kipp Bedard of Micron mentioned at a Raymond James conference in September Bedard stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may build D NAND and XPoint capacity on its own because demand for these products may be so high that Micron and Intels current joint production efforts along with Microns independent production efforts in Singapore are nowhere close to enough to fill the incredible number of orders that are predicted to come There are three possible reasons why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to be pushing the industry into what most analysts seem to think is a likely oversupply of NAND <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes Wall Street estimates are clueless and just way off The semiconductor giant may have internal estimates of NAND demand that is far greater than what the rest of the market sees right now This is a corollary to reason number <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes the SSD revolution is coming sooner than what most of the market believes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes SSDs is about to significantly eat into the market share that was previously held by HDDs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes that the joint development efforts with Micron that have led to D NAND and D XPoint and potentially other memories in the pipelines are going to be more revolutionary than the market currently believes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron may believe they have a D NAND and next generation NVM solution that is not just incrementally better than that of its competition The solutions are so good and will scale in a way that makes the D NAND and nextgeneration NVM solutions of its competitors no longer economically viable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with Micron is looking at the possibility of a huge market share grab and putting a competitor or two to sleep The possibility number would be great for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron longs but that one is extremely unlikely from my perspective Possibility number is more likely and possibility number is the most likely A Tsinghua UnigroupMicron merger is not going to happen but Unigroup could certainly end up being a strong ally for Micron going forward That possibility is starting to look more likely with every new deal Unigroup is making I remain long Micron and I strongly suspect I will remain long Micron through and and possibly far beyond We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
