Im Much More Optimistic On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is well positioned to grow in the second half due to seasonal factors and product refresh This implies that the PCCG could balance out to growth with other business units and integration of Altera into revenueearnings providing upside With these factors combined Im anticipating revenue growth of net income growth of and EPS growth of for FY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has had a pretty slow start to the year given the fact that PC volumes were anticipated to be weak when compared to prior years However I anticipate that these trends will likely improve going into the back half of fiscal year based on confirmation from management guidance which gives me enough comfort to raise my price target and reinitiate my buy recommendation Interestingly enough it seems that the highend of the PC market is still a very robust market as it contributes significantly to Intels annual revenue At least according to the Citi global technology conference the tower PC segment alone contributes billion in revenue which is approximately of Intels revenue This particular market segment is likely to improve given the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is expected to ramp up production for the Skylake series processors Of course expectations arent necessarily going to be that high but that doesnt change the fact that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to maintain flat revenue in the PC client group the data center group will sufficiently drive revenue growth in fiscal year which will significantly improve the share price going into back half of This would be a divergence in fiveyear growth trends as its been exceedingly difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to breakout of billion in annual revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes that its next highmargin category will be twoinone PCs which is basically a tablet and ultrabook combination This is mostly driven by the higher average selling price Volumes in this specific segment is improving at a pretty steady pace and thats another factor to why PCCG could go from negative to growth in the current fiscal year Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes that it can continue to innovate inside of the PC segment by eliminating wires passwords and integrating interaction via alternative inputs Going forward its highly likely that PCs will become more powerful and will be much more intuitive to use based on hand gestures touchbased interaction and virtual reality Going into the financial analysis part the assumptions on growth really change in the current fiscal year assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to integrate the Altera acquisition and is also able to generate yearoveryear comps for the PC client group On a consolidated basis sales could grow by yearoveryear which is partially driven by billion in incremental revenue from Altera combined with billion in revenue growth from the data center group The gross margin should slightly move higher as the growth segments have slightly higher margins when compared to PCs in general Furthermore share buybacks will reduce the share count by million shares to million shares based on my run rate calculation Therefore when combining all of those factors EPS growth could surprise analysts as I anticipate EPS to grow by yearoveryear Of course there could be some challenges to these expectations on earnings going forward For starters the PC client group would have to grow pretty robustly to offset the weakness in the first half of the current fiscal year On the other hand seasonal factors lead to sequential growth regardless of broader macro factors which helps to offset some of the negative impact earlier in the fiscal year So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to grow yearoveryear in the back half of the year that would equally offset a decline in revenue in the first two quarters of the year when pertaining specifically to the PC client group The PC client group shouldnt experience issues when pertaining to supply as theres a lot of capacity left to reach optimal demand it in the event demand proves to be relatively robust in the second half Furthermore I anticipate the data center group to continue to grow at a annualized rate as many of the new business categories that were mentioned earlier in the year at the data center day will not impact fiscal year earnings or revenues until fiscal year and Therefore my expectations when pertaining to other business segments is also fairly muted However this doesnt necessarily mean I am pessimistic as the expectations are set extremely low which sets the stock up for much more upside The stock has declined in the past six months however it is starting to recover in light of improvement in broader macro related sentiment and also because the business fundamentals are relatively strong when compared to expectations that were set earlier in the year Therefore I feel much more comfortable when forecasting upside in my price target due to the fact that there could be added momentum in terms of earnings multiple expansion and also in terms of earnings related growth as well With only three months left in the year I think that its fair to say that theres very little time for the stock to reach my price target however I feel fairly confident that the momentum will be relatively strong and will offset yeartodate losses Therefore I am initiating a price target of This implies that theres approximately upside from current levels Of course I know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a Dow component stock and for that rate of return to be reached the stock would be generating significant alpha relative to the broader market Im also aware that the odds of finding a blue chip gem are rare but with the stock trading at a healthy valuation and growth assumptions that have not been factored into the broader market consensus the stock is trading below fair value and will eventually trade at the price Im targeting The upside is high and further downside risk seems fairly minimal which makes it a very compelling buy Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
