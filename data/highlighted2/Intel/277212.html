outright decline yearoveryear Digitimes reports Apple suppliers cutting production below earlier schedules Some go so far to say that the platform war is over and that Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and its Android OS platform have won Apple continues to have the strongest brand with Google and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT in second and third position That brand strength has been the linchpin of Apples success in my opinion and cannot be ignored as a strong foundation for continued success Notwithstanding the strength of the Apple brand it is clear that Android has become the de facto mobile standard with over of smartphone shipments using Android OS Of course Android is like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC was in PCs in that it is not a smartphone brand but rather provides a smartphone component By allowing any vendor to use its Android OS free of charge Google has increased competition in the smartphone space and the war is no longer Apple versus Samsung OTCSSNLF but more correctly Apple and Samsung versus everyone else Moreover everyone else is winning Does this remind anyone of the PC wars of the s First it was Apple versus IBM NYSE IBM and in no time it was Apple versus everyone else with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside commanding the lions share of the PC vendors offerings primarily running Microsofts Windows OS The result was Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>holding a commanding almost of the PC market with Apple stuck in a niche Mobile seems to follow the same path with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM providing the application processors and Google providing the OS and Apple in danger of finding itself a niche player using its own OS and APs The game is now between Apple and Google with Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>largely absent with neither having a meaningful share of the mobile market The real growth in smartphone competition is a plethora of Android assemblers whose share of market is growing rapidly at the expense of both Samsung and Apple The competitive advantage of Apples brand is today overwhelmed by the sheer number of Android users In addition to its powerful brand Apples early success was based on a rich and fast growing library of applications unmatched by any other smartphone supplier It was the absence of such a library that spelled the end for BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY and threatens to do the same to Microsofts Windows phone BlackBerry has now introduced an Android OS phone as a lastditch effort to survive while Windows is attempting a bold differentiation based on Windows for all form factors hoping that will appeal to developers The future for Android and iOS is to some degree going to be a function of their respective applications libraries The question is not only which is stronger today but also can either step out ahead and command the support of the worldwide developer community I think the answer to both questions is Android Developers still make more money on the App Store than Google Play That may be changing New applications on Google Play represent more revenue than do new applications on the App Store The war will rage on and should make it an interesting race Digital Trends gives the edge to Android across a wide range of metrics but calls it close Interestingly the Digital Trends survey credits Microsoft Windows mobile OS with high scores on user interface and basic phone functions limited primarily by its relatively weak applications library What seems clear in Apples key Q for is that iPhone sales are lagging and more than likely will surprise to the downside My estimates for the quarter put iPhone sales at million and that may be aggressively high The super cycle created by the iPhone in has passed and in my opinion pulled demand from the current year The risk of such an event was well assessed by Tyler Durden in an excellent article in August For Q I foresee sales of billion and net income of about billion For any other company these would be stunningly good results but for Apple they represent the onset of declining performance a meaningful decline from sales of billion and net income of billion last year The stock will surely follow lower We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
