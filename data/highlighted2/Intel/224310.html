<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Is Better Positioned Than Qualcomm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha While its true that Qualcomm will have a better modem than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the practicality of a faster modem has been mitigated due to networkspecific constraints Aside from better marketability there isnt a legitimate reason for packaging a faster modem In other words the uplinkdownlink speeds of Qualcomms upcoming modem is overkill This exposes a weakness in Qualcomms business model as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can simply price more competitively to gain modem designs over the next month period Furthermore Qualcomm has shown a pattern of declining G LTE modem share over the past two years and this pattern is unlikely to change going forward However green shoots are starting to form at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as the company has demonstrated a pattern of stabilization in the PC segment and growth in servers and mobile For the most part Intels NASDAQ INTC stock price has continued to rally over the past couple months Some of this is driven by the momentum that leads up to the endofyear shareholder meeting Analysts really look forward to this event because management shares a lot more insight into company earnings and its cost structure at the end of year shareholder meeting For the most part though I can get a basic sense for why investors are starting to get a lot more optimistic as the company has demonstrated that it has been able to gain some mobile share and may be on the cusp of winning key modem designs with Apple NASDAQ AAPL While rumors are just rumors theres no denying that the company could compete with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM with an inferior modem design assuming they adjust their pricing After all unlike PCs where the CPU is the most expensive component the modem is the most expensive piece of silicon inside of a smartphone Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>prices its modem low enough Apple will likely bite After all I dont anticipate a noticeable difference in average uplink and downlink speeds due to the lack of network capacity to accommodate for higher average data speeds within the United States The upcoming x MDM series performance improvement doesnt seem as significant when compared to the x MDM series After all Qualcomm states that the average data down link is mbps whereas data up link is mbps the uplink speed improves by x when transitioning from the prior generation However these are peak speeds which means that this is the maximum amount of data packets that the modem processor can realistically handle However current network providers never come anywhere near close to the packet processing capabilities of current modems due to cost constraints The density of mobile stations would need to increase considerably to drive network wide improvements in average speed but because telecoms are highly price competitive theyve lowered data pricing which has pressured bandwidth on all of the major telecoms due to higher data usage When looking strictly at the United States the network is the biggest bottleneck to wireless data transfer rates and not the modems within smartphone handsets In other words you could package an older modem from two to three generations ago and you would not see speeds that are significantly slower My Samsung Galaxy S has slower uplink and downlink speeds to my MacBook Pro but when running speed benchmarks on the same WiFi both modems produce the same results The internet service provider is the bottleneck and not the modems Hence Apple could get away with packaging an inferior modem without any noticeable impact to the user experience as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>XMM modem is expected to top out at mbps downlinkuplink which is well above the average network speed Hence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt need to provide the bestinclass modem but rather the least expensive G LTE modem that can keep pace with average network speeds for the foreseeable two to threeyear period When looking over Intels mobile market share there has been a consistent trend in market sharesales improvement The volumes have been nominal but theres no denying that Qualcomm is starting to lose its grip of LTE Baseband unit market share which is what contributed to the drastic decline in its valuation While performance is a key aspect of winning designs it seems OEMs are far more sensitive to pricing because having faster modems doesnt really amount to anything Theres no pressing need to package faster modems and much of the growth is in the lowend where consumers could easily scrape by with basic G LTE designs With the exception of Apple everyone else is operating on razor thin margins and not implementing higher cost components whenever necessary seems to be the path to the least resistance We saw the same pattern emerge in the PC OEM space in the mid s as Dell and HP focused on providing the key components that drive performance but would often skimp on power supply units and chipset expandability In an effort to lower cost at the mid to entry level Dell would ship out PCs with W power supply units cheap commodity RAM sticks and motherboards without any expandability Now anyone who followed computing back in the mids knows that a good motherboard and power supply unit can extend the life of a PC considerably as you could switch out components as they become dated but the OEMs didnt care Just like the mobile OEMs of today will begin cutting corners whenever possible to preserve margins and remain somewhat competitive So where does this leave Qualcomm Well its going to have to price down its SKUs and leverage its global volume and key supplier relationships to price aggressively But that really hasnt resonated with shareholders as gross margins have been pressured due to a variety of reasons On the QTL side operating metrics weakened due to lower royalty rates in China but on the QCT side it was lower pricing on slowing volumes Hence the only real reason for buying Qualcomm is due to its low valuation when compared to the average market valuation Theres no denying that balance sheet metrics have been strong and various efforts to appease shareholders through higher buyback authorization have put a floor underneath QCOM stock The competitive dynamics of the space havent been good for Qualcomm and given how forward looking markets are its no wonder <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is gaining momentum There are fewer holes to Intels business model and while growth is limited in terms of PC units there has been a lot of momentum in higher margin categories Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has demonstrated that it can at least sustain a healthy growth rate and once PCs bottom out the growth trajectory seems appealing given its relatively low valuation times earnings Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains the better choice between the two We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
