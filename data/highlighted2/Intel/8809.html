Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and TSMC have close to the same market cap but have radically different sales and trajectories <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is losing badly in the growing mobile market while TSMC expansion with it will allow a larger Capex than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in One of the more alarming phenomenon I have come across while posting and writing on Seeking Alpha is the attitude of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC investors toward their company It concerns me that they at least those that comment and write are generally noncritical to an alarming degree Its easy to understand because the company makes money and has been for quite some time but doubts are healthy particularly with a company that is not growing in a market that is Intels recent fall where the company warned that desktop PC sales did not meet expectations is just another weak sign in the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is addicted to Yet for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>failure abounds everywhere else they try Similarly many consider AMD NASDAQ AMD Intels main competitor but in this article I am going to present a different company that better reflects the issues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>faces Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE TSM hereafter referred to as TSMC The two are at the crossroads where once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was far ascendant While Intels failures have sapped its strength the continued growth of the mobile market has contributed to the burgeoning power of TSMC so much so that TSMC will invest more in Capex than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in Interestingly these opposing trajectories currently leave the market cap of both companies similar Billion for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Billion for TSMC as of this writing The PE favors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>slightly at compared to for TSMC Where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still enjoys a very favorable edge is PriceSales which is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and for TSMC I have always considered PS more meaningful than PE because it varies much less from quarter to quarter but everyone has their own ideas on that Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>enjoys a substantial PS advantage the trajectories of the companies clearly favor TSMC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems incapable of growth having failed to profitably enter newer growth markets TSMC has clearly benefited from the same market changes that have marginalized <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Although indirectly TSMC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are competitors and when one wins it narrows the opportunities for the other Of course Intels use of TSMC for the initial SoFIA products contradicts this However this is mainly because of Intels slow development speed which still has not moved the technologies they purchased from Infineon onto their own fabs Clearly this is the exception and is only a short term situation So which of these two will win TSMC has a far better chance of defeating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mainly because they are part of a coalition of companies that dwarf <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in resources and are currently doing far better They have Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Apple NASDAQ AAPL ARM NASDAQ ARMH NVIDIA NASDAQ NVDA etc all working with them although not always entirely Both Apple and Qualcomm have completely dominated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the phone and tablet market leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to look for the scraps that fall off the table Without the processor development skill of these companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was forced to pay tablet makers to use their CPUs while completely missing the phone market The latter will change with SoFIA entering the lowend phone market in however <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>so far has not seen much success in the IoT market while ARM vendors currently do quite well Thats the strength of TSMC they have partners and if they have success TSMC often does too But not always <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>although certainly lacking the resources of the enormous coalition building processors at TSMC has very important advantages While TSMC profits from chips sold by its partners this is not nearly as significant as the profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes when it does presuming they are not subsidizing the chips Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a more stable market than TSMC which could lose important contracts to competitors like Samsung OTCSSNLF and its accessory Global Foundries Well go into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each company starting with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still owns the PC market with AMD being hopelessly outclassed in the higherend of the market Although shrinking it should remain large for the foreseeable future and be a constant source of profits for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>while it attempts to succeed in other growing markets Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has more experience in FinFets and is on their second node whereas both Samsung and TSMC are still very early in the learning curve One most note though that even while using FinFets against planar products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has not been successful in the mobile market and the relative situation in fabrication technology is less favorable in and will be particularly so in as competitors ramp their FinFets Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has also shown interest of using its fabs for other companies and this could eventually provide substantial revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>they are currently noncompetitive with TSMC and Samsung in terms of tools costs and accessibility By contrast TSMC does not have anything approaching the security of selling their own processors into a wellestablished market Apple is an enormous source of revenue for TSMC currently but this is no way guarantees future revenue as Apple has used Samsung in the past Many believe Apple was behind the licensing of Samsungs nm FinFet technology to Global Foundries supply of nm wafers from Samsung alone may not be sufficient in for Apples A and their own Exynos processors If true this would strongly imply at least some of Apples next generation production will be at Samsung In fact Samsung beat TSMC to FinFets and even TSMCs CEO Morris Chang accepted that Samsung will outship TSMC in FinFets this year while believing TSMC will ship more in when the market for FinFets is considerably larger Although the big news lately was a report indicating TSMC will be getting of Apples next generation A processor revenue this seems dubious Given the timing of the release of Apples products and that it generally takes roughly months considering both design time and production time it seems much more likely SamsungGloFo will be the vendor for the A parts Considering Global Foundries is currently installing capacity for FinFets but will have no business from AMD in it seems even more likely TSMC will not see Apples A business In fact this report which seems more sensible to me given the time constraints indicates the same The link also indicates Apple leaving x for ARM on their Macs which I consider inevitable Although Morris Chang derisively referred to Global Foundries as Samsungs accessory it is dangerous to dismiss it so frivolously Because of its relationship with AMD and IBM GloFo is not without assets In the past AMD had used TSMC extensively for video cards and also some of their lower end APUs While AMD has not closed the door on TSMC and may use them in the future the relationship has clearly been diminished as AMD has moved virtually all its production to Global Foundries One point that is rarely brought up is IBMs fabrication technology and Global Foundries IBM has very advanced processes and is continuing to develop it despite the sale of all but one of their fabrication which is kept for development purposes facilities IBMs nm FDSOI FinFet seems extremely well suited for their server parts which could provide a useful process for other companies wishing to develop CPUs in this segment Qualcomm which is currently using TSMCs nm planar technology is believed to be using Samsungs FinFets for its next node at least initially NVIDIA has complained bitterly in the past about the cost of nm planar at TSMC although it appears the density and price have improved dramatically since then Even so although likely it is not certain NVIDIA will choose TSMC It is not only in the latest nodes where TSMC has some exposure Although Intels management likes to talk about Moores Law and how they are committed to it it died many years ago and now just means an advancement in fabrication processes regardless of timeframe However even with the lengthening timespans the benefits moving from node to node do not approach those of a decade ago As such older nodes and in particular nm planar will likely live a very long time perhaps indefinitely Recently it was announced that TSMCs February sales were significantly down month to month Its difficult to consider this anything but fluff as year to year sales were significantly up and February not only has fewer days than January it also has more holidays in Taiwan More than this due to the lead time involved in production short term blips are not meaningful Even so there clearly there are risks for TSMC They have partners but these partners are free to choose other foundries and the SamsungGloFoIBM partnership is formidable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to get into the foundry business but they are hopelessly behind real foundries in many parameters and its not clear if their choices in process are as well targeted as TSMCs in SoCs After all Intels priority is always their mainstream Core processors On a positive note MediaTek is also rumored to be choosing TSMC over Samsung Overall TSMC is predicting growth in and they have pretty good visibility due to the lead time involved in these partnerships Much of it no doubt will continue to be nm Apple parts and some will probably be the continued success of their nm processes Which brings us to another strength of the company Many consider the newest processes as all thats important but this not nearly the case for TSMC They continue to get solid revenue from processes as high as nm More than that these older processes are improved upon when TSMC learns from newer processes Not every business needs the newest technology so TSMC continues to provide and improve useful older technology and it represents a significant revenue stream However Samsung has demonstrated interest in using FDSOI on nm which in Q generated of TSMCs revenue and likely will remain an important revenue node Using FDSOI would give very good performance exceeding even nm planar on bulk silicon while costing essentially the same as nm bulk silicon This could be very attractive as it is much easier for companies to design on compared to later nodes and the costs for taping out are significantly lower than on FinFets close to an order of magnitude This makes it particularly attractive to that are not large enough to afford smaller nodes We now know that there are over tapeouts for TSMCs FF process and we also know their growth in Capex indicates the pipeline will remain strong in with more significant growth in when the FF process ramps and perhaps Apple chooses it for their A line of processors In fact one of TSMCs advantages over Samsung is they are a pureplay foundry and do not compete with their customers This has to make them more attractive to Apple which not only competes with Samsung but also has a history of lawsuits against the company Coupled with the strong performance and yields for the FF line and its very likely TSMC will enjoy significant design wins in When looking at both companies their situations are radically different One was very powerful but constant failure and the move to mobile has rendered it somewhat impotent and irrelevant outside of a shrinking legacy market This market seems very secure and is very profitable however There is the risk of a resurgent AMD with its introduction of Zen is which could fundamentally alter Intels profits in this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has no chance of winning the mainstream tablet market as they have poor technology that has not been competitive and has become less competitive with time The fast growing lowend phone market is a real opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but the general incompetence of management has to temper hopes there IoT offers perhaps the best chance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but again the lethargy and consistent failure of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management make any success seem difficult to predict That is the risk for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Victories mean more but they seem unattainable for the degenerate giant But history tells us that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can turn things around quickly as they did in TSMC is far from perfect having lost the race to FinFets with Samsung and likely the next iPhone sales with it The company also competes with Samsung very directly as well its current partner Global Foundries The PriceSales is less than half Intels which even with their current trajectory will take time to overcome However there is no doubt they are growing with the mobile market even if it is uneven at times and this growth gives the company more resources to expand further to the extent its CapEx will exceed Intels in should be a breakout year as their advanced FF process ramps up and designs move into production albeit with the fewer nm Apple processor shipments Although the FinFets and the continuing growth of mobile ARM processors should fuel most of the growth its also important to remember the older process nodes for TSMC make a solid profit and are a stable business that shows no sign of waning Anything can happen in technology and no one can say for sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue on the path of failure especially with some promising products like SoFIA and Quark However TSMCs path to success seems so much more likely Its partners show no signs of letting up and continue to release exciting technologies that go into products that people want The companys IP both with older nodes and the new FF node looks very strong and shows promise as the company appears to be leading in EUV development and is aggressively moving to their nm node For the first time TSMCs CapEx will exceed Intels in showing just how dramatically the company has grown For this reason I believe TSMC will soon surpass <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in market cap and be a stronger investment as we move into the latter part of the decade Intels management leaves me cold as does their inability to make compelling technology in the tablet and phone market Hope remains for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but Ill take substantial Apple contracts over vague notions of hope Either way it will be interesting to see how the mobile revolution reassembles the players and where they sit when it stabilizes Source <span
