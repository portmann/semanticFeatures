class='textDiv'>Micron To Talk About NonVolatile Memory Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha Micron rushed out news of its D XPoint Memory in July and then nothing D NAND has been mentioned in several analyst days but has remained vaporware Back on July Micron Technology NASDAQ MU and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC held a hurriedly scheduled press conference to announce D XPoint memory with amazing slides like this one Why this was such a rush given that parts still havent been seen in the wild is still a mystery At the time many of us observed that Microns CEO Mark Durcan looked extremely uncomfortable on stage with the voluble cheery head of D XPoint from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>INTC Rob Crooke Thats Durcan on the right He is not wearing handcuffs even though it looks like it This picture is presque vu of this memorable recent hostage scene where it looks like Mr Christie is wondering what he is doing on stage with the other fellow Analysts and articles mentioned that D XPoint would sample in and ship in So far we are still waiting on both events And while its unclear why this rushed announcement was made it is now apparent that a lot of operating system and application software changes had to be made to take advantage of this speedy new memory My thesis on the rushed announcement is that Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needed to signal developers that they needed to begin work to accommodate this brand new type of chip Here is an excellent video published March in which Intels Rick Coulson discusses some of the technical challenges and opportunities of using D XPoint as a Storage Class Memory and in super speedy solid state drives I think this video also gives some insight into why Microns Mr Durcan looked so uncomfortable during the July unveiling Without software these chips would remain a curiosity Micron doesnt have the market position to dictate driver development and has been behind in controller hardware and controller software for all of its nonvolatile memory offerings In the video Intels Coulson admits that some of their interfaces will be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>proprietary Theres a lot of laughter in the video around the prospect presumably delayed from Intels efforts of ARM and other processor hardware makers catching up with Intels drivers and firmware In the past week there have been two announcements that make me think the long wait from vaporware announcements to hardware loose in the wild may finally be over First is Microns invitation to its April Webcast join Micron for a LIVE webcast on April at am CST During this webcast Micron executives customers and partners will discuss the exciting suite of Micron SSDs and Micron Accelerated Solutions and how they will help transform the data center from the current legacy IT infrastructure to a more agile environment Webcast to include presentations by Mark Durcan President CEO discussing Microns vision commitment in storage Darren Thomas VP GM Storage Business Unit sharing how the data center infrastructure is undergoing a massive transformation Steve Moyer VP Storage Software Engineering discussing storage innovations happening at the Micron Storage Solutions Center in Austin TX Eric Endebrock VP Storage Marketing revealing new products and solutions Jon Carter VP Storage Emerging Memory providing a D XPoint update Mark Glasgow VP Enterprise Sales sharing how realworld customers are solving data challenges using flash I suspect that most of the April presentation will be devoted to D NAND which will be most welcome But the listing of Jon Carter above and the promise of an update on D XPoint will be particularly welcome Both are long overdue The second significant announcement of the week is Intels latest reshuffling of its deck in terms of financial reporting covered here in a SA news announcement A key point here is breaking out NSG a newly sliced and diced segment for the NonVolatile Memory Solutions Group Why break it out if it isnt going to be a significant deal Micron has recently reiterated this bold prediction For NAND were ramping Gen D NAND in Singapore and expect to have more than of our NAND bit fab bit output on D by the fall of And in last summers analyst conference Microns Mark Durcan blurted out this poorly phrased but remarkable prediction In the time frame D XPoint could easily be of the same order of magnitude as our DRAM businesses in that timeframe So maybe not the same size maybe half the size in While these are two gamechanging predictions the absence of visible tangible hardware has caused analysts and investors to yawn in disbelief Perhaps the April meeting will begin to change that perception Like many of you I was fortunate to stumble upon Russ Fischers early Micron articles here on Seeking Alpha His guidance on Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>led me to a sevenfigure portfolio profit Had I exited Micron when he did this might have remained a mid sevenfigure number I count Russ as a friend and a knowledgeable source who carried a bag his parlance for selling semiconductors for years I was stricken when he was stricken with two strokes His unfortunate story on that front can be seen on Caring Bridge Drop him a message there I can happily report that Russ is coming back STRONG Hes been reading research and emails a number of us have sent him on his favorite semiconductor companies Hes continued with wry comments on some sell side analysts As recently as a phone call today he advised Id get into some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LEAP options for I think memory can push the stock up to per share by then Vintage Russ Fischer and this could be an even better return than his memorable buy and hold x time return on Micron LEAP options should his bullish stock price prediction be realized While Im not yet fully signing up to another of Russs buoyant stock price predictions I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may be the safer way to play this Micron April announcement Micron has just flagged that the next quarter will be another loss Samsung OTCSSNLF has just beat them to the x node in DRAM And they are in the worrisome arena of building inventory as prices continue to plummet So perhaps gamblers can buy some near term slightly out of the money Micron options And of course the Russ Fischer faithful will buy some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LEAP options I think I will be both a gambler and a Russ Fischer acolyte in addition to my small stock positions in both names Its been too long since weve heard anything new and tangible from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron on nonvolatile memory This will be a welcome update The even more welcome news is that Russ is still at it and I suspect will be providing his guidance wry humor and vitriol on these pages soon Disclosure I amwe are long MU INTC I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
