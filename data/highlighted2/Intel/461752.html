revenue could surprise the Street If the client computing group delivers revenue close to billion which isnt impossible Intels overall revenue could exceed billion In that case shares of the company should rally post earnings and gradually advance toward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC will release its second quarter earnings on July after market close The analyst community is estimating that on average Intels EPS will be on revenue of billion In the first quarter Intels EPS came in at beating analysts estimates significantly on revenue of billion The companys client computing group revenue showed a sign of stabilization driven by better than expected PC and mobile processor sales in the first quarter For the second quarter I expect that if Intels revenue exceeds billion its shares will march toward Although a few experts believe that stronger PC demand will bode well for Intels client computing group CCG I dont believe theres enough reason to be too optimistic However due to the ongoing PC gaming bandwagon I prefer to be fairly optimistic IDC forecasted that PC sales will continue to decline in the current year IDC projected YoY decline in worldwide PC shipments this year primarily driven by depressed commodity prices and weak international currencies visvis USD The only silver lining in the cloud is the PC gaming market According to a report by Jon Peddie Research JPR which tracks the gaming market PC gaming hardware market will resume growth in The report said The global PC gaming hardware market is forecast to slightly recede in but but less than the overall PC market and then resume growth in The boutique builders agree with JPRs findings Jon Back founder of Puget Systems a boutique builder said At Puget Systems our high end gaming PC sales have never been better Windows Skylake K VR and a strong year of gaming title launches has made a strong year for enthusiast gaming PCs and we expect to be even stronger For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the rising demand for gaming PCs is good news amid all the doom and gloom related to the eroding traditional PC client business The chipmaker launched its BroadwellE processor lineup at Computex in Taipei in the second quarter targeted at highend desktops used in PC gaming including VR The BroadwellE lineup will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offset revenue loss from generalpurpose PCs chips to an extent In a previous article I shared my view regarding Intels BroadwellE lineup As far as mobile chip sales are concerned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is wellpositioned with winning modem chip orders from Apple NASDAQ AAPL for the latters upcoming iPhone due for release in this fall As a result abandoning lowend Atom line of processors for mobile wont adversely affect Intels overall mobile revenue Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri believes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could supply more than half of iPhone modems and possibly displace Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM entirely from the Apple supply chain With iPhone hitting the markets globally in September its entirely possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already started to supply modems to Apple and the CCG revenue in the second quarter should reflect this to an extent In the first quarter Intels CCG revenue came in at billion down sequentially and up YoY YoY growth in the first quarter however small indicated that the secular decline in Intels CCG revenue was arrested I expect that in the second quarter the chipmakers CCG revenue will remain flat to slightly positive sequentially The CCG revenue should be in the range of to billion primarily driven by PC gaming and modem supply to Apple After fifteen months of launching the Broadwell architecture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>brought Broadwell in the server market with the launch of multisocket BroadwellEP at the end of first quarter In Intels first quarter earnings preview I wrote The economics of the datacenter hardware industry is gradually shifting toward demanddriven price increase With enterprises and governments across the world continuing to outsource data hosting and processing to thirdparty providers available space for building cloud datacenters is becoming scarce and as a result price of cloudbased services is gradually rising This phenomenon in turn is supporting higher prices for server processors In the first quarter Intels datacenter group DCG revenue came in at billion The second quarter should see a sequential increase in DCG revenue of approximately to billion driven by increasing adoption of Xeon E v processor family based on BroadwellEP Since the Xeon E v series has more serveroriented features as well as features for virtualized servers new cloud datacenter buildouts across the world will certainly adopt it to support their hyperscale cloud deployments Further Intels strategy to keep hyperscale datacenter operators engaged with it via acquiring Altera will also start to bear fruit and reflect in its DCG revenue Revenue from Intels programmable solutions group which includes Altera business should be in the range of million to million With the telecom and wireless industry continuing to grow satisfactorily in primarily driven by explosion of mobile devices and broadband connectivity demand for Alteras FPGAs will remain strong Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already started pairing Alteras Arria FPGAs with its Xeon E v processors However I have factored in this development in Intels DCG revenue As far as Intels security business is concerned I expect that revenue should be impressive due to decent enterprise demand Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is planning to sell off its security business in order to narrow its focus on IoT Internet of Things and cloud computing business I dont expect them to sell off the entire security unit This is because the company would find it difficult to survive without providing chiplevel security in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Securitys Bruce Snell said in an interview earlier this year Part of our job at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Security is to make sure that were working with the carriers and the manufacturers to really start thinking about security and really take it very seriously In future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will embed its security solutions in hardware at an increasing rate and put less emphasis on selling security software In that case it may sell off its softwarebased security business I expect that Intels security revenue will be around million in the second quarter Intels nonvolatile memory solutions group revenue could be a bit softer in the second quarter because businesses are likely to postpone buying Intels SSDs until the company releases its muchawaited D XPointbased Optane line of SSDs Revenue is expected to be below million Finally I expect that Chipzillas IoT group revenue should see robust growth The basis of my expectation is Gartners prediction according to which billion things ie devices will be connected to the Internet by the end of this year In the first quarter Intels IoT group revenue came in at million up YoY Revenue from this group should cross million in the second quarter Intels revenue from the groups under the other groups category should amount to around billion Whether Intels second quarter revenue crosses billion or not will depend on its CCG revenue If CCG delivers close to billion in revenue total revenue could easily cross billion beating analysts estimates by a wide margin If that really happens I expect its share price to touch Disclosure I amwe are long INTC QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
