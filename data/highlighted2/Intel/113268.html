(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most importantly, the process also appears to be much easier than what Apple developers face in moving apps between Mac OS X and iOS, which, of course, do run on different hardware platforms. (Uncertainty) </span>Here we see an important benefit of the convergence that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has so often disparaged.Based on recent events, the Build/Investor Meeting conference, and my reading of Microsoft's strategy, I think it's clear that Microsoft doesn't have particularly high expectations for Windows Phone this year.If the intention is to create a discriminator for Windows Phone through its desktop Continuum feature, this does at least offer something fairly exclusive.On the other hand, the desktop capabilities of the phone are likely to be very limited in the near term.There's only so much processing power you can squeeze into a phone.If Microsoft doesn't have very high expectations (in the near term at least) for Windows Phone, neither should investors.The focus for Microsoft is clearly where it should be.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Gone is the Ballmer hubris of assuming that Microsoft could conquer smartphones as it had conquered PCs. (Uncertainty) </span>The realization has set in that the crucial battle for Microsoft is primarily defensive: preserving what is still the largest personal computing ecosystem on the planet."Mobilization" of this ecosystem is the right strategy for Microsoft.I expect we'll here more about how this battle is going at Microsoft's upcoming earnings conference call, to which I will pay careful attention.Source: Microsoft 'Mobilizes' The PC Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
