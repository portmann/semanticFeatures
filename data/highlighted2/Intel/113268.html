the write off was not good news in itself the new strategy is The new strategy is to convert as quickly as possible its current Windows PC ecosystem into a modern mobile device ecosystem Reactions to Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Nokia write off have ranged from admiring to harshly critical here on SA What has been lacking in these reactions is an understanding of Microsofts new mobile strategy and how it differs from the Ballmer era Microsofts strategy is to mobilize as in convert to the mobile device paradigm its current user base of about billion Windows PCs This strategy has many near and longterm ramifications which I discuss in this article Reactions to the write off have ranged from Salazars admiring Microsoft Nadella Continues To Lead With Distinction to Hartungs critical Microsoft A Billion WriteOff Plus Layoffs Are Never Good Signs I found myself enjoying both articles and agreeing in part with both However what both articles seem to lack is cognizance of Microsofts mobile device strategy going forward This is understandable Hartung correctly takes Nadella to task for not articulating a strategy I consider Nadella one of the most intelligent if not the most intelligent CEOs in tech but he has a tendency to wax philosophical The result is vague pronouncements and a lack of specifics Part of this Im sure is deliberate Microsoft simply doesnt want to divulge important elements of its mobile device strategy So a lot of sifting of clues needs to be done and the best source of information about Microsofts future directions in mobile devices and PCs came from its combined Build developer conference and financial analyst meeting at the end of April The keynotes for both meetings provide the best set of clues to work with It was clear to me after watching the keynotes that Microsoft was in full retreat on the smartphone front In past Builds developers were treated to a parade of the latest Windows phones Not this time While Microsoft still displayed a willingness to be cross platform Windows on Raspberry Pi the emphasis was all on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>based mobile devices mostly tablets or in convertibles The most significant demonstration involving Windows Phone was a demonstration of the Windows Continuum feature involving a Windows phone When a desktop monitor was plugged into the phone the phone transformed via Continuum to a desktop mode with windows and desktop like apps During the demo it was made clear that the phone wasnt yet available I believe this is the case because it was running an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC processor probably of the Atom X class formerly known as SoFIA The ability to smoothly transform from a tablet tile based interface to a window based UI is the hallmark of the Continuum feature Probably Continuum only works well on Intelbased devices Another important clue to the retrenchment was the stated goal to have at least billion devices running Windows in years This was very telling It conveyed to me that Microsoft has finally realized that its most important imperative is to retain as many of its current estimated billion Windows users and convert them to the modern platform of Windows How important this is to Microsoft can be seen in the fact that Microsoft is going to give away Windows upgrades for the first year of release At the developer conference Microsoft promised important ecosystem features for Windows that are really only possible if Win is predominantly an Intelbased OS The first was a greater degree of backward compatibility with older Windows apps The second was the ability of developers to create truly universal apps that would run on all Win devices from phones to PCs Both of these goals imply that Win is mostly an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>OS Combined with the discontinuance of Windows RT and manufacturing of the ARMbased Surface tablets the focus has clearly shifted back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The latest Surface tablet now sports and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom X processor While Microsoft left the door officially open to making Win available for nonIntel devices there doesnt seem to be much interest either from OEMs or from Microsoft In many ways the process of mobilization is already underway in the Windows PC world Most Windows PCs sold today are already to some degree mobile They are laptops ultralights ins or tablets that run Windows Ive long advocated that Microsoft switch to an allIntel approach This would allow Windows to achieve true backward compatibility with existing PC software something that Windows on ARM devices could never provide It also would allow true universal apps that would run on all Windows devices In this way Windows developers would automatically become mobile app developers for Microsoft sponsored mobile devices With Windows the very strong indication is that Microsoft has embraced this approach Why be so cagey about it Well primarily because Microsoft is still trying to sell a lot of ARMbased Lumia phones designs inherited from the Nokia era I consider it inevitable that just as Microsoft switched the nonPro Surface to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Microsoft will switch its smartphones as well Windows is primarily about achieving mobilization of the Windows ecosystem It solves the ecosystem problem that Windows never could With Win Microsoft tried to coax its existing PC developers into developing for its Windows Phone and Windows RT ARM platforms by consolidating the development tools into one Integrated Development Environment IDE Merely colocating the tools in a single software package wasnt enough The underlying hardware differences between ARM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>meant that much legacy Windows code simply wasnt portable to ARM devices With Win universal apps running on a unified <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture the promise of cross platform compatibility that was never achieved in Win gets much closer to reality There may still be some hiccups in porting a Win app from a desktop to a phone but the process appears to be much easier than with Win Most importantly the process also appears to be much easier than what Apple developers face in moving apps between Mac OS X and iOS which of course do run on different hardware platforms Here we see an important benefit of the convergence that Apple NASDAQ AAPL has so often disparaged Based on recent events the BuildInvestor Meeting conference and my reading of Microsofts strategy I think its clear that Microsoft doesnt have particularly high expectations for Windows Phone this year If the intention is to create a discriminator for Windows Phone through its desktop Continuum feature this does at least offer something fairly exclusive On the other hand the desktop capabilities of the phone are likely to be very limited in the near term Theres only so much processing power you can squeeze into a phone If Microsoft doesnt have very high expectations in the near term at least for Windows Phone neither should investors The focus for Microsoft is clearly where it should be Gone is the Ballmer hubris of assuming that Microsoft could conquer smartphones as it had conquered PCs The realization has set in that the crucial battle for Microsoft is primarily defensive preserving what is still the largest personal computing ecosystem on the planet Mobilization of this ecosystem is the right strategy for Microsoft I expect well here more about how this battle is going at Microsofts upcoming earnings conference call to which I will pay
