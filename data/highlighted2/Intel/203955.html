technologies will propel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to billion in revenue New memory will allow processors to live up their performance promise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is a transistor company Transistors are little switching devices that didnt exist on planet earth years ago Since then transistors have been aggregated into devices that compute These computing devices have moved on to control systems like the Internet The Internet is a system that is capable of storing most of the knowledge humanity has acquired about our world and retrieving pieces of that knowledge in mere seconds for anyone who has one of these computing tools That first crude transistor begat modern integrated circuits manufactured by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and other semiconductor transistor companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the acknowledged leader of this technology miracle making integrated circuits containing billions of transistors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been the keeper of Moores Law the driving principle that recognized that the number of circuit elements in an integrated circuit could double every two years That meant that anything electronic could increase in function and decrease in cost at an astonishing rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now a billion company employing over people worldwide of whom are PhDs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is as close to a corporate think tank on computing and computing related materials research as exists in the world I have had the privilege of watching this corporate miracle come into existence and progress to its current leadership position of today Where does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>go from here and how do you get rich investing in this amazing company Ive been writing for a couple of years now that the holy grail of computing will see memory and storage integrated with processors to obtain the very highest levels of performance with the lowest possible power consumption I have to admit that I wasnt exactly sure how this would happen It seemed that Moores Law progress might stop a couple of shrink steps short of realizing the ultimate integration goal You see the package that houses the microprocessor for PCs and servers has a footprint of only a couple of square inches smaller than that for smartphone application processors At the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investor meeting the company gave a glimpse of their approach to D NAND that would allow a sizable SSD Solid State Drive to be parked right beside the processor chip in a single package The only show stopper after this revelation was how to get enough system RAM inside that same package Enough DRAM for a typical system would require over a square inch of silicon area far too much to shoehorn into the processor package On July th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron NASDAQ MU showed us how that system memory would shrink enough to get inside the processor package Instead of DRAM a new technology was introduced called D Cross Point Memory Diane Bryant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Vice President of the data center business tells us about D XP beginning at minute of this video For now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>intends to offer a product line called Optane that will offer DXP based DIMM Dual in Line Memory Module modules to extend system RAM in servers Right now if a massive amount of system memory is required the only choice is DRAM DRAM is relatively expensive and volatile The Optane DIMMs will provide massive amounts of less expensive nonvolatile RAM connected to the system memory bus The Optane line also will offer extreme performance SSDs based on DXP memory These SSDs will find applications where NANDbased SSDs are not fast enough It turns out that over of all silicon wafers produced are memory wafers When considering that complex logic chips are over half static RAM the percentage of wafers that are dedicated memory probably exceeds Side note While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the largest semiconductor company by sales Samsung OTCSSNLF exceeds Intels wafer output by nearly a factor of three While Samsungs output is mostly memory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cannot fall further behind on total wafer output or they will eventually lose their sales leadership and maybe even their manufacturing technology leadership So there is a quiet conflict taking place between these two giants of the semiconductor industry Samsung cannot engage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the processor segment but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can engage Samsung in the memory segmentand they are doing exactly that D planar NAND has run out of gas at about nm making D NAND a necessity for continued cost and capacity scaling beyond Gb The first IntelMicron D NAND chip will be Gb at MLC or Gb at TLC Samsung which has been in D NAND production for a year is apparently having enough difficulties that they have been stuck at a Gb TLC chip Storage is one of those places where you make the highest capacity chip you can in order to make SSDs from as few chips as possible As Intels Rob Crooke said during the release of this technology If you could build a Gb chip you would implying that Samsung is unable to build a chip of Gb capacity with their D NAND technology The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>D NAND scaling roadmap includes vertical layer increases of up to and at least one traditional lithography shrink of The first chip out will be about sq mm and Gb GB The roadmap as we see today will quadruple the bit capacity of that sq mm to Gb or GB in steps over the next two years That would result in a GB SSD on a chip the size of my thumbnail If you want twice that capacity stacking NAND chips is easy and has been done for years A very costly D NAND wafer would have a manufacturing cost of not more than Each wafer would net about chips for a cost of per GB embedded SSD We can speculate on sales price but given the performance features and longer battery life it seems that for the GB SSD would not be out of line even for a client PC There are about million client CPU chips sold per year if each of those came with a SSD attached it would be billion of new business for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Data center storage systems would be much higher capacity more complex and much more expensive I see the data center SSD storage business at about billion So D NAND should lead to new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>business of billion to begin with the expensive lowhangingfruit of the data center in and progressing to the client business by The bottom line is that an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wafer of D NAND chips should cost about and generate minimum revenue of when configured as SSDs For those out there who think the memory business is always low margin note that this is gross margin Obviously there are other costs involved but the NAND margins will in any case be above the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>target It will take million wafers to serve the total market About of that capacity exists in the interest in the Lehi UT fab today with rumors floating around that Lehi is in the process of being doubled DXP memory is expected to be a low costofmanufacturing product so lets use per wafer This is an absolutely new product so we can only guess what the volume will be Im expecting one of these chips to eventually reside in every client PC and another million will be sold to the data center business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will need to produce million DXP chips at full market penetration By the time full penetration occurs the chip will be half the size it is today Lets assume sq mm chip size There will be chips per wafer at that size A million waferyear fab will satisfy my WAG market What should this thing sell for Lets assume half the price of DRAM or about GB At GB per chip it should sell for about That price would produce revenue of per wafer At cost gross margin would be and total sales would be nearly billion I think theres little doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the memory business and very soon will be even more committed to the memory business The two new memory technologies could represent billion in growth business for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>over the next three years Processor performance has been held back by the memory wall for more than a decade The last step in performance will be to include system memory and some level of storage in the CPU package That last move eliminates any possibility of competition for system memory and storage making high memory margin persistent No other semiconductor company can implement this strategy because very simply they dont have ownership of the X CPU business The present value of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with a growth rate of for four years and net margin and dividend would be Of course those numbers are not evident today I believe the fog will begin to clear by the end on I
