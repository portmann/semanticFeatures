of a Microsoft acquisition of AMD sent AMD shares higher on September Microsofts experience with the Nokia purchase precludes an AMD purchase As hopes for tangible financial progress fade investors in turnaround stocks such as AMD NASDAQ AMD tend to subsist increasingly on rumors and speculation The rumor on Friday that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT was discussing buying AMD caused the stock to pop by greater than Given its recent experience with Nokia Microsoft has undoubtedly lost its appetite for money losing hardware companies It was only last quarter that Microsoft took an billion charge to write off Nokia and cover restructuring costs Even if the media and AMD investors have forgotten I doubt that MS CEO Nadella has Nokia provides a case study in how not to become vertically integrated Buy a money losing business that is too large for its revenue stream in a business area smartphones that has already demonstrated a failed business strategy adoption of Windows Phone Then keep trudging along on the same failed path more Windows phones while cutting personnel In the end what Microsoft ended up with was nothing No successful product line and not even talent or IP to justify the purchase This is the meaning of the write down As of Q Windows Phone market share stood at just down from a year ago according to Gartner The only thing the Nokia purchase accomplished was that it spared Steve Ballmer the embarrassment of Nokia abandoning the Windows Phone platform for Android back in No such motivation exists for Satya Nadella for buying AMD Microsoft has not staked a corporate strategy on any AMD partnership outside of buying AMD semicustom processors for XBox One XBox platform revenue only represented million out of Microsofts billion in the June quarter If the Nokia experience isnt enough to discourage Microsoft from other such ventures there is the ever weakening market and financial position of AMD itself AMD has continued to lose market share to both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and its graphics rival Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA The net result has been a steep yy decline of in revenue in its Computing and Graphics Segment to million in the June quarter and an operating loss of million And of course no purchase of AMD would be complete without AMDs substantial billion in debt which consumes most of AMDs total assets of billion AMDs cash position also continues to erode dropping from billion last December to million in June Oh well AMD can always borrow more money There is some near term and longer term hope for AMD In the short term there is the Carrizo line of systems on chip SOCs that AMD insists on calling Accelerated Processing Units APUs These combine substantial AMD Radeon graphics as well as bit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>compatible CPU cores Carrizo is intended to target the most important PC market laptops and was announced with great fanfare in June Oddly I cant find much in the way of test data for Carrizo notebooks in order to compare Carrizo with Intels recently announced Skylake series of Core processors Theres some early benchmarking of a CarrizoL notebook with Intels previous gen Broadwell Core i where the i demonstrates superior performance All Ive found on AMDs top of the line Carrizo part the FXP is what appears to be a promo video showing that the Carrizo beats Broadwell The real question is how Carrizo stacks up against Skylake and on that point I can only offer an educated guess Based on what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>released at their IDF in San Francisco in August Skylake will probably close the gap in graphics performance with Carrizo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is claiming roughly a improvement in graphics performance compared to Broadwell and that should be enough to equal Carrizo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been building in successively more capable graphics in each generation of Core processor and with Skylake <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has evolved a flexible graphics architecture that allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to add slices of graphics processing units in order to increasing processing power Ill reserve final judgment until I see test data from both Skylake and Carrizo Skylake achieving performance parity in graphics probably dooms Carrizo to also ran status <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the advantage of its nm process vs nm for Carrizo The process advantage is really starting to take its toll on AMDs market share For general purpose computing I cant see Microsoft being willing to bet on AMD and clearly Surface and Surface Pro reflect that In the longer term AMD has a new much faster CPU core architecture Zen and the promise of fabrication on a nm scale FinFET process by either TSMC NYSE TSM or Global Foundries As Ive discussed previously this may make AMDs chips more compelling for ultralight form factor notebooks and even attract the interest of Apple NASDAQ AAPL as a customer Does the promise of Zen make AMD more attractive as an acquisition target I doubt that it does for Microsoft The whole semiconductor industry is in the throws of a paradigm shift away from commodity processors fabricated by large scale chip producers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD to custom SOCs produced by companies such as Apple This was initially driven by the need for highly integrated mobile devices but the custom paradigm has been expanding to swallow up ever larger shares of the personal computing market The industry has been adapting to the paradigm shift in a number of ways AMDs own semicustom business represents an adaptation of sorts AMD in effect embraces the custom SOC paradigm and becomes a custom semiconductor house for hire AMDs main problem here has been a lack of presence in the mobile ARM device world There just hasnt been that much demand for semicustom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>compatible chips The other way the industry has been adapting is through consolidation Here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>clearly intends to be the Last Semiconductor Company Standing Microsoft needs semicustom capability for its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture mobile devices tablets and phones but it can expect to get that from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>After Microsofts failed ventures with ARM architecture devices such as Nokia phones and Windows RT tablets Microsoft has been driven back into the arms of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
