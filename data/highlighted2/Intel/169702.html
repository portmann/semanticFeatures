Apple Created The Worlds Fastest Smartphone Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha The new iPhone s and s Plus feature Apples new custom processor the A which may make the s the worlds fastest smartphone The faster A chip translates into enhanced real world capabilities such as K video capture and editing Apple NASDAQ AAPL introduced nextgen iPhones at its September event with the expected improvements a new A system on chip SOC a force measuring screen and a Mpixel camera Rumors had even gotten the new rose gold color and stronger aluminum case alloy correct Were there any surprises Yes Apples A is much faster than the A in the iPhone If Apples performance claims hold up in actual device testing the iPhone s and s Plus will become the worlds fastest smartphones Rumors that had been circulating prior to the September event suggested that iPhone s would feature only incremental improvement in SOC speed for the A Since it was a given that the A would be fabricated on a FinFET process either Samsungs nm or TSMCs nm process all the performance gain could be attributed to the new process The implication was that Apple had done nothing with the previous generation A design other than a die shrink in going from the A nm TSMC process At the September event Phil Schiller more or less confirmed that the A was being fabricated on a new FinFET process which he referred to as a new transistor architecture without being specific about the silicon foundry used No surprise there What was surprising was the claimed performance boost compared to the A for CPU tasks and for graphics processing GPU tasks Apple qualifies the claims by prefacing the numbers with up to so we dont know exactly how fast the new phone will be in specific tests But the claims are consistent with what Apple claimed for the AX in the new iPad Pro CPU improvement compared to the AX in the iPad Air GPU improvement Although Samsungs Galaxy S was released after the iPhone and featured Samsungs core Exynos SOC fabricated on Samsungs nm process the iPhone manages to stay competitive with the Galaxy S in most tests In Geekbench single core tests the iP tests out faster than the Galaxy S while in multicore tests the S is faster In Anandtechs more comprehensive suite of tests the iP was nipping at the heels of the S most of the time If Apples claims are realized the iPhone s will leapfrog the S in performance by almost every measure Why is this important Arent these benchmarks just academic Not really Processor speed affects virtually every aspect of the user experience Since the days of the first Apple computers in the s increases in processor speed have been translated into increased capability and utility The features we now take for granted in mobile devices such as HD video recording and playback are only possible due to the advances in processors since those early days Apples faster A enabled many new capabilities in the iPhone s These include K x video recording and image processing for the new Mpixel camera In addition iPhone s can even edit its own K movies in the iMovie app Apples new d Touch Force Touch by a new name also benefits from the faster processor as does Touch ID D games will also become more detailed and lifelike by virtue of the new processor as demonstrated by PixelToys at the September event The race to build ever faster processors continues to drive innovation at all levels of personal computing Its significant that the fastest smartphones available are made by the two companies that are leading what I have termed the paradigm shift away from commodity processors to custom designed SOCs Apple and Samsung OTC SSNLF I fully expect Samsung to leap frog Apple again when it introduces its next generation of Galaxy devices This competition will continue to drive innovation and serve to differentiate the two companies from their commodity competition Ive been preaching the benefits of custom SOCs and the paradigm shift away from commodity processors in mobile devices for years now so I tend to take it for granted I was interested to read an article about the iPhone s by Farhad Manjoo in the NY Times In the article Manjoo observes that Apple has bucked what he assumes is the dominant trend of commoditization but seems puzzled as to why He concludes the article by assuming that it must be due to Apples superior integration of hardware and software Hes right of course but hes also missing the most important piece of the puzzle If Apple were saddled with using a commodity processor from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Apples ability to create discriminators against its competitors would be severely limited Apple and to a lesser extent Samsung have only been able to occupy the premium tier of the smartphone market by virtue of their custom SOCs Ive chosen to focus on the speed improvements of the new iPhone because they have been largely overlooked by the tech media Following the September event a collective yawn seemed to emanate from the media regarding the incremental improvements of the new iPhone Ever since Apple introduced the first bit SOC in a smartphone in the iPhone s the media have tended to underestimate the importance of Apples faster processors The faster processor combined with features such as D Touch and the new Mpixel camera provides important advantages going in to the all important December quarter My sole disappointment with the s is the lack of any multitasking features available on the iPad Pro Clearly this was a marketing driven decision not a technical one as the s Plus could easily implement multitasking Its probably a measure of Apples confidence in the sales prospects of the s With only about of the iPhone user base converted to iPhone Plus Apple has a lot of room for sales growth Furthermore the discounting of the iPhone Plus should help drive sales Most analysts tended to damn the new iPhone with faint praise following the event For instance Gene Munster an Apple bull predicted yy unit sales growth in fiscal I expect yy iPhone unit growth in the low double digits based on Apples more than incremental improvement of the iPhone s and the availability of discounted iPhone Plus models There may be headwinds in China as Ive discussed previously or the speed improvements may turn out to be less than I expect Apples fiscal Q results reported in October will give investors an opportunity to reset expectations if necessary I expect if anything expectations to be set higher
