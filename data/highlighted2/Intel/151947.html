Alpha IDF as usual will be full of new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>technology announcements Announcements will likely focus on Skylake processors memory D NAND D XPoint Data Center Equipment Mobile SOCs In past years the IDF impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price has been inconsistent The combination of Windows release Data Center growth and Skylake release will likely result in a rise in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price following IDF <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC uses their developer forum in San Francisco to make numerous technical announcements of new products The annual developer forum in AugustSeptember is one of two meetings per year for major <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announcements The other is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Day in November The IDF focuses on technical announcements The Investor Day focuses on technological and financial announcements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>encourages the developer community to adopt new products and develop devices using the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products IDF usually includes announcements of products on the shelves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides some road maps with longer timelines I will be attending the three days and will provide updates in comments to this article as well as new articlesclick to enlarge Overall I expect that the new announcements at IDF to provide an indication of the success that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may have in increasing sales of PCs Data Center equipment memory and mobile SOCs While no specific financial information is provided careful observers can glean information that helps in the prediction of future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales My expectation is that technical announcements will provide the excitement necessary to push PC sales to levels greatly exceeding sales levels in the first half of SKYLAKE This year IDF is about a month earlier than IDF I expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will use this opportunity to further its strategies related to back to school and Christmas sales A focus on new products on shelves over the next couple of months would help boost excitement for these products during this key buying season This excitement will likely focus on Skylake inside with Windows outside Announcements regarding the release of Skylake notebook processors are expected Skylake features such as wireless no passwords and gesture control need to be announced as available now For example Skylake excitement could increase if WCCF Tech is correct that Skylake includes inverse hyperthreading Essentially this would have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>taking virtual technology from the data center and allow all cores in a processor to focus efficiently on one or many tasks This could result in dramatic improvement in performance over only using one core to perform a specific task The flexible scaling of the front end logical core or cores has been inevitable in microarchitecture for a long time We already had the ability for big cores to be broken down into small logical cores so it was only a matter of time before we got the ability to combine big cores into an even bigger logical core At any rate we will learn more about just what exactly is going on underneath the hood at IDF very soon The Skylake nm cores and new architecture are only part of the story Skylake includes in its new chip set Series a myriad of options that will include easier access to wireless features including charging and connections to various screens devices and systems I expect to see new devices by OEMs that make compelling use of the capabilities of Skylake and its chipset These compelling devices will result in increases in sales of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors at high margins MEMORY After the focus on Skylake products hitting the shelves during the next couple of months I expect to hear specifics regarding new memory products based on D NAND and D XPoint This technology has already been jointly announced by Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as part of their joint venture IDF is an opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to announce what products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be producing with this technology Initially I see the focus of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>uses of this new memory technology to be in the data center with uses spreading throughout all platforms over the next couple of years This memory technology associated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>controllers that closely marry with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors will provide a growth market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with high margins DATA CENTER Data Center produces more than of Intels profit and is anticipated to grow per year for the next three years and likely will continue to grow at this rate after with the acquisition of Altera For Data Center I expect to hear more about products that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be making using Altera IP I hope to hear more about Silicon Photonics DC high speed communications that was pulled from production early this year to reengineer I also expect to hear about specific D NAND SSDs for enterprise I expect to hear more about Intels progress in moving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>standard processors into the telecommunications industry to replace custom processors and meet the growing demand for internet data through mobile phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>advances in virtualization and cloud computing will continue to grow DCG sales and margins New memory technology coupled with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors will continue to improve overall performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>systems resulting in more DCG sales growth and higher margins MOBILE It may be a little early for mobile SOC System On a Chip announcements using Skylake and all the mobile IP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has developed over the last couple of years I do expect to hear about progress with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>development of mobile IP In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced that would be a year to build mobile IP Once this mobile IP is complete it will be integrated into a mobile SOC I expect to hear about the value version of this SOC at IDF This focus will likely be on what has been called SOFIA SOFIA is a step toward Intels unstated goal of having a high end mobile phone SOC that also will serve as a personal computing device with similar capability as a current laptop using wireless connections to screens and keyboards I dont expect to hear specifics regarding what I have called a super smart phone but I do expect to hear more about the components of this device These components will include smaller versions of Real Sense cameras for smartphones Microsoft Windows Continuum W adjusts the screen configuration according to the screen being used and not the computing device also two configurations simultaneously SOFIA LTE and Skylake for mobile devices As an example leaked information about a Windows Phone AKA Surface Mobile with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SOC inside will provide a good boost to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mobile sales and reduction in contra revenue the new SOC does not include contra revenue due to the inclusion of various features in the SOC STAY TUNED If the IDF does not result in immediate increases in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price then the technological advancements will provide greater clarity on where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales and margins are heading I see a lot of upside potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>coming out of IDF Unfortunately as described in my previous article I dont see the numerous announcements having much of an impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price without a strong indication that PC sales are growing faster than anticipated Maybe we will get some good news on PC sales at IDF as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>below will soon be a distant memory as the stock moves quickly higher following technological announcements at IDF increases in PC sales during the backtoschoolChristmas seasons and Intels November Investor Day announcements including likely targets for phones in As the IDF program unfolds I will provide updates in comments to this article and try to get articles published from the floor of IDF Disclosure I amwe are long INTC MoreI wrote this article myself and it
