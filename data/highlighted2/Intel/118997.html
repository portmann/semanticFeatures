announced Intels first nm offering wont arrive until late In this article I will first go into a bit of detail about the positives and negatives of Intels NASDAQ INTC Q earnings report and I will then discuss the opportunity on which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>missed out by delaying nm until late Leading up to the Q earnings report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was receiving a lot of flak and many expected the company to underwhelm expectations So it was a pleasant surprise for INTC longs when the company posted betterthanexpected results across all fronts Gross margin of came in ahead of the previously guided number EPS beat by and came in at revenue came in at billion beating by million and the slowdowns experienced in the companys various segments were not as bad as anticipated In addition management guided above consensus revenue estimates for Q and guided a lower drop in fullyear revenue than expected Out of context that is a good thing but there is a lot of context that has to be discussed Before I get into the details I would like to clarify that I thought this was an overall impressive earnings report from the company especially after how much negativity was surrounding the stock leading up to earnings But with that said I still think there are important negative aspects of the report that should be pointed out Do you notice anything fishy about this table In Q compared to Q revenue fell by gross margin fell by two percentage points RD and MGA expenses increased operating income fell and yet EPS for this quarter was exactly the same as it was for Q At first glance this makes no sense but the tax rate tells the story for the quarter This miniscule tax rate is the result of a onetime refund claim and so will not be happening again In addition to the lower tax rate EPS numbers also benefited from million spent on share buybacks during the quarter which reduces the number of shares in the companys float boosting earnings per share I dont view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management in a negative way for the actions taken to boost EPS but I think its important for investors to know how the numbers got to this point It was not due to organic growth Another negative development was Intels decision to cut the capex budget by another billion which is most likely what led to the delay of Intels first nm offering Which brings me to the main focus of this article Moving on from the earnings report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>managements decision to delay nm into late compared to previously expected arrival in late or early is a mistake due to the competitive landscape thats taking shape in the CPU market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has dominated Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD ever since Q a time when both companies were neck and neck in market share The AMD of today is but a shadow of its former self The company has been slow to adapt to new technology and has placed itself firmly in a ditch against the force of nature that is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AMD is being dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the CPU market dominated by Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA in the GPU market and has recently only been successful in supplying APUs for the new generation of gaming consoles which supplies by far the lowest margins But may be the opportunity for which AMD has been hoping GlobalFoundries which fabricates AMDs products reached an agreement with Samsung OTC SSNLF to license its nm technology This will allow AMD to utilize nm for the fabrication of its Zen CPU which is expected to be one of AMDs first offerings in a while that will be able to compete with what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has to offer Zen will likely be going headtohead with a third addition to Intels nm CPU offerings which CEO Brian Krzanich mentioned is code named Kaby Lake This chip will be built on the same foundations of the Skylake architecture Then in late <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will introduce the nm Cannonlake By that point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will have regained the edge if it even loses any market share to AMD and Zen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still the market leader and will almost definitely continue to own that title with ease but by delaying nm to late <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is missing out on a great opportunity to rid themselves of pesky AMD for good By allowing AMD to release a competitive product in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is toying with fate and who knows what will happen when Zen competes with Skylake and Kaby Lake in the second half of AMD is a very financially unhealthy company and many commentators and myself agree that if AMD doesnt pull of a miracle in then the company might be doomed By delaying nm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is throwing AMD a lifeline and giving the company the opportunity to pull off the upset victory over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in It doesnt need to be a fullon coup for AMD to regain some stability and some hope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should crush AMD in with a nm CPU which would effectively eliminate almost all competition AMD is not a company that could survive another year of releasing noncompetitive products and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has missed out on a big opportunity to put its foot on the throat of its rival It remains to be seen whether Zen will measure up to expectations and it also remains to be seen whether it can compete with Kaby Lake But if youre <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>this was the perfect moment to apply pressure on AMD Why risk not doing so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reported good results but missed out on a big opportunity to apply perhaps fatal pressure to AMDs business will now be the first year in a while where AMD has an offering that can compete with Intels products which could potentially lead to AMD gaining market share A nm offering from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could have wiped out AMD indefinitely but now well have to wait and see how the story plays out Disclosure Iwe have no
