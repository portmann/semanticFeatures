be so far behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that it will never catch up AMD still uses an aging nm process while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>produces its own chips with nm FinFET technology The question everyone is asking AMD When will you adopt FinFET and transition to a lower node This question isnt going to go away anytime soon but here I address why the transition is taking so long and give my guess as to when AMD finally transitions In AMD NASDAQ AMD spun off its fabs to alleviate itself from the financial burdens of maintaining such facilities but this forced AMD to rely on the progress of outside manufacturers like TSMC NYSE TSM and GlobalFoundries companies that have far trailed behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC until recently Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recently moved to nm last October TSMC and GlobalFoundries have been ramping up their efforts Global Foundries and Samsung OTCSSNLF have begun ramping their own nm FinFET process for customers as of earlier this month and TSMC debuted its nm planar process back in September with Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone The fabs may have closed the gap against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but AMD doesnt seem to be taking advantage of this as its upcoming APUs Carrizo and CarrizoL will be using the same old nm transistor size that its been using for the last three years This only drags out AMDs biggest wonder as of lately When will it adopt FinFET and transition to a smaller node A special thanks to fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Technology Investing for helping me grasp the topic much better AMD receives its wafers from both Global Foundries and TSMC but almost entirely from the former due to a takeorpay wafer supply agreement These companies have been unsuccessful in keeping up with Intels rapid node shrinks over the years at least until recently TSMC was stuck on nm for two years after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>debuted nm in and only this month has GlobalFoundries replaced its own nm process with a nm FinFET wafer licensed from Samsung When it comes to FinFET TSMC isnt even there yet and Global Foundries latest LPE is basically still a beta for early adopters that cant wait for the more mature faster a better yielding cheaper LPP replacement arriving later this year These delays may have hurt companies like AMD one or two years ago but why now If Apple can receive nm wafers from TSMC from as early as last September why cant AMD receive and utilize this technology for Carrizo and CarrizoL To start Carrizo is out of the question because it is based on AMDs highperformance Bulldozer architecture which isnt suitable for the lowpower nm process However CarrizoL which is based on the lowpower Puma architecture could utilize this process but AMD may not have been able to afford the transition AMD generally has a takeorpay wafer supply agreement with Global Foundries in order to receive a nice fixed price and offloading some supply to TSMCs nm process may affect AMDs ability to produce CarrizoL at the lowest possible cost which is a vital element since these are lowend lowmargins parts Global Foundries just started shipping LPE which I suspect is more than suitable for Carrizo however it is probably just as uneconomical As mentioned before LPE is far from perfect and the costs are currently high Furthermore AMD is using its Bulldozer architecture to target midrange laptops which are also lowmargin chips that make it difficult for AMD to achieve value through the new technology If these were highperformance highmargin parts used to replace AMDs old FX chips this could be possible but the latest Bulldozer design is emphasized for laptops Above watts as seen in the image below the part starts to consume more energy than its predecessor Kaveri making it unviable for desktops Theres just no way that AMD can compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the highend without a whole new architecture AMD has repeatedly stated that theres much room to grow on the nm process and this has been true with what weve seen so far Both AMD and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA have been stuck with nm except that Nvidia is known to be moving to TSMCs FF technology next year While on nm we have seen examples of performance and power consumption improvements made on a design level rather than through a traditional node shrink With Nvidias latest Maxwell architecture we saw an enormous unpredictable leap forward in power efficiency while using the same nm process Many are suspecting that AMD will replicate this achievement with its upcoming series GPUs Even with AMDs upcoming Carrizo and CarrizoL technologies AMD explained that its new HighDensity Library design with Excavator the latest Bulldozer version is smaller and uses less power while on the same node AMD is able to fill this space with more GPU horsepower and also noted that Carrizo is a very big leap forward in terms of power consumption AMD is in a very tight spot with very very little wiggle room To manage its cost and stay afloat the company has lowered RD and dramatically cut the line of products it is working on In the PC space its gone from covering everything from encompassing highend desktops to tablets to covering merely lowtomid range laptops AMDs Bulldozer failure is largely to blame for this and AMD doesnt have a replacement for this architecture until Until then AMD has been resorting to tactics that will allow it to stay afloat and generate some cash This is the big risk regarding AMDs future but many including myself are highly optimistic about the upcoming architectures Zen and K We cant tell for sure but should AMD succeed it will dramatically improve its flexibility which will allow it to finally adopt better transistor technologies This will likely be the case and if so I suspect that AMD will debut its Zen and K processors with GlobalFoundries LPP process that will launch later this year Source When Will AMDs Technology Process Catch Up To Intels Disclosure The author
