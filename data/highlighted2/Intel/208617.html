NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now allegedly has people working to integrate the XMM LTE modem inside a future iPhone VentureBeat also said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might win a foundry manufacturing deal for an Apple Aseries SoC using its nm process I already made it clear in August that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC could have notable economic benefits if Apple NASDAQ AAPL would use the XMM LTE modem inside some of its nextgeneration iPhones A recent news item from Seeking Alpha again informed me this morning that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now has people working hard to fit the XMM LTE modem inside an iPhone slated for release next year This latest report should now convince more people that Apple is really very interested in using the XMM Yes it was previously hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to land a modem supply deal with Apple because Intels older modems are not compatible with CDMA I was wrong and no XMM was used inside the iPhone s and iPhone s Plus However the newer much better <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>XMM LTE modem might just find its way inside iPhones next year The Intelmade XMM is a Cat LTE Advanced modem that supports x carrier aggregation It can do up to Mbps download speed The iPhone s is still using only a Cat LTE Advanced Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM MDM modem which reportedly only has Mbps top download speed Since Apple will allegedly use Intelmade modems for iPhones intended for emerging markets it doesnt bother me at all if these modems will not find their way inside iPhones intended for sale in America My point is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt really need to go crazy in trying to make its LTE modems work with CDMA EVDO standard of some US carriers The iPhone business is not limited to the US market My understanding is that Apple will allegedly doublesource its modem needs from Qualcomm and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Apple can sell its Qualcomm modemequipped CDMAfriendly iPhones in the US and the Intelequipped ones in other foreign markets Aside from the obvious economic benefits from putting the XMM inside an iPhone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>urgently needs a substantial deal with Apple to help it improve its reputation among retail investors and hedge fund managers Apple is still the best outfit when it comes to selling highmargin luxury smartphones Having a product inside an iPhone is a major PR coup As of now only Asustek OTCASUUY is aggressively using an Intelmade processordiscreet LTE modem combo for Android phones Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT again ignored the XMM Atom x and x for its latest Lumia Windows phones Apples brand power also moves more iPhones than Asustek could ever achieve Getting half or even just a quarter of the annual LTE modem supply needs of the iPhone is already a blockbuster win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The LTE modembaseband processors is a huge part of the Bill of Materials of the iPhone s Tech Insights lumped the cost of the LTE modem with the processor but as we can see from the charts below the LTE modembaseband processors could comprise of an iPhones total BOM If we estimate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might supply million LTE modems to iPhones next year and we use a contract price per unit XMM we could say this supply deal could be worth million Of course the million unit estimate is rather conservative since Apple could actually sell more than million iPhones per year A source of VentureBeat is also saying that Apple is requesting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to possibly manufacture a systemonchip SoC that integrates an Intelmade LTE modem inside an Aseries processor The alleged deal entails Apple designing the said SoC under its own brand name and will only license the LTE modem IP from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>VentureBeats source also said Apple is allegedly interested in Intels largescale nanometer chip manufacturing process which is believed to be superior to Samsung OTCSSNLF and TSMCs NYSE TSM foundry capabilities Apple is also allegedly very interested in Intels upcoming nanometer process which is coming in It remains to be seen if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be willing to license its XMM product for Apple to customize However winning a fabrication deal for Apples nextgeneration chips is another major tailwind for the company Like I said earlier Apple is still the bestselling vendor when it comes to pricey phones and tablets Partnering with it could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reduce its huge operating losses on mobile chips The persistent rumor that Apple is negotiating with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to use its LTE modem for some iPhone models is one more reason why we should all stay long INTC Before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought it Infineon modemsbaseband processors were used inside earlier models of the iPhone You could explain this recent rumor from VentureBeat by surmizing that Apple only wants more customization control over the modemsconnectivity components of its iPhone product I have no basis but I speculate Qualcomm probably rejected Apples request and Tim Cook is now trying to negotiate a similar modem IP licensing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I hope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will consider acceding to the request of Apple to get full design rights over the alleged LTE modemA processor SoC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could then demand in return that Apple should give it an exclusive chip manufacturing deal in exchange for licensing the LTE modem technology Sad but true <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs Apple more than Apple needs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Rejecting Apples alleged request for customization of its chip design might drive the iPhone maker to find alternative partners for its upcoming LTEembedded Aseries processor INTC is a buy I know the stock has breached the price level but I still believe it has a lot more room to fly higher The alliance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Apple might not remain exclusive to Mac computers a mobile chip partnership is also highly
