style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced clarified strategies that focus on growth areas The stock price however will likely be driven by the decline areas greater declines than anticipated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been saying for a long time that data center IoT and memory are growth areas Recently they added FPGAs Now they are adding G connectivity The net impact on next quarter this year and subsequent years is extremely difficult to estimate due to many moving parts Ill focus on changes to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has guided <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has recently given us a lot to chew on and digest first quarter earnings restructuring strategies product deaths and revised guidance In their statements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>describes the basis of their guidance Focus in this article will be on the areas that will likely be different than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is expecting This will be a big picture look Growth areas in PCs are ins and gaming PCs Also the light and thin laptops are growing along with set top boxes These growth areas are nice but not enough to turn PC sales into a positive growth area High single digit declines in PC sales are expected by Intels CFO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has consistently under estimated PC sales declines I think PC sales will decline more than high single digits The CEO went so far as to defend their poor track record of estimating PC sales declines to say that Intels PC sales estimates are lower than industry estimates maybe Gartner and IDC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must make strong progress toward Pocket PCs These devices could become a future growth area for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Pocket PCs must be able to multitask complex programs They must dock wirelessly to keyboards and larger multiple screens Pocket PCs also will be used as phones To accomplish these necessary features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must integrate G technology into a nm processor along with memory Reaching a Pocket PC with G integrated into the silicon will take several years If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>misses this opportunity someone will do this ARM the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as we know it will be uncertain Intels CEO after providing a nice explanation for the head of IoT leaving explained curtly that Kirk Skaugan err ahh err ahh left for other opportunities That was it BKs stumbling speak indicates a high level of discomfort Nothing about what Kirk accomplished Truth is that Kirk was supposed to keep PC sales flat or rising and he failed to perform He had lots of good ideas wireless docking now passwords natural gesture interface Real Sense wireless charging None of these ever took hold The tech did not advance as promised and the market did not respond to the meager tech that was implemented Many of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>job cuts are likely in the PC arena especially outside of gaming and the lightthin applications Intels CFO said that customers are burning off excess inventory He said this is happening in the first half of and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does not expect burning of inventories in the second half my words The reason for excess inventories is lower PC sales If sales were flat or growing there would be less need to burn off excess inventories PC sales are continuing to decline and I think excess inventories will continue to drag PC sales On the positive side of PC sales the market is still huge even if it is shrinking Also the CFO clearly stated several times that lower nm costs are helping increase profits from expectations in and gaming sales are strong Light and thin is a positive Sales would be declining double digits if not for these growth areas Mobile small and negative portion of CCG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>says it is reducing losses in this area by at least million Management hints that the reduction will likely be greater than million Ceasing work on Sofia and Broxton will help reduce mobile losses Mobile is a huge and necessary investment in the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Both the data center growth and PC sales require huge steps forward in mobility To be effective in the cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must have endtoend expertise from the cloud all the way down to mobile PCs mobile phones and mobile IoT devices To be effective in the telcom industry with Network Function Virtualization mobile expertise is even more critical PCs are becoming more and more mobile Pocket PCs Without a huge investment in mobile connectivity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would be left behind in the dust Intels leadership in G is a great opportunity if they can deliver Leadership in accelerating G will be huge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>connectivity and making all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products more mobile G results will take several years Intels CEO emphatically stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mobile absolutely continuing to grow Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>be able to turn around by refocusing and becoming even more mobile as demanded by the general industry direction Cloud the largest growing part of the Data Center Group The cloud is still growing but not as fast as the last couple of years Intels CFO talked about doubledigit growth in DCG We are likely near the peak in CPU sales for the cloud The cloud will continue to require more processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has taken steps to continue making the cloud a growth area by expanding they types of devices it sells into the cloud to include storage and communications This expansion is helping Intels approach is to provide the best performance from the top to the bottom of the cloud rack <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sees this whole rack approach as unique no other company can provide entire endtoend solutions in the cloud Intels CFO was careful to explain that the overall decline in DCG Average Selling Price was due to the mix He explained that ASPs for every segment within the cloud business grew The overall reduction in ASP was due to desirable growth in networking where the ASP is lower hundreds of dollars compared to thousands for CPUs Networking sales in the cloud grew YOY Diane Bryants recent promotion to Executive Vice President highlights the importance of growth in DCG and Dianes success in this area This appears to put Diane in the top four at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO CFO President and Executive Vice President Negatives include niche competition from ARM and Power I see these as niche products pursued by the industry to fill small niche needs and keep <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>prices under control If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can continue to increase performance and continue to grow the overall data center endtoend solution approach then the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>moat in the data center will continue Enterprise Servers the declining part of the DCG This area includes server sales that are declining as more and more companies move to the cloud Intels CFO talked about ongoing softness in enterprise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has consistently underestimated the declines in this area I think they have once again underestimated the sales decline in traditional servers Servers are still being sold and they still produce good profits but the sales are declining as companies rely more heavily on the cloud and as they do not need to replace or upgrade their servers due to longer lasting devices and growing use of the cloud for compute heavy tasks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does not talk much about these declines but investors should watch this area carefully along with declining PC sales Declines that are greater than anticipated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will negatively affect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>EPS NFV the biggest opportunity for growth in the DCG Not much new news here This lack of news could be that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some big announcements coming up or it could mean that things are not going as well as anticipated in this area I will be watching this area closely The TAM in this area is over billion and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>currently has less than billion in this arena Lots of potential here Again not much news here The CEO did repeat that Intels focus in IoT is on autonomous vehicles see below industrial and retail G is seen as critical to growth in IoT To me that says that IoT growth to meaningful dollar amounts is still several years away As if to reinforce this Intels CEO pointed out that a product win in will translate to increased salesprofits in Good growth potential This is an area where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made lots of investments recently Drones have been a key part of this strategy Intels approach is to take tech developed for one area drones in this case and integrate it into other areas These other areas could be all manner of vehicles Think cars and trucks for very large quantities Intels Real Sense tech is helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>enter the autonomous vehicle arena Last quarter saw a big decline in memory earnings due to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investments D XPoint and the China D NAND plant and low pricing caused by aggressive pricing by Samsung <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did not mention names but Samsung is the low cost leader right now The majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>D NAND is now going into data center SSDs where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>enjoys a great reputation for six nines of reliability and for having controllers that maximize the performance associated with using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SSDtogether with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors Sales volumes continue to grow When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>becomes a cost leader with D NAND from its China plant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>profits from memory will grow significantly Lower pricing of SSDs will result in larger sales to meet growing cloud demand increase in demand and moving away from spinning disks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to talk about the D NAND cost advantage and said that with D NAND they will enjoy more profits even during times like these D XPoint is a great invention but significant sales and profits are most likely not until due to product development and adoption timing D XPoint requires new and complicated code and integration to make beneficial use of the capabilities of the tech This takes time In the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings report conference call and other statements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides general information about the basis for their earnings guidance In recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price has mostly been driven by changes in earnings per share and overall sales volume Other announcements have an impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price but without earnings and sales growth these announcements of new technology have minor impact on the stock price The combination of new technology announcements and earningssales growth have a dramatic impact on stock price even if the new technology announcements and the earningssales growth are not connected In the growth in stock price was due to a combination of earningssales growth due primarily to PC refreshes associated with a Windows OS end of support and new technology announcements associated with data center tablets PC enhancements and mobile SOCs these areas were actually a drag on profits at the time due to development costs According to Intels recent restructuring announcement While making the company more efficient <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>plans to increase investments in the products and technologies that will fuel revenue growth and drive more profitable mobile and PC businesses Through this comprehensive initiative the company plans to increase investments in its data center IoT memory and connectivity businesses as well as growing client segments such as ins gaming and home gateways Conclusions Related to Overall Earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does a decent job of providing quarterly and annual guidance Timing of investments in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to consider when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>deviates from their guidance Such deviations from guidance are what drives changes in the stock price up or down Lets look at a few deviations from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guidance JuneJuly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to revise upward their guidance due to increases in PC sales due to stronger than anticipated sales due to Microsofts discontinuance of support for an older version of Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock soared MarchApril <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to revise guidance downward due to lower than anticipated sales of PCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock tanked MarchApril <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to lower its guidance again I see the main reasons as primarily weaker than anticipated sales of PCs and weaker than anticipated sales of traditional servers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock propped up temporarily by restructuring and workforce reduction announcements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CFO talks a lot about forecasting When one forecasts PC and server sales one looks at what has happened in the past and adjusts What we see happening in PC and server sales has never happened before so adjustments are difficult for accounting types <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making adjustments to adjustments in these areas while they try to remain optimistic Sales in PCs other than a few areas are falling faster than they have historically This drop will continue as more and more people use their smartphones for daytoday tasks Work PCs are lasting longer and benefits associated with new PC purchases are not compelling enough to upgrade in huge numbers Traditional server sales are dropping as cloud use grows and older servers continue to function at acceptable levels The place to watch for impacts to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings are PC sales and traditional sever sales being weaker than anticipated Intels second quarter earnings will be weaker than anticipated due to lower than anticipated PC sales and lower than anticipated traditional server sales Other areas impacting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guidance will pretty much be as anticipated Worse than anticipated declines in PC and traditional server sales will drive EPS and stock lower over the next quarter or two <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock is headed to or even over the next few months For more details
