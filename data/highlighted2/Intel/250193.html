Accurate Breakdown Of Apple iPhone Costs Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Mark Hibben incorrectly believes that cost breakdowns are only inclusive of hardware costs Thats not the case whatsoever and while bill of materials is not enough to deduce the cost of an iPhone in isolation it gives us a great starting point We can find the remaining costs of an iPhone using accounting and mathematics more specifically Algebra After doing my own due diligence I believe the iPhone segment generates a gross margin Furthermore I believe the valuation seems stretched as were going through the trough parts of a device cycle and currency impact limits sales upside Therefore Im initiating a sell recommendation From my perspective I find it interesting that Mark Hibben would continue to assert his stance on Apple NASDAQ AAPL sales while theres enough evidence to the contrary that Apple wont generate the same kind of unit demandgrowth weve seen in recent years While I can acknowledge that these figures from the bill of materials arent allencompassing on their own they give us a starting point from which we can deduce the remaining costs of an iPhone Needless to say I feel like the risktoreward is not compelling at these levels The stock is in the beginning stages of forming another downtrend As such it may be time to reassess the risktoreward as there are many other opportunities that carry more upside with much less downside Im going to clarify my cautious stance in this article and Im going to break out the remaining iPhone costs so its logically consistent In a sense the two companies Apple and Foxconn OTCFXCOF are linked because if Foxconns cost per unit goes up so does their bill of materials This also favorably impacts revenue As such I believe that Foxconns sales growth was mostly generated by a pricing improvement in the case of Apple handsets In the case of Android handsets the pricing dropped but volume continued to grow as indicated by thirdparty smartphone forecasts On balance Foxconn grew sales due to component costs increasing and not as a result of handset volumes If there was volume growth it was mostly driven by lowend Android handsets Mark Hibben questions the integrity of channelbased analysts By the way Ive talked to real expert consultants within the semiconductor space and the way they deduce cost is by taking real order invoices and matching them up with handsets In other words these data points can be interpreted as being derived from real world invoices therefore I wouldnt be so sure that these figures are made up Furthermore Ive had numerous conversations with the individual and its possible to gain access to this type of data but you have to pay thousands per year to maintain subscription fees Either IHS is just a facilitator of the research or they check directly into the order figures to understand the costs but in a sense theres no questioning these figures are relatively accurate once you start breaking down the remaining cost drivers Im going to directly refute Marks comments from his prior article The cost estimate that Cho cites is just one of many that are produced from outfits such as IHS and Techinsights These sites typically come up with iPhone manufacturing costs that are in the range Despite Cooks admonishment the cost estimates continue to be produced and continue to fall in roughly the same range What are the problems with the estimates The most obvious problem is that the gross margin for the iPhone would exceed If that were the case and given that more than of Apples revenue typically comes from the iPhone Apples corporate gross margin would probably be much higher Mark Hibben Hes mentioning the logical consistency in which these estimates are figured into Apples actual consolidated COGS which they report on a quarterly basis From my perspective what hes presenting isnt an argument but an appeal to authority with his reference to Tim Cook as he hasnt pieced together the remaining components of COGS An article going back a couple years from Digital Trends tries to break down the costs to the operating profit level Im going to get rid of the overlapping OpEx factors and work my way up to the actual gross margins Apple doesnt recognize its revenue at the retail price point but rather the wholesale price point Digital Trends estimate this cost to be but its actually a little less than that when based on a percentile basis and handset distribution model from UBS I figure the wholesale to retail markup averages around on a consolidated basis So Apples actual net revenue on a handset is closer to The bill of materials on the base handset was for iPhone s So if we deduct from the we arrive at a gross margin figure And yes thats way too high indeed So I turn over to an accounting reference from Stanford when pertaining to the treatment of cost capitalization when pertaining to software development which is the accounting thats used by both Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Apple to articulate the cost of revenue for software alone Yes Ive verified that these methods are put to use by both companies by reviewing the accounting notes from Microsofts and Apples annual reports The problem with bill of materials data is that they pertain only to the cost of manufacturing a handset and the component costs They dont offer any additional insight beyond that but if Apple had not kept its cost of manufacturing down its probable that the gross margin figure would have worsened over the years In fact I believe Apple wasnt able to increase gross margin outlook precisely because material cost inputs increased There are three main stages of computer software development These stages are defined as the preliminary project stage the application development stage and the postimplementation operation stage Only costs included in the application development stage are eligible for capitalization Capitalization of costs begins once management authorizes and commits funding and the preliminary project stage is completed Capitalization should cease when all testing is substantially completed and software is ready for intended use or it becomes unlikely that the project will be completed Once management authorizes and commits funding and the preliminary project stage is completed Design of selected software including software configuration and software interface Coding Installation of software Quality assurance testing iOS is a fairly expensive platform to maintain which drives up the iPhone cost The cost of software development gets capitalized on a straightline basis for each iPhone unit sold which impacts cost of revenue However Apple estimates these costs pertaining to the development of software on a per unit basis which is why the ongoing development of new versions is also figured into the cost per handset The cost of providing software updates is estimated but reflected in each handset on a quarterbyquarter basis There are other costs such as warranty projected product returns and servicing devices like when you call Apples helpline that go into the cost of revenue figure for Apple This is why Tim Cook says that the bill of materials alone is not sufficient for understanding Apples gross margin figure And to that effect hes telling the honest truth According to Apples Form K For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone iPad and iPod touch iOS devices Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software andor nonsoftware services free of charge The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices The first deliverable which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the products essential software The third deliverable is the nonsoftware services to be provided to qualifying devices The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method page Apple then goes on to state when pertaining to software development costs Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers page They repeated the general treatment of software capitalization that was mentioned by Stanford earlier in the article This means that Apples actual RD when pertaining to software is substantially higher than what the RD indicates This is because the cost pertaining to the development stage is whats being capitalized into the cost of goods sold figure As such Apples development of software is whats resulting in a much lower gross margin figure than what was indicated by just the bill of materials or retail markup in isolation After doing a lot of Algebra and digging into various research papers pertaining to PC failures rates and handset manufacturing cost my gross margin is The remaining segments drag that margin figure down I feel confident that supply chain details when pertaining to Foxconn are a negative indicator and not refutable based on claims of credibility With component costs increasing from the prior year model Apple will struggle to mitigate some margin contraction Furthermore I cant imagine how Foxconns figures are confirming of strength in handsets The October numbers are pretty revealing because thats when production ramped and sellin was at its highest for CY I believe that if Foxconns next month sales were to weaken even further we can understand the degree of softness in iPhone sales for QFY Im fairly certain that after reading this article investors can agree that these manufacturing costs can be rationalized into Apples consolidated income statement I have also checked in with other sellside sources and they also believe that gross margins for just the iPhone alone are in the upper percentile range Furthermore I believe that Apples valuation trades roughly in line with peers like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ I think that the market is valuing Apple roughly the way it values other companies who are dependent on a recurring hardware cycle Most of Apples revenue is derived from selling hardware not software While Apple does have a software business it doesnt compose a meaningful percentage of sales roughly of sales As such Apples business model is more hardware dependent and operates on a cyclical dynamic This dynamic is driven by device refresh which will require a strong product launch in the iPhone generation to lift sales in FY While theres repeatability of business you could also argue the same for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and HewlettPackard However for more mature device categories theres the possibility that device refresh can become more elongated Therefore Apple needs to deliver a stellar product in their upcoming device otherwise it will be a soso year for Apple consumers and investors Given the weakening dynamic of sales and FX headwinds I anticipate sales will decline by this year I dont anticipate a smaller variation of the handset to offset weakness in consumer spending And while the device will appeal to some handset owners I see no reason to anticipate that it will offset currency headwinds In other words if youve witnessed how investors have reacted to quarterly disappointments now is probably the opportunity to get out and reassess other alternatives Theres no denying currency is a subjective argument but in the past Apple has used currency impact to report stronger sales Therefore Apple cant use constant currency adjustments to inflate sales growth in the upcoming year This seems fair and while the companys fundamentals arent completely broken the valuation could trend even lower as indicated by the price chart Im initiating a sell recommendation and lowering my price target from to times earnings I imagine further downside from here and while Im open to the idea of changing my stance Id need to see the stock price come down further and a build up of anticipation for iPhone to justify both a higher valuation and stronger earningssales We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We
