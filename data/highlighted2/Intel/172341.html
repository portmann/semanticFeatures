class='textDiv'>Altera Arbitrage Opportunity Still Has Value Altera Corporation NASDAQALTR Seeking Alpha annualized return if the deal closes by April US regulatory hurdle was easy EU likely the same China the only small question mark Risk of deal failure is incredibly small but could open up some heavy downside on shares Worth the gamble if sized appropriately Mergerarbitrage is something I dont normally dig into too deeply for investment ideas Such events are a playground for hedge funds and other big money players with far more time knowledge and resources than I have In the markets I find that retail investors often have much better luck finding alpha in undercovered or underappreciated smaller names rather than chasing returns in highprofile MA These deals generally have the riskreward priced close to inline when I run the numbers Every once in a while however the market misprices the risk involved in one of these deals and an opportunity for profit arises Intels NASDAQ INTC purchase of Altera NASDAQ ALTR is one of those cases The agreement was for a purchase price of share in cash valuing Altera at approximately B Cautious value investors note that the deal at x ttm EBITDA is more expensive than comparable deals in the semiconductor space Avago NASDAQ AVGO buying Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM NXP Semiconductors NASDAQ NXPI buying Freescale Semiconductor NYSE FSL However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still forecasts the deal to be accretive to earnings per share and to close quickly after only six to nine months I think that the deal is a winwin for both sides Altera shareholders get a solid premium on shares that have traded below their fair value for some time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gets an immediate foothold to become the number two player in the programmable logic devices PLD market within firing distance of number one player Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX Xilinx shareholders have been heading for the exit since the deal was announced with shares down nearly based on fears of what the IntelAltera union means for their market share Such fears are justified The new joint company will likely have significant synergies to allow operational expense reductions feeding already strong margins and Intels leadershipcrossselling will yield significant benefits to improve the already strong Altera product portfolio Alteras product market is forecast to grow in the midhigh single digits for the next ten years which could make this an acquisition that contributes B in revenue by This will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>move the needle on topline growth which has been stagnant since One caveat is that only approximately B of Intels current cash pile is available for use in the United States without incurring additional US income tax penalties so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will need to raise significant debt to fund the purchase This wont be a problem given the hot corporate debt market deals to raise the cash have already begun <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>raised B late in July Demand was strong with significant investor interest helping price the debt favorably The deal breezed through United States regulatory approval in early September with the Department of Justice not requesting any additional information The European Union ruling by October th and China remain the big obstacles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Altera do not compete directly with each other but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does provide products to some of Alteras current competitors This has driven antitrust worries in the market likely feeding the disconnect in the current deal spread I dont expect a review from the European Union but China may drag its feet China is currently the worlds largest consumer of semiconductor chips and also the location of quite a few foundries from SMIC to SK Hynix so regulators there might field some inquiries to take a closer look at the acquisition However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been the largest semiconductor supplier to China for several years and has built significant relationships with the Chinese government and regulators I dont believe that Intels management would have entered into this deal and set the six to nine month timeframe and made the comments that they have without significant assurance that the deal will be successful With Altera at share about spread remains Assuming that the deal closes by March which is on the highend of management guidance you can earn in annual returns with two Altera dividends going exdividend in NovemberFebruary as a little extra incentive The risk here is the premium <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is paying If the deal fails Altera will likely fall dramatically The current offer of share is a significant premium to Alteras prior trading range which had been rangebound around share for the past several years The chart below illustrates my views on the risk involved in the Altera deal I think the market currently reflects an chance that the deal will go through at current share price levels with the chances of closing in January or March split evenly The risk reflects the possible massive downside of the deal failing which would likely cause Altera to fall back to share If you think that this is a fair reflection then youve got nothing to gain here However I think that a chance of failure is rather high at this point Even just a small change in your perception of that failure drastically changes the potential earnings profile given my estimates of a chance of deal failure Given the spread the IntelAltera deal presents an opportunity for retail investors to have a high probability win Other SeekingAlpha contributors like Chris DeMuth Jr have been pounding the drum on this opportunity as well urging retail investors to at least give the potential opportunity a look I echo those sentiments This is likely a core position on many big money arbitrage desks given the liquidity involved in the deal and it is a wonder that the spread has not tightened farther For investors new to eventdriven strategy this deal will be highly transparent and easy to follow However the impact of a negative ruling could have a significant downside so the size of your position in relation to your overall portfolio should be determined appropriately weight for me currently Happy trading Disclosure I amwe
