has agreed to be acquired by Western Digital for billion Apple is very unlikely to come out with a bigger bid for SanDisk that would potentially destroy its relationships with the DRAM manufacturers Western Digital is going to be very highly leveraged after the SanDisk deal Seagate would have to be even more highly leveraged if it acquires SanDisk Micron SK Hynix Samsung Seagate and Apple are all unlikely to make a big bid to spoil Western Digitals party Western Digital NASDAQ WDC has agreed to acquire SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK for billion Assuming Western Digitals previous arrangement with Chinas Unisplendour goes through as expected almost all of SanDisks payment will be received in cash Leading up to the Western DigitalSanDisk deal the rumor mill produced several potential acquirers of SanDisk other than Western Digital These names included Micron NASDAQ MU Seagate NASDAQ STX Samsung OTCSSNLF and SK Hynix OTCHXSCF According to Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan there is a chance that one of these other companies will come out with a bigger bid for SanDisk There was also another rumor started by B Riley analyst Craig Ellis that stated Apple NASDAQ AAPL could also be interested in acquiring the biggest pure play nonvolatile memory company in the world While it isnt impossible that someone tries to spoil Western Digitals plans I believe the odds of a bigger bid for SanDisk are much closer to than MA activity in the semiconductor industry has reached a frenzied pace in Avago NASDAQ AVGO NXP Semiconductors NASDAQ NXPI Freescale NYSE FSL Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM Altera NASDAQ ALTR <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and many others have been involved in major MA deals already this year PMCSierra NASDAQ PMCS finds itself in a bidding war between Microsemi Corporation NASDAQ MSCC and Skyworks NASDAQ SWKS I just dont see a similar bidding war emerging for SanDisk Micron and Western Digital were rumored to be in discussions to acquire SanDisk for the last few weeks While a Micron acquisition of SanDisk would eliminate a member of the NAND oligopoly and bring about a higher concentration of power in the industry Microns main benefit from acquiring SanDisk would be SanDisks joint fab capacity that it shares with Toshiba SanDisk would get to abandon its effort with HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ to jointly develop a next generation NVM nonvolatile memory that will try to match the performance characteristics of Micron and Intels D XPoint A MicronSanDisk combination could also abandon the expensive effort to roll out SanDisks BiCS Assuming a deal is mostly financed in cash Micron would also likely see a shortterm boost in earnings and free cash flow While SanDisks fab capacity would be nice to have for Micron SanDisks IP intellectual property is unlikely to be of significant value to Micron Micron seems to be pleased with its D NAND solution and D XPoint which would indicate that the Idahobased memory giant would likely just scrap SanDisks RD efforts in D NAND and next generation NVM SanDisks planar NAND has significantly better cost per bit metrics than that of Microns planar NAND but the era of D NAND is quickly approaching Micron is set to leapfrog SanDisk as well as SK Hynix and Samsung to reach the top of the list of companies in terms of cost per bit for NAND by the end of or early On top of the lack of significant value that Micron sees in SanDisks IP Micron would also likely have to deal with the objections of regulatory agencies in the US DOJ and FTC and abroad which would add delays and additional costs that a Western DigitalSanDisk tie up may be able to avoid SanDisk shares fabs with Toshiba and it seems highly unlikely that Micron would be willing to share its D NAND and D XPoint architecture with rival Toshiba It also seems unlikely that Toshiba would want to share its IP with Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>too The only way to avoid this would be either Micron or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also acquiring Toshiba concurrently with a MicronSanDisk merger A MicronSanDisk merger would already be complicated as is Another deal with Toshiba would just compound the difficulties of getting a deal through for financial technological and regulatory reasons Western Digital highly values SanDisks IP and fab capacity With Micron subtracting out the value of SanDisks IP adding costs related to delays resulting from regulatory activity adding a premium relative to Western Digitals big bid and potentially lowering future gross margins due to sharing IP with Toshiba Micron would have to value SanDisks fab capacity at significantly more than billion There is also the sticky issue of having to get Toshiba and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to not vehemently protest which seems unlikely to me As a result I believe there is close to no chance that Micron will present a bid that is better than what Western Digital has offered Samsung made a billion bid for SanDisk in and subsequently pulled the offer Unlike Micron theres a chance that Samsung can find value in both SanDisks fabs and IP Currently Samsung is paying royalties to SanDisk for use of SanDisks NAND patents This cost could be eliminated with a SanDisk acquisition Samsung is likely experiencing significant problems with its D NAND product that it has been shipping for over a year already In the event that Samsung cannot cost effectively fix their issues with VNAND the Korean electronics giant could scrap its D NAND architecture and join SanDisk and Toshiba with BiCS On the RD side it is highly probable that both Samsung and SanDisk are both hard at work on trying to find a response to Micron and Intels D XPoint as soon as possible By merging the two NAND giants could focus their collective efforts on one next generation NVM architecture which could lead to both shortening the time it takes to develop a next generation NVM as well as a potential huge cost savings of not having to run two separate development efforts For unknown reasons the bid from Samsung for SanDisk appeared to have led to minimal dialogue between the two Samsung pulled its offer because of SanDisks refusal to entertain friendly discussions SanDisk stated that it was Samsung who was uninterested to begin discussions on a possible merger SanDisk also stated We believe this raises questions about the real motivation behind Samsungs offer Whatever prevented even holding discussions in seems to present the possibility that a repeat in could occur even if Samsung and SanDisk were interested in a possible deal The regulatory issues a MicronSanDisk deal would have would only be magnified for a possible SamsungSanDisk merger While a SamsungSanDisk deal offers more synergistic value than a MicronSanDisk deal the odds of a big Samsung offer for SanDisk now seem remote at best An SK Hynix deal for SanDisk makes a lot more sense than a Samsung or Micron bid Hynix has the weakest position in NAND of the major manufacturers and SanDisk currently has the strongest Since SanDisk does not produce DRAM and Hynix is one of the big three in manufacturing DRAM a single entity consisting of SK Hynix and SanDisk could make a very costcompetitive MCP Multi Chip Package consisting of mobile DRAM and NAND for the smartphone market Seventy percent of mobile phones will have MCPs this year As separate entities SK Hynix and SanDisk would face significant risk of not being able to produce competitivelypriced MCPs once Micron ramps up production of its low cost D NAND Hynixs ability to scrap its own D NAND and next generation NVM development in favor of SanDisks current NVM architectures would present significant cost savings Risk of regulatory interference exists but it is significantly less than that of potential bids from Micron or Samsung In the comments section of my previous article SanDisk The Acquisition Target the issue of Toshiba SanDisks fab partner in producing NAND having trouble working with a Korean company was thoroughly discussed While JapaneseKorean relations may not be ideal I do not think it would be a major issue that would prevent a deal so long as the financial terms of the deal makes sense for everyone involved While I see an SK Hynix bid as far more likely than a Samsung or Micron bid it is hard to fathom the possibility of SK Hynix putting in an offer higher than billion Seagate would love nothing more than to drive up the price of SanDisk for Western Digital Western Digital is going to become very highly leveraged if it must pay close to billion in cash to close the deal The combined Western DigitalSanDisk would create a company that initially has a negative tangible book value after Western Digital borrows up to billion to finance this transaction Seagate is already a more highly levered firm than Western Digital and it seems unlikely that Seagate would be willing to become as insanely highly levered as it would have to be to create a compelling offer for SanDisk shareholders Seagate would get the same benefits as Western Digital would with an acquisition of a giant NAND manufacturer an ability to transition to a major SSD manufacturer in the postHDD era whenever that happens However a bid in excess of billion would be difficult to pull off Western Digital has a cleaner balance sheet than Seagate and also has a Chinese friend that may potentially be involved in financing the bid for SanDisk Seagate does not have that luxury and will likely be unable to offer a significant premium over the mostly cash bid from its longtime archrival There are some potential benefits for Apple if it is able to successfully acquire SanDisk The memory industry is cyclical and prices of NAND can and will fluctuate significantly over time While predicting the costs of producing NAND is fairly easy to do for a NAND producer estimating the trajectory of the price per GB of NAND has been extremely difficult for everyone As a result of a SanDisk acquisition Apple could get some cost certainty and more importantly supply guarantee in a critical storage component in its iPhone iPad and whatever electronic devices that the company will dream up in the future The above chart represents SanDisks revenues by segment The numbers dont add up to always due to rounding These numbers were pulled directly from SanDisks quarterly filing in July It becomes pretty obvious that SanDisks mix of end market demand for its NAND does not even remotely resemble the mix of end markets of Apple products that require NAND It is important to note NAND is not just one type of memory product There are actually several subcategories of products under the NAND umbrella including SLC MLC and TLC as well as modifications to that NAND to suit the various end products the memory dies will end up in USB flash drives memory cards SSDs etc While close to all of SanDisks revenue comes from selling NAND if you ignore royalties this revenue is actually derived from many separate products that are not interchangeable Certainly Apple could modify the mix of SanDisks output to more closely match the needs of its iDevices That will take time However it is inevitable that Apple will have to continue selling NANDbased products to other electronics companies as well as directly to consumers Apple with its new partner Toshiba will become the fourth NAND giant Unlike a possible Micron acquisition of SanDisk an Apple acquisition of SanDisk is unlikely to draw objections from SanDisks joint venture partner Toshiba Apples relationship with Samsung has been strained for many years now While Apples smartphones tablets and Macs compete directly with Samsungs versions of those products Samsung has been a supplier of critical components of these Apple products including DRAM in its many forms and the fabrication of Apples A series SoCs By acquiring SanDisk Apple will be entering another market in direct competition with Samsung That really is not too significant as this strange relationship was and will likely remain tense for the foreseeable future By acquiring SanDisk Apple will now be in direct competition with the other two major NAND manufacturers Micron and SK Hynix This would not be a major concern if Micron SK Hynix and Samsung did not completely control the DRAM market Again Apple would find itself in competition with suppliers of essential components of all of its products Apple has been a customer of Samsung for many years and has been able to avoid punitively absurd prices because Apple has always had other friendly options albeit inferior options at times when it comes to DRAM NAND and its SOCs Unless there are some major advances in the performance endurance and speed of D XPoint or some yet to be announced memory solution DRAM will continue to be an absolute necessity in virtually all iDevices for the foreseeable future Does Apple really want to make an acquisition that will impair its relationship with all three manufacturers of a component that is absolutely necessary to build all of its iDevices Apple can and has used its weight as the pound gorilla to get preferential treatment from its suppliers However Micron SK Hynix and Samsung are not like Cirrus Logic or Omnivision Technologies The three DRAM manufacturers have formed a powerful memory oligopoly that could severely hamper Apples business by restricting the amount of DRAM Apple gets when the cyclical DRAM market eventually finds itself inevitably undersupplied again Apple is able to receive preferential pricing from its suppliers on many components However Apple is unlikely to get this treatment on next generation NVM nonvolatile memory in the shortintermediate term D XPoint is not yet available but will begin rolling out sometime in There have been no major announcements from SanDisk Samsung or SK Hynix that point to these three memory giants rolling out their respective version of next generation NVMs in the near future Its not difficult to imagine a world where Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>either completely control this next generation NVM market or find themselves significantly ahead on cost and performance relative to their competitors In this pseudomonopoly structure assuming partners Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>act rationally together Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have all the power in negotiations While D XPoint will initially likely be used mostly in IMDB and data centers it is hard to imagine that XPoint will not eventually find its way into the standard memory hierarchy of consumer electronics sometime after the timeframe Does Apple really want to be a direct competitor to the companies that may be the only viable producer of next generation NVM in the not too distant future I dont think so Apple is more than a technology company now It is a fashion brand On top of straining important supplier relationships Apple is unlikely to acquire SanDisk simply because the biggest electronics company in the world has little to no interest in selling flash drives memory cards SSDs and other commodity products that are unlikely to command premium pricing from Apple branding Enterprise customers arent going to pay huge premiums for an Apple logo on SSDs While I underestimated Apples ability to maintain significantly inflated margins on its smartphones and tablets it is probably safe to assume that nobody other than the craziest of Apple fanboys will pay enormous premiums for a USB flash drive with an Apple logo An acquisition of SanDisk might lower Apples cost of NAND in the shortterm assuming Apple acquires SanDisk at a reasonably low price However it is highly probable in my view that SanDisk is about to lose its position as the lowest cost producer of NAND When Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>start producing their D NAND product in high volume starting in SanDisk could find its relative position in NAND significantly impaired On top of the Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>solution Samsungs VNAND could also prove to be a lower cost NAND relative to SanDisks BiCS solution when the planar NAND era comes to an end The big four NAND manufacturers each have a different D NAND architecture and the cost per bit and performance of each memory may be vastly different Theres a good chance that SanDisks solution is inferior to that of some of its competitors which would only further disincentivize Apple from acquiring SanDisk as the cost of alienating the other memory manufacturers would only get higher In the most optimistic scenario I do not believe Apple could realize anything more than minimal cost savings by building NAND inhouse via a SanDisk acquisition instead of buying it from a third party Even if Apple has some interest in acquiring SanDisk it is highly unlikely that Apple would put in a bid of over billion Just because Apple has a digit cash reserve does not mean that it will be willing to significantly overpay for the value that SanDisk brings to Apple SanDisk adds little value for Apple in the long term For Western Digital SanDisk represents a potential lifeline when the HDD market inevitably collapses in a couple years down the road SanDisk is a nice to have for Apple at best I am not even sure if it is a nice to have for Apple Western Digital likely views SanDisk as critically important to its technology roadmap As a result I suspect the probability of an Apple acquisition of SanDisk is very low and probably far worse than odds In the end I believe SanDisks shareholders are very fortunate to get the big bid from Western Digital Its a great offer and I highly doubt there will be a surprise offer that initiates a bidding war for SanDisk Western Digitals acquisition of SanDisk will likely be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow each quarter However the bloated balance sheet loaded with debt poses significant longterm risk if Western DigitalSanDisk are unable to keep up with Samsung Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the move to D NAND and SSDs There is potential for the new company to end up with an inferior position in the NVM cost curve coupled with large interest payments While shortterm prospects may have marginally improved I would avoid
