class='textDiv'>Apple The Road To An ARMvA Based Product Stack And Higher Growth Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apples custom ARMvA cores are incredibly powerful and comparable to Intels big cores like Haswell and Skylake Apple has a world class chip design team through its acquisition of PA Semi and Intrinsity Apple is capable of scaling their custom ARMv core design to replace the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips which power their Macs thus unifying all their products under a single Instruction Set Architecture Apple could add custom hardware and accelerators to Mac chips and exploit them very well within the operating system and software applications to improve product differentiation and market share Apples profit margins would increase significantly if it were to use its own designed chips rather than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>designed chips Apple NASDAQ AAPL has impressed everyone with its efforts in the past few years with the design of high performance CPU microarchitectures Apple used ARM designed cores until the A SystemOnChip SoC used in the iPhone S and iPad Apple started designing custom CPU cores based on the ARM Instruction Set Architecture ISA with the Swift core in the A and AX SoC which powers the iPhone and iPad th generation respectively Swift was based on the bit ARMvA architecture The turning point in Apples CPU design efforts was the Cyclone CPU core based on the bit ARMvA architecture Apple was the first to market with a true bit ARMvA core well before even ARMs own Cortex A core launched Apples competitors like Samsung and Qualcomm have still not launched SoCs based on bit custom ARMvA cores even two years after the A SoC launched with the iPhone S Apples Cyclone and successors are formidable CPU cores and the first mobile CPU cores to be considered desktop class The term desktop class means the CPU core is capable of high Instructions per Clock IPC required for running productivity and content creation applications In particular the term desktop class is a direct comparison with Intels NASDAQ INTC big cores like Haswell and Skylake which are used in a range of products from tablets to notebooks desktops workstations and servers In fact to quote Anand Lal Shimpi of Anandtech Cyclone is a bold move by Apple but not one that is without its challenges I still find that there are almost no applications on iOS that really take advantage of the CPU power underneath the hood More than anything Apple needs firstparty software that really demonstrates whats possible The Cyclone core was a very forwardlooking design which hinted that Apple wanted their A series SoCs to be used for productivity and content creation rather than just content consumption We can now see with the launch of the iPad Pro that the reason for designing such high performance CPU cores was to broaden the market for the A series SoCs The iPad Pro will go after the same market segment as the Core M based tablets and ins and this contest should be an interesting one Apples partnership with IBM will help in this contest against the IntelMicrosoft duopoly in enterprise moblility devices and applications Apple was able to achieve their success in custom CPU design by building a world class chip design team through well targeted acquisitions in the field of semiconductor design Apple acquired PA Semi in April PA Semi had world class engineers who had worked on various architectures like DEC Alpha AMD Opteron Sun UltraSPARC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Itanium Apple acquired Intrinsity in April Apple has embarked on this journey with a longterm strategy of being able to differentiate their products from the competition Apples high performance custom CPU cores are a result of that strategy Apple also acquired a company named PrimeSense in November which provided products in the area of sensory inputs for consumer and commercial markets Apples D Touch seems to be a good use of the technology acquired by Apple We clearly see Apple leveraging its unique advantage as the designer of both the hardware and software of their mobile devices to bring significant product differentiation Apple is very well capable of improving their custom ARMv core to scale to high frequency and address the high performance needs of the Mac lineup Apple also can uniquely add custom hardware and accelerators to its Mac chips which would give it a competitive advantage and improved product differentiation The Mac product lineup is growing both in units and revenue yoy in a shrinking PC market This means Apple Macs are gaining share against Windows PCs even though the current Mac share of the PC market is still very small at There is a huge opportunity to leverage the advantage of being able to provide the hardware and software and improve the product differentiation and market share of the Macs Apple also can add more CPU cores and provide more performance than would be available to them if they purchased standard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core ii and Xeon CPUs Apple could ship the iMacs and MacBook Pros with a core CPU with added support for Simultaneous Multithreading NASDAQ SMT and provide cores and threads compared to the four cores and eight threads available on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core i chips used in the same devices Similarly the Mac Pro could be designed with cores ands threads instead of the current Xeons chips used which sport eight cores and threads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is more focused on protecting its high gross margins and is unlikely to provide more cores at the same price points <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been conditioned by a complete lack of competition in the highend PC and server market due to AMDs NASDAQ AMD failures and has no interest in providing significantly more coresperformance for the same prices Apples manufacturing costs would still be much lower even with larger die sizes as Apple pays much lower prices for processed semiconductor wafers from a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM compared to finished CPUs from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The AX chip with a die size of sq mm costs USD per chip according to cost estimates from IHS The AX die size and cost are not yet known accurately but the AX is guaranteed to be much cheaper to manufacture than the Skylake Core m Y which has a die size of sq mm and a cost of USD per chip Apple might get lower volume pricing from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>than publicly published prices but still its going to be much more than the cost of a chip manufactured at a foundry We also can extrapolate from the initial Geekbench scores of A and Core m Y that the AX chip with three true cores is expected to have similar single core performance and better multicore performance than the Skylake Core m Y cores threads on the Geekbench test suite We will see a wider range of CPU performance comparison benchmarks once the iPad Pro is launched and is compared with Core m Ybased tablets The ability to design custom silicon is a major advantage that Apple should exploit to further differentiate Macs broaden their appeal and improve sales Apple could add accelerators in their chips to further improve performance for certain types of workloads The flexibility of being able to add custom silicon would directly translate to much better performance in the targeted workloads This will help in improving the Macs competitive positioning against Windowsbased PCs Apple could also charge higher selling prices as it leverages the improved product positioning This would directly translate to better profits earnings per share and improved share price value The key enabler of this transition to an ARMvA based product stack is the rapid growth of the foundry manufacturers like TSMC and the pace at which they are closing the process node gap with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Apple can use the intense competition among foundries and Intels foundry aspirations to their benefit Apple can chose the best process node available from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>TSMC and Samsung based on transistor performance yields supply volume and pricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could still benefit if it aggressively pursues Apple as a foundry customer Apple is the leading consumer of silicon on bleeding edge process nodes and would be a huge win for any foundry or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The last piece of the puzzle is the software ecosystem Apple can very well handle porting of the Mac operating system and first party applications from x to ARMvA The key challenge is the support from thirdparty developers We have seen that software ecosystem support for Apples custom ARMvA cores has started improving with Microsoft releasing Office for iPad and Adobe releasing their creative tools for iPad Pro Apple still has its work cut out and needs to engage with the software ecosystem and get them to port their x desktop and workstation applications to ARMvA The task is challenging but Apple can pull it off Apple has shown they are capable of changing ISA when they moved from IBM PowerPC to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x In conclusion Apple is well on its way to an ARMvA based product stack unifying all its products under a single ISA Apple has always prided itself on being able to closely integrate welldesigned hardware and software where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts The move to an ARMvA based product stack is a logical extension of that philosophy Apples profit margins will increase and there is good potential for higher market share growth for Macs This also would lead to many more years of sustained growth in revenues and share price growth for the
