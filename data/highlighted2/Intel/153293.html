Seeking Alpha ATT has added the Asus ZenFone E Android phone to its GoPhone Prepaid program Asustek is the first major OEM to release an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoFIApowered phablet the ZenPad Asustek OTCASUUY Chairman Jonney Shih has upgraded his strategy to sell more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Atompowered ZenFone smartphones in the US Mr Shih previously said that the Asus ZenFone could succeed in the US even without the support of US carriers However ATT NYSE T probably liked the rising global success of the ZenFone brand and has therefore added the ZenFone E Android smartphone to its GoPhone prepaid program Carrier support is major positive factor when it comes to determining the market success of smartphones This exclusive deal between Asus and ATT could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sell more mobile application processors The ZenFone E is the most affordable but still LTEenabled version version of the bestselling ZenFone The ZenFone E has a solid build and still looks like the version but it comes with a less powerful CPUGPU and less RAMinternal storage The price tag of the ZenFone E makes it the cheapest GoPhone handset from ATT It is much more affordable than the Motorola Moto G GoPhone Edition and LG OTCLGEAF Xpression Furthermore the inch ATT GoPhone version uses the same dualcore GHz Atom Z processor PowerVR SGXMP GPU and GB RAM as my old inch Asus FonePad phablet The ZenFone E could also be a decent heavyduty mobile gaming machine like the FonePad is which never overheats even after hours of continuous D gaming The nooverheatingwhengaming feature is a distinguishing feature that could really help the ZenFone E perform better against other GoPhone handsets The importance of the ZenFone E deal is that it could lead to ATT also supporting the more expensive variants of the Asus ZenFone ATT is a very prolific vendor of prepaid phones in the US Asus remains the best friend of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>when it comes to smartphone application processors It is the first major OEM to release a SoFIA Atom Xpowered phablet for the global market The Asus ZenPad is a inch phablet with a GHz quadcore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom xC bit processor GB of RAM GB of storage and a Mali MP GPU The Asus ZenPad like my FonePad can serve as a dualSIM mobile phone The ZenPad will compete with extralarge ARMbased Android phones like Huaweis MediaPad X and Acers Iconia Tab phablet The very low price tag of the ZenPad belies its decent hardware specs and excellent features It actually has premiumlike features like a MPMP dualcamera system with Pixelmaster technology for great lowlight photography ZenPad also touts DTS HD Cinematic surround audio and a Gorilla Glass screen protection I opine that If ATT also starts selling its own variant of the ZenTab Intelpowered phablets might see stronger sales in America In spite of the continuing decline in sales of tablets more US customers are actually buyingsubscribing for cellularenabled tablets Cellular tablets or giant phablets have become the growth drivers for ATT and other US carriers this year Due to weak demand for new phones tablet sales accounted for all of ATTs growth in Q wherein the company achieved postpaid cellular tablet subscriptions During the same period it lost postpaid phone subscribers My point is that larger phablets like the Intelpowered Asus ZenPad are now the saving grace of the tablet industry Unlike Samsung OTCSSNLF and Apple NASDAQ AAPL which still have a strong focus on selling WiFionly tablets Asus is smart enough to see that majority of consumers now favor the cellular tablet product Asus is now the thlargest tablet vendor in Western Europe but it is still an underappreciated brand in North America It will be to the benefit of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>if Asus also becomes the No tabletphablet vendor in the US Asus aims to sell million ZenFone products this year An ATTbacked ZenFone with LTE and great gaming features should be attractive even to American buyers Carrier backing is very important to Intels future as regards mobile devices Carrier support has helped LG Electronics become the thlargest vendor of smartphones in America with market share Unfortunately LG has yet to make a serious effort towards using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom CPUs inside its tablets or smartphone products ATTs support for an Intelpowered smartphone could go a long way in helping Asus penetrate the US market LGbranded phones are being distributed by the four largest carriers in America Mr Shih ought to outmaneuver LG and persuade the rivals of ATT to also carry the ZenFone and ZenPad devices The AsusATT deal is another good reason why we all should keep our faith on <span style='background-color:
