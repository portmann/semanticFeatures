However, Micron also is at odds with this, because even if they can reap the full rewards after 2018, they're still not able to sell as effectively into the data center space for the next three years.Consumers aren't going to adopt this technology as quickly because they're going to buy at the low-end primarily, and if tablets are able to ship with the cheaper flash memory at 64GB at a sub $300 price point, then consumers are going to jump on that versus a really expensive PC with cutting edge memory and CPU.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore, the difference in 3D XPoint isn't as wide when compared to NAND. (Uncertainty) </span>That's because the logarithmic shrink in read speeds happens at the microsecond to nanosecond scale, which implies that today's applications aren't going to look that much more smoother.However, the transition from rotating disks to NAND flash went from microseconds to milliseconds, which is way more noticeable on a neurological level.In other words, 3DXpoint opens up a pathway for enthusiasts to brag about further future proofing their current PCs, which limits the market potential to PCs that are priced above $1,000.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I'm not even sure if Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will release their mainstream MacBook line-up with this new technology, but I do anticipate Samsung's second generation 32-layer V-NAND chips to hit the market first and to be priced even more aggressively than Micron's SSDs. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sure, we could argue about the technological specifics all day, but there's no denying that Samsung tends to engage in price wars and has won much of the memory business over the years due to pricing alone. (Uncertainty) </span>Therefore, the bigger theme for memory in 2016 is going to be NAND flash.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>PC OEMs will move further up the memory stack from 128GB to perhaps 512 GB to 1 TB storage options in response to cheaper pricing. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will be blamed on Samsung, as they've lowered their pricing throughout 2015 and will likely cut pricing even more aggressively as they further optimize their nodes for more efficiency and higher density. (Uncertainty) </span>The price points for the upcoming SSDS to be released by Samsung are $125 to $290 for 120GB to 480 GB.I can already imagine Apple releasing the MacBook Pro with 480 GB of flash memory at a $2,000 price point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps the $2,500 model will come with 1TB of flash memory, especially if Apple passes on the cost savings to consumers. (Uncertainty) </span>Also, this is the fastest growing mainstream enthusiast PC segment, and I don't think Micron will gain much traction in that specific space, as there's a lot of competition.Therefore, I'm not ready to say that Micron is an overnight buy.Sure, they've come up with a revolutionary technology, but they're not positioned yet to capitalize on it immediately.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will give competitors a window of opportunity to build up their own technological capabilities, which may result in Micron losing somewhat of an edge. (Uncertainty) </span>I'm not pessimistic, but I'm not yet ready to recommend the stock to anybody at the present time.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.
