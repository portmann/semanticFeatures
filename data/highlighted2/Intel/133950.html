Hasnt Micron Stock Responded To D XPoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha D XPoint is faster denser and has greater endurance than NAND However Micron has very little incentive to move the pricing down and has limited sellthrough capability into the enterprise This implies that Micron might not be able to capitalize on the technology immediately despite having a final product Furthermore competition in stiffening in the layer D NAND space as Samsung is going to be on its second generation VNAND in the August time frame I reviewed the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU presentation yesterday and for the most part I thought D XPoint was one of those once in a decade aha moments for the PC Its faster denser and has greater endurance than NAND Flash According to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>press release its times faster than NAND times denser than conventional memory and has times the endurance However the new technology will take a couple of years to truly mature and I see a narrow space in which there will be immediate adoption which is in the data center Because the memory access speeds are so fast the high performance computing ie super computers will find the quicker read speeds pretty useful However conventional data centers can use a mix of faster and slower memory read and write speeds because some data is purely for storage and other data is used on a regular basis So the presentation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron put on talked a lot about the potential use cases But I think that for those use cases to materialize there needs to be a wave of adoption from consumers in order for software designers to really invest the time and effort into creating those more powerful programs In other words its not enough to have better technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron need to develop a powerful business model that can quickly reach the mass market This will be difficult and quite frankly the time it will take to reach that massive adoption also will require <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron to disrupt their own cost structure a little bit I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron might not have the incentive to take D XPoint and compete with themselves by pricing the product low enough so that it displaces demand for both DRAM and SSDs Theyre going to maximize profitability which makes sense from a business context but its certainly not going to render the remaining competitors bankrupt overnight If you look at the stock price there was an immediate move to the upside following the announcement However the weak reaction more or less confirms my thought process This new technology while powerful isnt going to immediately move the needle in terms of revenue or profitability Theres the ongoing issue of how this might or might not benefit Micron I say this because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>secures the wafers from the Utah facility at the cost of goods sold theyre not paying any more or any less than Micron for that same unit However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a way more efficient channel to sell DXpoint than Micron because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can also bundle servers CPUs coprocessors and even FPGAs This means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can offer far more value than Micron can because they can sell the remaining components for a lower price and in return generate more in total revenue than Micron can from a similar transaction So if anything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the bigger winner in the immediate short run as the company has a very strong relationship with the top cloud providers in the server space In fact many of the top PC OEMs have built their PC manufacturing near various <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fabs which kind of explains how streamlined the process of integrating an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SKU is in comparison to Micron That being the case Im not saying Micron wont generate value from this new memory technology I just think that the stock price reflects how exposed the company could be to competitors like Samsung OTC SSNLF while also having a very limited presence in data centers Intels DCG did pretty well and a lot of that is driven by the growth in both SSDs and CPUs in the space Not only are computing needs going up but the same could be said for storage requirements However Micron tends to focus more on retail channels and might have better sell through to consumer PCs However we all know that the PC cycle is at its trough and Micron along with the rest of the PC industry got hammered for being overly dependent on the cyclical nature of PCs At this rate a whole wave of computers will need to fall apart and break down before consumers are willing to replace their computers and even then were not even sure if theyre going to buy another PC because they can consume a lot of content on tablets and gain access to a richer app library So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>really wants to strike a hammer on the entire industry it would sell DXpoint at a lower per GB rate than they sell SSDs starving competitors by having a faster cheaper better and more reliable product Over the short run it would rampup revenue and it would mitigate the available resources for competitors to plough back into RD This strategy when taken to an extreme also would irritate shareholders who are looking for a steady dividend stream so its unlikely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron could capitalize very quickly on their first mover advantage However competitors wanting to catch up could find this to be extremely difficult because its a fundamentally new technology That being the case theres going to be a lot of pressure on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to at least extend the length of their business relationship with Micron How will they do that I dont know because they originally agreed on a call contract that Micron will use to buy back the remaining stake in IMFT in This means that the breakthrough technology they had developed jointly has only limited value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or in finance speak the terminal value of IMFT is limited However Micron also is at odds with this because even if they can reap the full rewards after theyre still not able to sell as effectively into the data center space for the next three years Consumers arent going to adopt this technology as quickly because theyre going to buy at the lowend primarily and if tablets are able to ship with the cheaper flash memory at GB at a sub price point then consumers are going to jump on that versus a really expensive PC with cutting edge memory and CPU Furthermore the difference in D XPoint isnt as wide when compared to NAND Thats because the logarithmic shrink in read speeds happens at the microsecond to nanosecond scale which implies that todays applications arent going to look that much more smoother However the transition from rotating disks to NAND flash went from microseconds to milliseconds which is way more noticeable on a neurological level In other words DXpoint opens up a pathway for enthusiasts to brag about further future proofing their current PCs which limits the market potential to PCs that are priced above Im not even sure if Apple NASDAQ AAPL will release their mainstream MacBook lineup with this new technology but I do anticipate Samsungs second generation layer VNAND chips to hit the market first and to be priced even more aggressively than Microns SSDs Sure we could argue about the technological specifics all day but theres no denying that Samsung tends to engage in price wars and has won much of the memory business over the years due to pricing alone Therefore the bigger theme for memory in is going to be NAND flash PC OEMs will move further up the memory stack from GB to perhaps GB to TB storage options in response to cheaper pricing This will be blamed on Samsung as theyve lowered their pricing throughout and will likely cut pricing even more aggressively as they further optimize their nodes for more efficiency and higher density The price points for the upcoming SSDS to be released by Samsung are to for GB to GB I can already imagine Apple releasing the MacBook Pro with GB of flash memory at a price point Perhaps the model will come with TB of flash memory especially if Apple passes on the cost savings to consumers Also this is the fastest growing mainstream enthusiast PC segment and I dont think Micron will gain much traction in that specific space as theres a lot of competition Therefore Im not ready to say that Micron is an overnight buy Sure theyve come up with a revolutionary technology but theyre not positioned yet to capitalize on it immediately This will give competitors a window of opportunity to build up their own technological capabilities which may result in Micron losing somewhat of an edge
