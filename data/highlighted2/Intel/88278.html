in the market for acquisitions in order to stem top line erosion In early April I ignored excessive put buying in InvenSense to my chagrin InvenSense NYSE INVN experienced unusual trading volume in its September call options strike price contracts were traded The underlying stock was up nearly as million shares changed hands nearly three times the normal trading volume According to optionMONSTERs Pete Najarian the call volume during a down day for the general market was perplexing Pete Najarian noted there has been heavy buying of September calls sporting an strike price over K contracts have been traded today Makes you scratch your head and wonder why says Najarian who is going long via shorterterm calls INVN is down about over the past months versus a gain for the SP SPX The company has been dogged by declining gross margins the thesis that the company has sacrificed margins to court Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Samsung OTCSSNLF has created an overhang in the shares I have recommended that investors avoid INVN given its declining margins and the potential loss of a large customer For its most recent quarter Apple and Samsung represented a combined of total revenue That said I too believe the excessive call volume is more than a coincidence I took a small long position in some of the companys shortdated options an event could be in the cards for the following reasons InvenSense has been the subject of takeover rumors involving names like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM The companys accelerometers gyroscopes and microphones could be excellent additions to the product lines of these names Coincidentally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm are also experiencing stagnant to declining revenue growth Intels Client Computing segment which houses its mobile operations experienced an YY decline in revenue during its most recent quarter Meanwhile Qualcomms revenue fell sequentially due to a loss of Samsung business and a decline in its average sales price Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomm and other technology companies may be forced to be acquisitive simply to stem topline erosion Intels recent acquisition of Altera NASDAQ ALTR was a defensive move in my opinion INVN longs may be next to benefit when a big tech company wants get defensive In early April I received the following cryptic message concerning INVN Shock Exchange would you have any insight into whether or not there is competition with INVN for accelerometers or OIS in the Galaxy S Evidently a lot of INVN puts were bought today and a staggering amount over the past two days I had been aware of reports of excessive put buying after a Chipworks teardown of the Samsung Galaxy S showed a touch screen controller from STMicroelectonics NYSE STM the short thesis was that InvenSense would have less share inside the S visavis the S I did not act on the news because I thought the downside had already been price into the stock I have since gone back and forth with INVN longs whether STMicroelectronics had indeed taken share from INVN inside the S The stock has traded sideways ever since early April buttressing the short case Secondly given that InvenSense is inside Apple and Samsung phones the two global market share leaders I expected forward revenue growth to offset declining margins However management guided that fiscal Q revenue would be million this is practically flat compared to fiscal Q revenue of million I took this as further evidence that the company was losing share inside the Galaxy S to STMicroelectronics In early April I ignored excessive put buying in INVN to my chagrin Monday I piggybacked on
