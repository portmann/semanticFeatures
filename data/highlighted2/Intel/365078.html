server chips is growing at yr and provides more than of Intels profit Google recently announced it is developing apps for both IBM Power and ARM chips Intels NASDAQ INTC stock hit a month high of on Dec Since then it has been range bound between about and The reason for this is the sluggish sales of desktops CCG Client Computing Group integrating the Altera acquisition the miniscule or nonexistent sales of D NAND and the lack of growth in the highly touted IoT Products Group Offsetting all this bad news is the robust sales of the DCG Data Center Group as enterprise users gobble up millions of server chips as they try to keep up with the ever increasing demand for cloud storage and data delivery The biggest problem is the DCGs virtual monopoly market share on server chips has come into the view of Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL IBM NYSE IBM ARM NASDAQ ARMH and AMD NASDAQ AMD all of whom would like to see that number come down substantially This is the continuation of a theme I outlined here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Versus Qualcomm Whos The Chip Champ Going Forward here More Woes For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Chip Chip Chipping Away At Chipzilla and here AMD Zens Release Will Be Taking Names And Kicking Bandwidth Sooner Rather Than Later In this article I will examine whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can respond to the challenges it faces in the allimportant server chip markets No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking Voltaire Google has announced it is writing apps for the IBM Power series and ARM server chips The Power architecture is now fully supported across our toolchain said Maire Mahony a hardware engineering manager at Google and director of the OpenPower Foundation This is an important turning point for nonIntel chip manufacturers because whatever Google does is likely to also be done by all the other server chip devouring companies like Facebook NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN cloud servers and maybe even Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT who uses ARM chips in its phones Another reason why this development might be worrisome to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the ever increasing use of Linux on the enterprise Linux is the operating system of choice for cloud servers such as Google Amazon and Facebook and Linux does not need Intels x instruction set required by Windows servers Keep in mind Googles Android system is Linux based Heres an article by Bloombergcom titled Google taps IBM Rackspace to Dent Intels Hold on Server chips The title pretty much describes Intels problem This was the most interesting comment Every line of software code that Google writes is now tested to make sure it can run on OpenPower or ARMbased chips That sure sounds like a change is coming Intels response will be to bundle its Xeon chips with Alteras FPGA Field Programmable Gate Arrays hopefully giving them a performance advantage over the newcomers The problem is IBM and ARM can add FPGA chips too And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not home free in the Windows server market either as AMD plans to release its new Zen chip later this year and a server version in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has for all practical purposes a market share in Windows servers and while AMD is too small to have a big effect it may require <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to lower prices and subsequently margins to maintain a plus share This is important as you can see from the following graphic that shows operating cash flow in billion dollars shrinking over the last several years One of the mistakes investors make concerning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is forgetting how big it is It is a behemoth with billion in sales in and billion of that being CCG and DCG That means if CCG continues to falter andor DCG finally faces some real competition there is nothing on the bench to replace the profits of the two superstars The software group and IoT combined had less than of CCG and DCGs profit so a little downturn in the big two will overwhelm any increase in the two little guys To give you an idea how daunting this task is I have done a spreadsheet showing D NAND and D Xpoint both surging to of sales or billion each That is ignoring the probability that D NAND will replace virtually all of the billion in D NAND sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had in Assuming also that profit margins are the same as the semimonopoly x products another unlikely possibility in my estimation EPS grows to about per share The question then becomes which year will it be that Intels D products generate billion in sales Or to put it another way when do Intels D products grow from zero to almost the size of Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN billion in sales When that happens <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will make per share Is that or what year And if you believe that big sales are on the way for Intels D products why not invest in Joint Venture partner Micron NASDAQ MU instead After all Micron already sells more NAND than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and if the supernova Texas Instruments size sales are coming for D then Micron at less than per share is a much better investment choice because the effect on its sales and earnings would be spectacular at about per share I think Micron is the choice as I outlined here Micron At Under A Share Even I Would Be A Buyer and here Sometimes An Ugly Duckling Turns Into A Beautiful Swan Buy Micron Under Of course adding those two aggressive sales targets together and you are looking at going from zero to almost Qualcomms size billion That certainly gives pause when you think about it that way Intels huge cash flow depends upon the continued growth of its two stalwarts desktop and server chips The semimonopoly status of these dominant groups generates huge margins that are not possible in any of their other groups Therefore if either of these two falters there is nowhere to go for help None of the other groups have anywhere near the sales let alone the margins to make up for anything but minor hiccups if that True there is D NAND and D Xpoint coming down the road and they may be able to supply some ammunition to the beleaguered Big but high volume sales and high productive margins are somewhere down the road Maybe late D NAND can help and maybe in D Xpoint will kick in some big profits But until then things look meager indeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is at best a hold though its dividend does provide some downside protection I would remain on the sidelines until I can see a more certain source of sales and especially profits falling to the bottom line Until then it is a wait and see Micron is a buy here because of its low price which is currently below book value I am long Micron I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Technology Semiconductor Broad Line </div></body></html>
