Rumors are surfacing of an AMDbranded FPGA The design seems legitimate However the FPGPA space is competitive and its highly unlikely that AMD will design a competitive chip to Altera or Xilinx On the bright side AMD seems to be making solid progress toward a nm Zen family Opteron If they can fit in both an architectural and node improvement the CPU may keep up with Skylake performance wise However there have been numerous cases where AMD promises big but delivers nothing Therefore my primary buy case is based on a scenario in which AMD is acquired A new rumor made the rounds but this time Im not exactly certain if it will help AMD NASDAQ AMD shareholders much According to IT World reports are surfacing of AMD developing an FPGA which is basically a field programmable array Its sort of like an application specific integrated circuit ASIC in that the hardware development language is optimized to run certain lines of code more efficiently in comparison to a general purpose CPU Furthermore an FPGA can be altered or reprogrammed which optimizes the FPGA for a different set of algorithms thus making the FPGA more multifaceted in comparison to an ASIC The problem I see with AMD attempting to enter into the FPGA market is the sheer competition and the ongoing consolidation of various semiconductors in the space With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC acquiring Altera NASDAQ ALTR its only going to be a matter of time before Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX is then acquired by a different company presumably Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM or Samsung OTC SSNLF Therefore AMDs efforts may amount to little more than feel good PR Following the rumors of AMDs FPGA the stock hasnt really reacted by much The real upside to owning AMD doesnt really come from the products but whether a suitable acquirer will emerge Alteras FPGAs ie the Stratix is going to be in volume production at nm The Stratix is the latest FPGA from Altera And quite frankly the performance of the Stratix has improved quite considerably as the company mentions that its the densest and most powerful FPGA they have designed yet Theyve included more hyper registers into the routing elements to reduce the routing delay and it will also have million logic elements which make it the densest and largest single chip package Therefore Im not completely convinced in AMDs strategy to develop a FPGA Perhaps theyre simply doing this out of desperation After all Intels upcoming platform dubbed Purley will integrate FPGAs CoCPUs and CPUs into a single motherboard The memory transfer rates ie the bandwidth will also improve to accommodate for faster SSDs and D XPoint This makes Intels upcoming server platform the most comprehensive yet AMD on the other hand has continued to slide in the server CPU space as the market share has declined into single digits At this point its fair to assume that various vendors wont integrate Opterons even if a competitive FPGA were to emerge as the performance likely wont be on par with Intels fully integrated platform which comes with more bells and whistles than what AMD can hope to put together in a two to threeyear timeframe On the bright side AMDs upcoming Zenbased Opterons are projected to gain a performance improvement due to support for DDR memory simultaneous multithreading and also will include a highbandwidth lowlatency cache system The performance of the chip should improve but Im not exactly certain if it will catch up to Skylake The Zenbased Opterons are expected to launch sometime in whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake also will be released in My guess <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will release Skylake in the first half of whereas AMD will release Zen in the second half of It will take at least six months for AMD to build up a reasonable level of inventory and make architectural improvements in the tight time frame AMD might keepup with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the server space on the CPU front but reaching into FPGAs could be somewhat of a stretch given AMDs limited budget for RD Im reiterating my buy recommendation on AMD but thats only driven by broader industry consolidation If AMD gets bought out the stock will move by to in a short period of time Therefore buying low and selling high will likely work in this specific instance Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks
