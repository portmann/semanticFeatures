shareholders The value of the cash will be mitigated by tax deferred liabilities FX impact and operational dissynergies The cash needs to be brought home to sustain product development as evidenced by the divergence in headcounttofree cash flow growth Furthermore a larger scale buyback even with the US tax penalty is more accretive to the stock than leaving it overseas In the past couple months theres no denying that Ive been a lot more bearish with regards to Apple NASDAQ AAPL Furthermore the primary justification for buying Apple seems to be the valuation which is a highly debatable topic As many of you already know valuation is all relative The excash PE assumptions by many within the buyside community seem inflated due to the deferred tax assumptions and the indefinite reinvestment of cash generated outside of the United States This puts a ceiling on the cash usage for share buybacks and dividends so while FCF metrics remain strong its worth noting that a substantial chunk of that cash is inaccessible unless theres a substantial change in the regulatory framework of the US tax code Given the heightened competitive environment and currency dynamics the management team needs to repatriate some of the cash due to the heightening cost of currency hedges and the lack of investment use in overseas markets According to Apples Annual Report The Companys effective tax rates for and differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland for which no US taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the US The higher effective tax rate during compared to was due primarily to higher foreign taxes The effective tax rate in compared to was relatively flat As of September the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of billion and deferred tax liabilities of billion Since of Apples cash generation comes from overseas the longterm funding of buybacks and dividends will have a low ceiling and will come primarily from cash generation within the United States In the next fiscal year US earnings will diverge from rest of world which is why Im dubious of a higher buyback authorization While cash generation abroad will help to sustain the top line growth rate the corporate level earnings are not equally distributed for shareholder use The deferred tax liabilities of billion will eventually take a sizable chunk out of the foreign cash position and the indefinite classification of earnings set for permanent reinvestment outside of the United States limits the usefulness of cash MA opportunities outside of the United States are extremely limited as VCbacked firms are primarily located within the United States Tim Cook doesnt routinely pursue acquisitions and likes to develop businesses organically Therefore immediate accretion to topline seems unlikely which limits the value of cash sitting abroad Not only are the investment use cases weaker foreign tax rates will likely adjust higher The best software and hardware engineers live within America along the western corridor of the United States Gaining a greater foothold on qualified engineering talent should be given higher priority The firms that can amass the highest amount of qualified talent can stay in the game longer due to the scale and creativity of the labor base Firms within the tech space expend a lot of resources on hiring and retaining talent due to the high cost of turnover and the pressure to remain competitive Apple is obviously competitive but the incremental cash generation overseas doesnt really have a impact on operational efficiency Apples FCF grew by whereas the labor headcount increased by over the past five years Apple stressese efficiency but as you all know theres strength in numbers Ask Germany how things went on the Russian front in World War Russia had the bigger army and rolled over Germany in tank warfare once weather conditions changed circa to Likewise I view Apple through that lens Not enough manpower to sustain its own blitzkrieg offense through the tech vertical Apple has developed large markets for itself across smartphone tablet PC and software However Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Samsung OTCSSNLF are quick to copy and implement some of Apples strategies whenever possible If theres any tech story worth remembering its Apples With a unified coalition of tech giants forming along Apples battle lines the company needs to double down on investment Bragging about efficiency and the value of its brand will only carry the company so far It needs to find a productive use for all of its cash Apples response has been strong but from where I stand investment into its head count should have matched FCF growth Microsoft is firing back with a unified OS ecosystem Surface and ins Google owns five of the most valuable mobile apps and has the most mobile OS market share Samsung cant develop its own mobile ecosystem unless Google decides to support that new platform which they wont So its Samsung and Google versus Apple while Microsoft is building its own ecosystem away from the remaining two companies In the case of Apple there are threats everywhere The tech space is dynamic with war being waged on three major fronts It boils down to Apple versus Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Wintel alliance versus Google Samsung GoogSung alliance Apple is operating at less than half of its potential operating efficiency The company will need to bring its cash home to leverage its assets abroad and Im not sure if Apples CEO will eat the tax expense The company should emphasize operational efficiency over corporate tax accounting While I admire the CEO of Apple I can imagine a repeat of board level thinking steering the Apple ship in the wrong direction If anything Tim will need to convince the board of directors to bring some of the cash back prematurely to sustain investment into new products Holding out for a tax holiday is a passive strategy that relies on favorable externalities that may never materialize According to Apples annual report Apple held billion in cash and cash equivalents in foreign accounts The vast majority of the cash and cash equivalents were dollardenominated I anticipate Apple will need to pay an incremental tax of to to bring the cash home The billion to billion tax expense leaves billion or so when averaging for both scenarios This leaves Apple in a position to acquire mid cap companies at an average valuation of billion or small cap companies at an average valuation of billion Alternatively Apple could use the cash to buy back billion shares which would lower the total share outstanding to billion to billion assuming a cost basis of per share At this point Apple might as well increase its RD to billion from the current billion which will mitigate some profitability However nearly doubling RD and returning the cash in the form of buybacks or expanding the business through acquisitions will address bottom line growth substantially better Theres billion left on the current share buyback authorization so if I were to combine that with billion from foreign assets Apple could pursue an accelerated buyback program of billion The billion would reduce share count by billion shares if the share price were to remain stagnant The company could then use next year earnings to double the size of its RD team This would result in earnings growth for next year despite heightened OpEX It would also reassert Apples competitive strength in consumer electronics Assuming Apple were to execute on an accelerated buyback that reduces share count by billion shares and increases OpEx by billion I model EPS of and a price target The company would experience immediate shareholder accretion despite the heightened tax expense In other words Apple looks penny wise but pound foolish With higher foreign taxes a guaranteed certainty better use cases for the cash materializing and FX volatility mitigating foreign asset values Apple might as well bring the cash home I continue to reiterate my sell rating and price target We only use your
