data collected by machines processed by machines and analyzed by machines to help humans Is IoT past the peak of the hype cycle or rising on the slope of enlightenment Security may be one of the areas most benefited by IoT IoT building blocks for Americas Greatest Makers First a few observations comparing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC IoT Insights to the <span

</span>CEO was present in body but seemed preoccupied with other matters maybe nm yields In the slides were more complex and yet more compelling In the Things to Gateway to Cloud is presented as a less daunting challenge using the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>developer tools In security was stressed In security was addressed by an Enhanced Privacy ID that specifically confirms the identity of each person each device each software each set of data and each Thing in multiple ways In IoT was near the peak of inflated expectations In late IoT seems to be starting the climb up the slope of enlightenment The IoT Insights presentations were impressive in December helping to shine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock into the upper s It seems that was the trough of disillusionment and now we are starting up the slope of enlightenment to increased profits Machine Collection Processing and Analysis Video taking processing pattern recognition analytics and D video are all coming into real world applications Drones can now autonomously survey agricultural fields and collect huge amounts of data for analysis and development of action plans to increase yields and use just the right amount of water The drones fly autonomously using D cameras and collect mountains of data including video This data is then processed in an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Gateway processor and important data is sent to the cloud for further analytics and comparison with data from other fields Actions are then developed and implemented through Things like water valves that have microcontrollers connected to the cloud This type of monitoring and action used to be done by a farmer riding a horse around his fields and opening ditches to allow water to reach parts of his field Now much larger agricultural areas can benefit from increased monitoring and action based on observations Quark microcontrollers to collect data and control Things Linex system to collect and process the information Platform of connections to the cloud Simplified cloud where networks computing and storage are all virtualized on general purpose processors with specialized FPGA chips for cost effective and fast development of actions to benefit humans Similar applications were shown for First Responders where data is automatically collected from microcontrollers on a first responder and transmitted about temperatures posture breathing heart beat air quality location and movement back to a Gateway where real time information is available for analysis automatic warningsalarms and decision making by supervisors Building HVAC systems human bodies retail sales Levi oil platforms NYSE SAP and many other systems can benefit from such automated machine data gathering analysis and actions This IoT roadmap provides some sense of the wide breadth of processor microcontroller and sensor products <span style='background-color:

half an hour The devices were made by Yanzi using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>IP and chips The devices now either plug into outlets or use such low levels of energy that battery powered units can last for years A D model of the building then allows easy access on a touch screen to pinpoint data from each unit and control various devices This type of a building installation is now something that is ready to be scaled to tens of thousands of buildings around the world to reduce energy use and create a more comfortable and customized environment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also has focused on making the IoT platform easier to connect to the Cloud and easier to analyze data once it is in the cloud of corporations surveyed believe they have valuable data but they think it is too hard to get the value out of the data of the effort is in data cleaning and organizing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has provided free open source platforms for development and sharing of cloud systems including Platform Management Security Orchestration One very popular open source platform is TAP Trusted Analytics Platform where users contribute and all benefit from sharing what they have individually or jointly developed to address data analytics needs Since TAP was announced mid year there are corporate engagements The response has been huge The First Responder system described above developed by Honeywell took less than two weeks to develop and deploy using exiting sensor units and data analytics tools <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has developed the platforms microcontrollers and processors that can scale IoT out to the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>presented a new to me approach to security This approach provides every person thing software and dataset an enhanced ID that can be analyzed in relation to its surroundings Pattern recognition algorithms then compare patterns with accepted patterns to prevent privacysecurity breaches monitor for potential breaches and take action to resolve such breaches The attack surface is bigger with IoT so the methods to secure privacy must address the enlarged surface The protectdetectcorrect security process must be repeated quickly and continuously This new and necessary approach to security requires high levels of communication and pattern recognition computing IoT creates the need for this new approach to security and provides the tools needed to address the need <span

August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Mark Burnett Survivor creator announced a TV reality program called Americas Greatest Makers to launch in This series will pit makers against each other in a bid to produce a cuttingedge wearable and the winner will take home a million prize The IoT devices and platforms revealed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
