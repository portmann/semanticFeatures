in how we interface with technology are making PCs obsolete Monopoly power has been broken by the rise of RISC architecture When I read the Strategic Roadmap published by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC CEO Bryan Kzanich I finally threw in the towel on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>after staying invested for the last years How does a company that spends B annually in capex and RD combined face such a daunting future With that much investment is it possible for them to fail The answer is yes Many companies struggling with technological shifts have pointed toward the Internet of Things to save them Cisco NASDAQ CSCO IBM NYSE IBM Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and a host of other SP companies are touting IoT as the next big thing and it will likely be so but how often do old established companies successfully shift to an entirely new market Think Kodak NYSE KODK Its much more likely that new entrants unencumbered by the past will dominate the IoT market not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomm may have a better chance but the competition and pricing will be fierce and the commodity products being the architecture and chips are not where the value will be derived Creating the IoT is one thing extracting value from the network and data is entirely another and this is not Intels domain Not many people remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had a shot at becoming a player in mobile architecture In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sold its RISCbased architecture division XScale Technology to Marvell NASDAQ MRVL for million right before the launch of the smartphone revolution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips were already powering some BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY phones At the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stated it was divesting of noncore assets to focus on its x architecture Oops <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did not think to hedge its x bet with a smaller division focused on RISC architecture That has proven to be a very costly mistake Now the new President of the IoT group Venkata Murthy Renduchintala has pushed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to capitulate on the x architecture for mobile essentially declaring defeat to RISC architecture after spending more than billion trying to catch up in the mobile market Prior to the mobile revolution everybody that wanted to connect to the internet had to have a PC and the vast majority of PCs were powered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as an effective monopoly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>extracted monopoly pricing for a single product the CPU that was excessively powerful and overpriced for the majority of tasks it was performing for the majority of consumers The full power of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU is way more than most people need for daily tasks and connectivity yet they had no choice but to pay the monopoly price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did some market segmentation with Celeron and other lower end processors but it was all based on the x architecture which consumes a lot of power and produces a lot of heat By virtue of its monopoly power <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could set the profit maximizing price for each market segment and the cash flow was practically certain The PC is now a dying industry as tablets smartphones and RISC based laptops and devices cannibalize the market that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>dominated for more than two decades The PC itself will eventually die off as a form factor but it may take a long time of slow decline as the ecosystem of apps and connected form factors continues to develop for both general ie smartphone and specific ie enterprise purposes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls will point to the growth in data center demand and its ability to offset declining PC revenues However virtualization and cloud efficiencies lowers the demand for processing power for the same tasks that a PC would normally do In addition the overall demand for data centers pales in comparison to the personal computing market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is used to selling oversized overpriced CPUs for every PC this type of monopoly power cannot be maintained in the Datacenter business Competition in the data center market is set to be fierce as ARM based processors continue pushing into the lucrative space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cannot defend against this attack on its cash cow by continuing to push Moores law It is no longer a relevant force we dont need more raw processing power we need smarter and more efficient processing Moores law is not the cure for Intels sickness and investing CapEx purely in the pursuit of achieving Moores law is a gross misallocation of capital Mr Market is unsure how to price INTC With the dividend and cash flow relatively safe in the near term the stock price has a floor under it but an erosion of their core market and pricing power will hurt stockholders down the road <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is wedded to the x architecture and it is still their cash cow Without the ability to cannibalize their own product they will have to acquire the technology to compete in mobile and IoT and they will have to pay a large premium to do so Given that they blew through billion to fail at mobile I would not rule a large acquisition However it will likely be value destroying for shareholders as there is no guarantee that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can move fast enough into new markets to offset the decline of PCs At this point I would say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a dinosaur headed to extinction Just like the dinosaurs extinction wont be immediate but it could be fast The asteroid has already struck and the long dark winter is setting in for the PC era <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will go down with it Disclosure Iwe have no
