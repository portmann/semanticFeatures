estimate was worse than expected Well get quarterly results from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC on Wednesday afternoon Unfortunately for investors the PC industry appears to be quite weak again and warnings have come in fast and furious <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>analysts continue to lower their estimates and the expectation seems to be that the company will reduce its forecast this week Today the key question seems to be not if well receive bad news from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but how much bad news will we get There werent a lot of high hopes for Q The stronger dollar has resulted in higher PC prices overseas hurting demand Also we saw a bump this time last year due to the end of Windows XP support sending quarterly comparison figures higher Add in the fact that Windows is about to launch and inventory levels are being reduced IDC is estimating that PC sales fell year over year in Q about a percentage point worse than originally thought Gartner is a little less pessimistic only calling for a decline For the full year both research firms are looking for low to mid single digit PC sales declines Expectations for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cratered after the companys big Q warning back in March At that point analysts were looking for revenue growth this year and EPS growth Estimates came down and at the companys Q report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guided to approximately flat revenues for In addition to the negative estimate out of IDC weve seen a number of negative reports from other players in the space detailed below June th Micron NASDAQ MU falls after miss and weak guidance July th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>slumps after QLogic NASDAQ QLGC issues Q warning With so many warnings coming from the space it probably is not a surprise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>estimates have come down As I mentioned in my previous article on the name the average revenue estimate was below the companys Q revenue guidance midpoint for billion As of Sunday analysts have become even more negative with the average Q estimate now at billion Thats the lowest point that Ive seen Analysts also expect a cent decline in EPS from the prior year period which isnt too surprising given the expectation for a decline in YY revenues I think the more important part of this weeks report will be Intels full year forecast Management usually doesnt give numerical guidance for revenues using words instead So if the company does decide to reduce its yearly forecast Ill be looking for something like low single digit revenue decline or mid single digit revenue decline The chart below shows how much the analyst revenue estimate average has come down since the Q warning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>analysts are now looking for revenues to decline by this year or almost billion It is clear that analysts are looking for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to reduce its forecast this year because I wouldnt call a nearly billion sales decline to mesh with guidance for approximately flat revenues On the EPS front analysts are looking for down from last year Management will have plenty of questions to answer on the conference call especially after the surprising recent executive shakeup which included the departure of CFO Renee James With the expectation that revenues will be lower than previously forecast Im interested to see how much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can cut costs The company has an ongoing restructuring program and the capex forecast was slashed a few months ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants to save every penny possible given its pending purchase of Altera NASDAQ ALTR that will cost somewhere around billion Hopefully for the company interest rates will stay fairly low given the expectation for the Altera deal to be heavily financed with debt When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reports this week there is an expectation that well get some bad news The key question is how much Analysts expect revenues this year to decline by about basically meaning that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is expected to lower its revenue forecast The Q data points weve seen have not been pretty and a number of names have already warned On the positive side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares have come down a bit so I figure a good chunk of this weakness is priced in As I mentioned in my previous article the stocks valuation at less than times expected EPS is rather fair and the dividend yield is now above Ill be back after earnings to discuss Intels Q report Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Preparing For Bad News Disclosure Iwe
