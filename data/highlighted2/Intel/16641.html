Apple TV Ask Why Not When Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Following Apples promise of new products and the HBO Now announcement there have been an increasing number of predictions for new Apple TV hardware After studying Apples product history and digital video trends there are few reasons for new Apple TV hardware anytime soon Lack of new hardware should not matter to investors The growth of Ultra HD content and DRM will necessitate new hardware There are also opportunities for a new model or a completely new product Even before the iPhone release Tim Cook had been teasing that new products will be coming from Apple NASDAQ AAPL this year After the announcement of HBO Now many are predicting andor hoping for a new Apple TV hardware model The current thirdgeneration Apple TV was launched in March of That is ancient by technology standards and overdue for an update Yet it still does everything perfectly today And the last time Apple released a new product because it was due for an update was never Why would there be a new Apple TV History and technology give few reasons Steve Jobs famously described Apple TV as a hobby despite his perhaps less famous insistence on laserlike focus The guy just did not DO hobbies It was clear to everyone at the time that video would go digital just like music had It was also clear that the movie industry had watched the Internet nearly destroy the record labels business and would not let it happen the same way to them Apple TV was a way for the company to gather firsthand information and by participating help shape the market for digital video Behind all the famously stylish marketing Apple is very disciplined about new products They only make products that can be great products And only release them when the product the technology and the market are ready Everyone knows the iPod wasnt the first MP player Instead Apple released it at a time when everyone wanted digital music and digital music was a disaster Described as the first MP player worth owning iPod and iTunes were the first to provide an easy way for people to play store and buy their music digitally When the iPhone first launched nearly everyone had a cell phone And as Jobs observed they hated it The iPhone was not new technology it was a new user experience And it was great Apple Pay hit more specific market timing which was not directly about users There were rumors of NFC on the iPhone for many years along with predictions of how Apple could leverage the millions of users with credit cards on file at the iTunes store So why finally in Apple Pay would only work with newer pointofsale terminals and a new industry requirement would force the majority of retailers to replace theirs within the next year Note also that music players smartphones and electronic payments are markets big enough to matter to Apple Apple TV is arguably the best purchased content experience for digital video It links and extends many parts of the Apple ecosystem by seamlessly bringing all of a users iTunes content into the living room and extending a Mac or iPad display onto a big screen So its already a great product Apples products are priced to deliver value and also generate great margins for the company Since a streaming video box will never have a premium price cost is critical and Apple has worked hard on that side of the equation The secondgeneration hardware was a major cost reduction by using flash chips in place of a hard drive and replacing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC processor and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA graphics with the A SoC also used in the iPhone and iPad The thirdgeneration Apple TV was only released after p TVs and content started to become common It was built with a version of Apples dualcore A processor shared with iPad and iPod Touch capable of decoding h video at p The A in Apple TV however had one core disabled Since Apple TV only uses one core this appears to have been a daring move to lower costs through increased yields Later Apple quietly switched to a singlecore version of the A Presumably this was after yields improved and Apple TV sales volume justified a design unique to Apple TV Apple TV is no longer a hobby Cordcutting has become mainstream Cable companies have more internet subscribers than TV subscribers Netflix NASDAQ NFLX has more viewers than several major broadcast networks And nearly all of those networks have started offering their shows directly online in addition to platforms like iTunes Hulu and Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN The iTunes store was obviously key to the success of iPod Less obvious was that this integration provided seamless digital rights management DRM which was critical to the music labels participation DRM is integral to Apple TV as well since HDMI is the only video port and it carries DRM for HD digital video in the form of HDCP Today Ultra HD or k video is becoming common both content and hardware And there is new HDCP to protect it with DRM The current Apple TV hardware is not adequate for either of these Since UHD content with HDCP is not backwards compatible with older TVs or devices support will be critical for the future of Apple TV Apple does not create separate products to compete at lower price points like other manufacturers The recent price drop to matches their approach of shifting older hardware models to lower price points which could be an indicator that a new Apple TV model is coming Readers will recall though that repricing of iPad and iPhone models happened when new ones were announced The Worldwide Developer Conference WWDC is where Apple announces new software and SDKs for app developers Support for HomeKit and Family Sharing are already in the latest OS beta for Apple TV so their addition seems inevitable and likely to happen at WWDC Consider that the HomeKit features in beta are only a relay for other devices Dont be disappointed if WWDC does not include new hardware to support HomeKit or other features With storage and processing power comparable to iPad an upgrade is not really necessary for streaming services or even thirdparty apps Investors should be excited about updates and improvements to Apple TV even without it Apple TV is brilliant for being a powerful driver of the halo effect across much of the Apple product ecosystem yet one of Apples least expensive products And the addition of HomeKit will let developers determine whether Apple TV will become the new hub for the Internet of Things Should that happen it could create the opportunity for a great new premium product For now Apple TV is all about accessing content Currently under of the total iTunes content is the fastestgrowing component of Apple company revenue And while Steve Jobs and the realitydistortion field that brought record labels into the iTunes Store are now gone the acquisition of Beats Music brought Johnny Iovine and his entertainment industry connections Since then HBO Now has been added and Apple is widely rumored to be in negotiations with many other content providers It may be the first Apple product where the hardware doesnt matter Source New Apple TV Ask
