Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article A recent accounting change at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>confirms management commentary over the past year that the cadence for new nodes is moving from to years This could actually be beneficial for shareholders as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can squeeze more chips out of existing capital equipment benefiting cash flow Intels competitive position continues to be strong as Moores Law has historically operated on a longer cadence anyway and these issues are not Intelspecific When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC reported earnings last week there werent too many surprises DCG growth once again came in below the number management keeps guiding to but this has happened so many times before its old hat by now Commentary on weakness in China sent the stock down but thats also not terribly surprising with whats going on over there As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment lengthens we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our factories from four to five years This change in depreciable life drives approximately billion in lower depreciation expense for the year Inclusive of this change we are forecasting depreciation expense to be billion this year down billion from At many firms a change in the economic life of manufacturing equipment would be a minor accounting detail At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand its hugely meaningful Im actually surprised it hasnt drawn more attention Those who follow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are undoubtedly familiar with Moores Law Given the challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has experienced with nm many have been questioning whether the traditional twoyear tick tock cadence was sustainable Indeed last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich telegraphed that the transition to nm would take years as well but the company was on the fence about whether the transitions would be on a or year basis as recently as December At the Credit Suisse conference Krzanich explained whats going on The number of mask layers has more than doubled over the last five years so it takes longer to do developments it takes longer to do defect reduction So thats whats happened here I believe over the next five years lithography tools will start to catch up Well see whether it stays at twoandahalf years or we can get it back to two years were going to keep pushing back to two years if we can With the accounting change from years to years of depreciation though it is now officially Intels position that the cadence has elongated from months to Stacy on the call last week We did an indepth analysis based on the cadence of moving from one process technology node to the next We talked about that at the beginning of and the third wave of products And we completed our longrange planning in the fourth quarter and thats what triggered the change in the depreciation cadence From a direct financial standpoint the change in depreciation will boost gross margins by a point in In the longer term this likely means capex spending will be a smaller percentage of revenue as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ekes more chips out of the same process node This is actually great from a cash flow perspective The question that many have raised is whether or not this signals an erosion of Intels historical process technology lead over TSMC NYSE TSM and Samsung OTCSSNLF I believe not for three reasons First the challenges of and beyond are not Intelspecific and the companys advantage includes many things material science D transistors etc in addition to just the headline nanomenter number Second if you take a little longerterm view of history Moores law has actually operated on a longer cadence over much of its history As Krzanich explained at the Credit Suisse conference The first thing you said it John Moores Law is years old and if you take a look at the history of Moores Law its not spent much of its life at twoyear cycles Actually the majority of its life has been years to years Sunlin Chou who used to run our TD department drove it to two years during a very unique opportunity unique time when lithography tools were progressing quite nicely and thats when steppers really came into fashion and the wavelengths of light were going down nicely Basically whats slowing down Moores Law is two things right now The EUV is late it should have probably come in optimally some people argue at nanometers I actually argue probably at nanometers out in that timeframe Thats really when we started to need EUV when were multi patterning and what that does is it extends the length of the process Third I am quite fond of the following graphic from this McKinsey report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has long been one of the few standouts in semiconductors As I discussed in my last article the tone has shifted under Krzanich The company is keenly aware of the missteps that left it somewhat on the sidelines in mobile and appears to be making investments in all the right areas to ensure that its competitive position remains strong I continue to think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is wellmanaged and a longer cadence for moving to new nodes may actually be beneficial for cash flow to shareholders I dont own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>today because I have better opportunities in smallcaps that are less exposed to global economic ups and downs but I continue to think the valuation here is reasonable relative to other largecaps and certainly more attractive prospectively than something like IBM NYSE IBM which despite the cheap valuation doesnt seem worth buying At the right price Id be happy to be an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholder again
