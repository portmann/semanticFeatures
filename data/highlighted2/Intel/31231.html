Q On The Ropes Yet Again Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD is gloomier than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>about a PC recovery in the second half of Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD may still have million in cash left to burn but if something does not turn around soon extinction is in the cards Generally the market for CPUs and GPUs graphics processors is stronger in the second half of each year with Q being seasonally strongest Q did show a profit of million GAAP million adjusted but that quarter was swamped by other losses in Right now it looks like will be even worse There are a few possible future bright spots I will discuss but on the whole todays selloff in AMD stock seems justified The PC end market has been in decline for years now In there was a slight boost as Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT ended support for Windows XP an ancient but apparently beloved OS So AMD and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC are fighting over a declining market with margins in some price segments so low that AMD is abandoning them At times AMD has done better against graphics rival Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA but saw newer Nvidia GPUs introduced that topped those available from AMD That resulted in both market share and price erosion as well as unsold inventory accumulating at channel partners Q was largely about allowing the channel inventory to unwind The result was that the Computing and Graphics segment had revenue of million That was sequentially down which is more than the usual postholiday drop More significant was a yy drop Thats a disaster Most likely AMD lost market share to both Nvidia and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>within a shrinking market Commercial as opposed to consumer sales were up yy No breakdown was given but AMD has always been mainly a producer for the consumer market I suspect that if the AMD share of the business PC market ever became substantial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would simply lower CPU prices to constrain AMDs growth This has been Intels basic business strategy against AMD throughout their history AMDs presence in the tablet market is insignificant except for some in devices AMD does not produce chips for cell phones The next generation of AMD PC chips is called Carrizo Doubtless they are an improvement on prior chips but they are going up against the newest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips Maintaining market share is the best that can be expected after any shortterm bump from their introduction The possibility of a burst in console sales with the introduction of Xbox and PlayStation to the Chinese market did not materialize It is still worth watching the ramp as gaming consoles could yet catch on there Nor did a price reduction by Microsoft do more than just keep it competitive with Sony NYSE SNE and maybe clear out some inventory AMD offers no breakdown but it is fair to assume that the bulk of revenue in the Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom segment comes from chips for gaming consoles Segment revenue for Q was million down sequentially and from a year earlier The yy decline was because gaming console chip revenue was down from Q This segment is where any hope for AMD lies A number of wins occurred in the quarter which could result in higher revenue later in Unnamed new embedded APU CPU GPU on a single chip based products were introduced by Samsung OTCSSNLF GE NYSE GE and Fujitsu OTCPKFJTSY AMD FreeSync technology is now being offered in displays from Acer BenQ and LG Electronics but AMD is not charging royalties for that The segment overall showed million of operating profit Responding to a question from an analyst CEO Lisa Su reported that the two major semicustom wins that were announced in late are still on schedule to start generating revenue in SeaMicro was a maker of ultradense servers founded in AMD bought it for million in and for a couple of years it was touted as a promising area The funny thing was it sold mostly servers that were populated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips While no details were given by AMD management I suspect SeaMicro customers no more wanted AMD Opteron chips than anyone else In any case AMD closed it on April Apparently it was not worth selling or could not be sold without parting with something called fabric technology which AMD is incorporating into its next generation of server chips AMDs inability to compete in server chips with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has seriously undermined its financial model over the last five or so years AMD gained some market share when it introduced Opteron processors but since then has shrunk to less than of the market at a time when that market has grown substantially along with cloud services Server chips have better margins than PC chips so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a cash cow where AMD has next to nothing at the moment If AMD has an ace in the hole it is the Opteron A This is a bit ARM processor SoC that incorporates other crucial components of server technology that may not be available to AMDs ARMbased competitors It is being tested by potential customers and semicustom versions may later be made available to sufficiently large cloud customers But there is nothing that guarantees sufficient customer adoption to make it a profitable business Nothing prevents <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>from taking out an ARM license and competing in this area if it turns out to be viable as happened after Opteron server chips were introduced AMD lost million on a GAAP basis in Q or per share On a nonGAAP basis the loss was million or negative In addition to the usual noncash differences between GAAP and nonGAAP a big contributor to the difference was a million noncash impairment charge on the SeaMicro closure Q guidance was not reassuring Q is typically seasonally up in revenue from Q it was up in For Q AMD is guiding to revenue between flat and down This was attributed to the continued need to get excess inventory out of partner channels The good news is that process should conclude in Q so that growth can resume in Q Of course if the PC market continues to shrink despite the Windows introduction Q could be disappointing too Regarding the second half in response to a question from an analyst comparing Intels statement that seasonality would be better than normal due to the release of Windows during the summer Lisa Su refused to go with the better than instead predicting a seasonally better second half in part due to the release of Windows AMD cant be blamed for poor yy gaming console sales or the shrinking PC market AMD is right to concentrate RD dollars on the Enterprise and Embedded segment But there are no guarantees that this strategy will work AMD needs to keep its Computing and Graphics segment because it needs the efficiencies of scale and because some RD costs benefit both segments It is possible the PC market will stabilize Desktops still offer the best value for doing work where a large screen and ample processing power are needed and there are indeed a lot of ancient desktops and notebooks out in the world that should be replaced However for consumers desktops and notebooks are increasingly optional and it is the consumer market that AMD has always served The embedded SoCs project is doing relatively well with some promise of a bump in That leaves the gaming console business the crucial factor in Maybe it will grow especially if some great games are introduced But my sense is that gaming consoles are another industry in slow decline I own AMD stock which is a legacy from when my portfolio was almost exclusively in the information technology segment I would not buy any AMD now given what I know Im willing to keep what I have to see if maybe ARM server chips gaming console sales and other embedded and customized chip applications work out according to the AMD game plan But if I decide I need cash AMD is now on my short list
