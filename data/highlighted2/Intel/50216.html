Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reportedly offered to buy Altera for a share If an acquisition were to occur there could be cost synergies through higher utilization of older fabs and reduction in overlapping costs Despite the cost synergies its not exactly clear whether FPGAs are going to generate enough growth to merit the acquisition premium If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were to acquire Altera theres the potential for value destruction Despite that reality Intels other business units will absorb the downside from overpaying The reports of an Altera NASDAQ ALTR and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC merger are a little unsettling so I decided to do additional research on the topic as I believe the two companies could have some synergies Admittedly I dont know everything about field programmable gate arrays other than the fact that theyre very useful and reprogrammable via a hardware design language or HDL for short Theres a decent likelihood that these reports are accurate however the upside from such a deal isnt exactly clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the CPU and GPU business and it tends to stay away from FPGAs The addition of FPGAs gives the combined company a separate lineup of ICs to market and sell Admittedly developing the kind of capabilities inhouse would cost a lot of money and would take a lot of time Hence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems willing to pay a premium to buy out Altera On the one hand the deal on the table sounds pretty generous Despite the generous offer Altera had refused the deal earlier in the year according to earlier reports This has resulted in quite a bit of controversy especially from institutional investors who wanted the immediate exit plan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp in a deal likely to top billion according to a source familiar with the matter making it Intels biggest purchase ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector The acquisition of Altera which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers the military and other industrial applications would underscore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanichs determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam The deal could be sensible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders While it will take a while to make the deal accretive theres potential to create value postacquisition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would obviously have to explain to shareholders how it will go about accomplishing this But in the meantime Im going to try and make a couple educated guesses Alteras FPGAs tend to win designs at the older process nodes So my guess is that the cost to performance is maximized on older manufacturing technology which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is so worked up over the deal because it gives some of its older fabs higher utilization rates This will lead to better rates of profitability due to higher gross margins So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could potentially increase the gross margin and operating margins of Altera It also may have a way of bundling FPGAs with its serverclass CPUs so it gives enterprise users more customizability with their data centers Admittedly these are all very hypothetical situations When working off of consensus analyst estimates Altera is expected to report a decline in EPS of around With a forward EPS of the buyout price of implies a forward price earnings multiple of Its not clear whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to generate enough value from this deal to merit the high valuation that its going to pay Prior to news reports of Intels interest in acquiring Altera the median sellside research price target was with the majority of price targets between and In a levered share repurchase scenario we believe the company is worth to per share Given the deep cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the need for a strong balance sheet throughout the cycle we believe it is unlikely that a levered share repurchase would ultimately be executed As it relates to prospective revenues from Stratix we are optimistic that Altera will benefit considerably over the next few years as ondie FPGA volumes begin to significantly penetrate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>server volumes but adjusted for risk and time value we do not see this opportunity contributing more than per share of incremental value even in our more optimistic models for Altera Prior to learning of the disappointing Q earnings results and guidance we viewed a standalone valuation range of to as appropriate for the Company TIG Capital While Im still optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I dont see this deal moving the stock by much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may be overpaying as Altera in isolation isnt going to generate enough organic growth to start being accretive for perhaps five years as the threeyear target price is mids based on various commentary from sellside research firms Also growth is heavily dependent on the business cycle and on new technological developments which have yet to be identified For example FPGAs are extremely useful because modifications to the hardware design language allows for high efficiency in narrow uses cases While FPGAs are useful theres no indication that Altera is the most dominant in that market as there are competing providers like Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX and Samsung OTC SSNLF Then theres also the fact that data centers primarily revolve around general purpose computing So in narrow use cases the FPGA does become pretty useful but the costtobenefit isnt simply there for multipurpose applications Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making an investment into a nascent business opportunity Im all for these types of acquisitions but the return on investment isnt very well defined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors should be wondering if this is the best path forward as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could use billion on share buybacks instead If in the event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were to acquire Altera I would still recommend the stock but thats because its growth opportunity in storage mobile and data centers offsets the potential downside from engaging in this acquisition Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be
