Who Are You Kidding Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD expects to turn nonGAAP profitable in H Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD released quarterly numbers Thursday after hours The market was encouraged by the strong numbers and even more enthused by the strong guidance for Q and profit expectations in second half of the year AMDs President and CEO Lisa T Su also announced the intellectual property licensing agreement and joint venture with THATIC to cater to the Chinese server market You can read the complete earnings call transcript on Seeking Alpha Here is some info about the JV with THATIC that has got the stock all heated up AMD has licensed its highperformance processor and SoC technology in a JV with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co Ltd to develop systemonchips SoCs to cater to the Chinese server market The licensing arrangement is worth million and the payments are contingent upon the JV reaching certain reaching certain milestones Such fundamental developments and the strong subsequent rallies have been a part of the long history of AMD But they have only resulted in disappointment for even the most prolific investors Many a times promise seen in AMDs products and technology has led analysts and brokerage firms to believe that a turnaround will occur and that we are being too negative on the stock However the monthly stock price chart clearly puts things into perspective Bears have won this battle for long Owing to the strong momentum that is being witnessed I would not be surprised if the stock even rallied to per share but it would take very constructive measures to take the stock higher than that To start with a higher gross margin in the range of would be great The company is banking on Zen to drive its gross margin higher The company expects to become nonGAAP profitable in the second half of this year this is another thing that is spurring a deadcat bounce in the stock But I would like to see some consistency before I would become too interested Yes I am inclined towards playing a little safe here so I might or will miss out on big gains if they come One thing I must mention here is that there is no definite timeline to get the commercial products in the Chinese market with the IP licensing and JV agreement Therefore it may very well become possible that the half of million which is expected in the next couple of years may get postponed The company has recognized million of the payment in Q and expects to recognize million for entire Over the first two years the company expects to receive about half of the licensing payments upon completion of some development milestones AMD has three design wins with lifetime revenue of billion expected to be recognized in the next years The company acknowledges that the revenue recognized per year will increase to a steady state from next year onwards But achieving the milestones is the key What the investors should be cautiously watching is the sharp decline in EESC revenue especially the SemiCustom contribution and the managements attitude about it In the earnings call Lisa T Su said Our strategy to improve our business by gaining share in the Graphics and PC markets growing our SemiCustom business and expanding into the datacenter market is progressing as planned But the combined revenue of Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom segments has declined by more than YoY and by QoQ Does it look like a business improving in the targeted segment Lower desktop processor sales have negatively impacted the companys CG segment however the effect has been reduced by lower OpEx AMD has consistently lost its market share to its rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC which has been ahead for the past several years Stronger sales better marketing and product execution from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have pushed AMD to multiyear lows A declining PC market is another pain that AMD has been unable to get rid of And I do not expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to go soft anytime soon nor do I expect the declining PC or desktop sales trend to reverse Even in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was first to bring its data center infrastructure And they will definitely up their game to give AMD a run for its money I would also like to see if the management can fulfill its promises Any revenue growth in the next quarter will be more pronounced because of the lower base effect and seasonality Investors should not rush to buy AMD as of now There is too much speculation and that is not what an investor wants Most of the positives will be priced into the stock today and it may reach stratospheric levels Wait to see if the growth actually comes it is not a growth story as of now and is highly risky Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Technology Semiconductor Broad Line Earnings </div></body></html>
