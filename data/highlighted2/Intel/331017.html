in an accident Durcan took over the next day Superstar investors Seth Klarman of Baupost and David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital were among Microns largest investors Baupost now holds only a million shares Greenlight has no position at all Baupost believes Micron will widen its cost disadvantage relative to Samsung in DRAM I strongly disagree Microns nm ramp will be quickly followed up by a nm ramp By the end of calendar year Microns costbit will be roughly on par with that of Samsung and costbit in D NAND to be ahead of the field <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron are not breaking up They are becoming more dependent upon each other While still unlikely an IntelMicron merger is way more likely than a breakup When Micron investors hear about Microns NASDAQ MU management a general sense of disappointment fills the room The cast of characters has changed quite a bit over the last year Former CFO Ron Foster resigned and was replaced by Ernie Maddock Kipp Bedard who has served as VP of Investor Relations since retired in January Bedard was succeeded by Microns longtime Senior Director of Investor Relations Ivan Donaldson President Mark Adams resigned due to health reasons earlier this month Micron has had a tendency of promoting veterans from within the company to its executive ranks CFO Ernie Maddock has been a notable exception While Ron Foster Kipp Bedard and Mark Adams have caused some general resentment among Micron investors over the last few years sometimes fairly sometimes not Mark Durcan as CEO of the company is most frequently blamed for the downfall of Microns stock in my view The two guys in Microns management team that I would like to focus this article on are CEO Mark Durcan and CFO Ernie Maddock The story of how Durcan ended up becoming the CEO of the Boisebased semiconductor giant is one that involves tragedy striking in a small window of time Durcan a veteran of the company for over years started working at the firm as a Process Integration Engineer He held many titles as he rose through the ranks at Micron including VP of RD President and Chief Operating Officer On January Durcan announced his plans to retire at the end of August Mark Adams was slated to take over as president and COO of the firm At that time Microns CEO and Chairman Steve Appleton spoke fondly of Durcans tenure at Micron Appleton stated For the past years Mark has played an integral role in the companys growth and success He also said We appreciate his willingness to serve through the remainder of the fiscal year to ensure a smooth transition of his duties to his successor We will miss Marks leadership and guidance and wish him well in his future endeavors Durcans plans took a degree turn a week later On February Appleton died in a plane crash Appleton was an aviation enthusiast and adrenaline junkie He began his career after college at Micron in At the age of and years of experience he ascended to the role of CEO and Chairman of the Board of Micron This is a close to unbelievable accomplishment at a major semiconductor company not in its infancy After successfully leading the company through multiple violent memory cycles that included numerous bankruptcies and mergers for a little less than two decades finding someone to fill those shoes was an unenviable task Only a few weeks before Durcan was set to ride into the proverbial sunset an unfortunate accident put him in position to ascend to the position he likely coveted but was unlikely to ever get as Appleton was a rather young yearold expected to lead the company for potentially another decade and beyond Had the accident occurred several months later or perhaps even just several weeks later when Durcan would already be comfortably relaxing in retirement perhaps Mark Adams a Harvard MBA without an accompanying engineering degree or a Micron insider with an engineering background would have become CEO of the firm Theres a possibility that an outsider from another semiconductor giant such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK or Samsung OTCSSNLF could have stepped into the role Theres no doubt that Steve Appleton would have remained CEO for as long as he wanted had he not been on that plane With the timeline of events as they occurred it is hard to imagine that Microns list of candidates for the CEO position extended much beyond Durcans name Despite the fact that there was almost certainly no plan to ever allow Durcan to be the man in charge of Micron prior to April he was quickly named CEO the day after Appletons death Praise is heaped upon a CEO when a public companys financials look great future prospects appear promising and the stock price rises Unsurprisingly a CEO is vilified when results go the other way This occurs whether the CEOs decisions are the primary driver that led to success or failure While the fall in DRAM prices can be largely attributed to external factors out of the hands of Durcans reach the cost per bit of producing DRAM can be controlled by Microns decisions While it is clear that the nm ramp at Samsung and SK Hynix OTCHXSCF was difficult Micron began the ramp on nm much later than its rivals and the process has been excruciatingly slow As a result of producing DRAM at nm and nm nodes while the competition was ramping nm Microns cost per bit for producing DRAM has been significantly higher than that of its Korean foes Based on my conversations with friends engineers who have worked at Micron it is clear that Mark Durcan is respected within the doors of Microns facilities in Boise After all he was the technical expert at Micron during the era when significant RD led to D NAND D XPoint and other products He is one of them As Bobcat noted in this comment had the CEO of Micron been a sales and marketing guy like Mark Adams EE types would likely have unleashed unyielding diatribes that demanded his ouster immediately if he steered the ship that has led Micron to its current state There were no serious objections at the last vote to keep Durcan on board as CEO I can understand why However is going to be a year when Micron has to deliver The fabled D NAND is here It is time to show its the real deal and prove that there is a clear path to cost leadership by the second generation D NAND in On the DRAM front Micron has to speed up its ramp on nm and be on the heels of Samsung with a nm ramp as soon as Samsung moves toward nm It is alright if ends up being a bloodbath so long as Durcan can show Samsung that advancing process nodes in the future for DRAM will have no hope of yielding excess profits If all of this does not occur and theres significant risk of at least one of these events failing to materialize I strongly believe investors will begin to clamor for his removal I have mixed feelings about Durcan as CEO but I generally favor the idea of having someone new replace him Ernie Maddock is the first breath of fresh air to enter Microns executive ranks in a while At a time when significant capital expenditures will be required over multiple years a major acquisition in the works and multiple hedgeable risks emerge the value of the CFO position at Micron has perhaps hit an all time high When investing in smallcap companies I believe looking at insider trading activity particularly those with a capital C in their title is important Its less important to me when looking at an established company with well over billion of annual sales While there are many reasons a company executive may sell shares of the company he works at there is only one reason to buy shares in the open market Ill just copy an excerpt from a previous article I wrote that describes his trading activity of Microns stock Maddock has made three open market purchases of Microns stock He bought shares at share in July He followed that up with a purchase of shares in December at share As the price of the stock has fallen quite a bit more since then Maddock accumulated another shares at a little under share Maddock has repeated the message that there will be a significant turnaround in the second half of FY In this case he has put his money where his mouth is Unfortunately it appears that Micron is headed toward a slow beginning of the second half of the fiscal year again This article might more appropriately be called Micron Management and Former Investors I believe looking at most D F and G filings is a waste of time However there exists a small group of investors whose opinions mean something to me At or near the top of the list includes David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Seth Klarman of Baupost In the world of hedge funds these two are the equivalent of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird for those over Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon for those over or LeBron James and Stephen Curry for those just getting out of college When a book ebook is written a century from now about the greatest investors of all time it is highly likely that these two will be held in high esteem As of the end of third quarter Baupost added to its stake in Micron and held a total of about million shares Over the last months the fund led by Klarman has significantly trimmed its position Baupost sold over of its shares of Micron and held only million shares of the company at the end of As of the end of the second quarter Greenlight Capital had built its position in Micron to just under million shares Over the following six months the fund under Einhorn liquidated its entire position in Micron Overall both funds earned significant profits by investing in Micron Jim Mooney of Baupost explained why the fund had significantly reduced its stake in Micron Mooney wrote Our loss on Micron resulted from the fact that we remained overly optimistic about our longterm thesis after it should have become apparent that the companys widening cost disadvantage compared to its largest competitor Samsung Electronics would result in lower than expected profit margins It also should have been clearer to us that the company was more vulnerable to the decline in PC DRAM pricing than we had believed By the time we decided to sell nearly all of our remaining position the stock was lower a frustrating coda to an otherwise tremendously successful investment that achieved total lifetime profitability of over M I wrote about Einhorns line of reasoning in a previous article on why he liquidated Greenlights entire stake in the fund To summarize Einhorn believes the cyclical nature of DRAM will remain and he missed seeing the peak and the turn in the cycle He believes the historical patterns of memory companys overinvesting in anticipation of future demand will continue DRAM and NAND pricing also failed to meet his expectations in He also talked about the risk of a DRAM manufacturer emerging from China and the enormous capital expenditures that Micron has planned over the next few years These two are living legends I admire them more than I probably should In this case I strongly disagree with both of them Microns cost disadvantage in manufacturing DRAM is quickly narrowing as it is likely just a singledigit number of weeks away from bit crossover on nm DRAM Whats interesting to note is that Microns team of Japanese engineers former employees of Elpida which was acquired by Micron and Microns American counterparts will collaborate on advancing to a new process node together for the first time on the X transition Micron has struggled more than its Korean competitors on the nm transition This time around Micron is keeping within striking distance of Samsung and Micron has the potential to match its rival as the cost per bit leader in DRAM manufacturing over the next months Well at least that is the hope of Micron longs like myself On the surface a race to shrink process nodes is bad news for the industry However cooler heads will eventually prevail once it becomes apparent to everyone that further shrinks will be immediately met with counterattacks that will prevent any opportunity to achieve above industry average gross margins in DRAM The threat of advancing to Y will exist but Y will be put on hold When all three world powers I am speaking of Samsung Hynix and Micron here have access to launch nuclear attacks on each other I suspect they all will choose a more peaceful route that leads to greater stability and profitability During the QA session of the Winter Analyst Day conference Micron management noted that the X process node enablement for DRAM is a high priority during the year It also seems that the company intends to ramp this technology much sooner than many had imagined Micron indicated that in the cases where the nm to nm transition was not complete it is likely that Micron may immediately upgrade nm lines to nm ones Considering where Micron currently is on the nm ramp that puts the timeline of when DRAM bits using the nm process node will start appearing at sometime during calendar year There is a small chance that we could see nm DRAM bits at the tail end of FY or early FY Samsung expects to begin mass production of DRAM on the nm process node sometime around the middle of the year If Micron ramps nm when I expect assuming Samsung begins an aggressive action toward migrating to nm Micron will achieve cost parity with Samsung on DRAM in months Achieving cost parity in DRAM and a cost per bit edge in D NAND is a distinct possibility for Micron in the second half of calendar year The last topic I want to mention is the relationship between Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a vested interest in the success of Micron In Stephen Breezys Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Occams Razor Breezy states his belief that Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are going through a messy breakup I strongly disagree with this assessment On the contrary I believe Micron and Intels relationship is growing stronger and their dependence on each other is increasing Occams Razor in short states that the hypothesis that utilizes the fewest assumptions is preferable over one that uses requires more assumptions I will apply Occams Razor to the current and future relationship of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have a long relationship of working on research and development efforts together The story of the relationship between these two companies began in with the formation of their joint venture IM Flash Here is a timeline of some of the major events of this joint venture There have been three major developments created by this union of two of Americas semiconductor giants These three developments in chronological order of when they were revealed to the public are planar NAND D NAND and D XPoint Planar NAND profits have been disappointing and this technology is quickly on its way to obsolescence The D NAND ramp has begun and bit crossover with planar NAND is only a couple months away The further scaling of D NAND in the zdimension has not begun yet and the pace of the drop in cost per bit will accelerate over the next two years D XPoint was jointly developed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron and we are still at least several months away from seeing it in action and at least a few years away before the technology starts to mature into a multibillion dollar profit stream It seems inconceivable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron could be working on a divorce after spending billions and plans to spend billions more to develop and build capacity for their two landmark breakthrough technologies before they even see meaningful sales from either technology On top of Micron and Intels joint effort in nonvolatile memories the two also have worked on developing MCDRAM a variant of the fabled HMC Hybrid Memory Cube to be used as the highbandwidth onpackage memory solution of Intels Xeon Phi In Microns most recent Q there is an interesting note on page The IMFT joint venture agreement extends through and includes certain buysell rights On January we amended the Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>related to the IMFT joint venture to change the dates of those buysell rights Pursuant to this amendment commencing in January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can put to us and commencing in January we can call from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Intels interest in IMFT in either case for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at such time If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>elects to sell to us we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for one to two years from the closing date This effectively pushes back the dates in their previous agreement by one year which guarantees the relationship will remain intact for at least one additional year beyond than what was implied in the previous deal And to be clear I expect Micron and Intels relationship will expand and extend beyond <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron jointly develop technology but also potentially compete against each other in the marketplace That creates an unusual dynamic where some profitmotivated actions by either party will be perceived as a move toward a breakup At a Raymond James conference in September the now retired Kipp Bedard VP of Investor Relations at Micron at the time stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was possibly looking to manufacture D NAND separately from its joint venture with Micron The news of Intels planned investment in Dalian should not have been shocking In a previous article I stated that Intels desires to build additional fab capacity before the Dalian announcement as not a sign of a breakdown in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron partnership This is a result of Intels expectation of demand for D XPoint and D NAND to be so high that Microns wafer capacity will be completely exhausted well before it is able to produce enough wafers to meet the markets huge demand for these two new nonvolatile memories That is the ultimate bullish statement and bodes extremely well for Microns longterm prospects if reality is anywhere close to Intels expectations Micron and Intels relationship is analogous to that of longtime best friends and business partners The businesses are getting more intertwined over time By applying Occams Razor the conclusion to draw using the fewest number of assumptions is that the two will continue their fruitful relationship It is far more likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will acquire an equity stake in Micron than it is for the two to split up While unlikely the marriage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron a merger also is more likely than a breakup Over the last few months I have pushed back my expectations of when Micron will begin a massive turnaround It is difficult to see that one has entered a value trap until well after the fact I now believe we are headed toward a rough few months ahead in the business but I also see this as being more than priced into the stock I have unloaded my call options in Micron over the last week but I have kept my much larger stock position intact which I doubled down on in the single digit and subteen range during February Bauposts Mooney stated In investing however there is no umpire calling balls and strikes and in retrospect we could have been even more patient at the plate What had for many investors been a growing pool of red ink during the year turned into a bloodbath by yearend To repurpose Warren Buffetts famous quote about managements and businesses when a talented investment team confronts an exceptionally challenging market sometimes the market wins at least in the short run In the case of Micron theres no doubt who has been winning right now I want to make the case that the game is far from over I firmly expect Micron longs to end up big winners at the end of this game I wrote this article myself and
