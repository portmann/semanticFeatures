expected to increase during to an annual average rate of over per year The quarterly movement in EPS will be dramatic out of top analysts have recently set <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price targets above as high as Historically as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>EPS rises its PE ratio also rises With an EPS of and corresponding PE ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock would reach per share by the end of A likely bump in EPS caused by the sales of Skylake with Windows would increase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to north of by December possibly much higher With Intels NASDAQ INTC recent earnings report and the Shenzhen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Developer Forum the nearterm future for INTC is becoming clearer A painfully slow first part of will blossom into full bloom going into the backtoschool and Christmas shopping seasons First I will highlight the movement I see coming in each segment of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>during Then I will review Intels movement in a more quantitative fashion The article will conclude with a review of likely perception swing All three of these analyses point to a great year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Growth in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>data center sales and more importantly growth in the companys profits in this area will drive significant increases in INTCs profits In my recent article I noted that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Data Center group now provides of the companys profits The level of profit contributed by DCG over time will grow Think of DCG as being on the beginning of the steep upward rise in a bell curve The chart below shows growth in sales of the various platforms relative to each other scales adjusted to show relative growth The overall trends are important and this article will focus on the part of the curves between the two vertical dashed lines representing the balance of Note that as we move forward the data center curve gets steeper while some trends are flat or declining Over the next five years the data center sales rate becomes the steepest curve Cisco NASDAQ CSCO estimates that by there will be billion Internet of Things devices connected to the Internet Even at that point we would have only penetrated about of all objects that potentially could be connected to the Internet of Things While the IoT will provide significant revenue growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the IoT must be supported by growth in data center capacity more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales and profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>while dabbling in the highvisibility home automation area of IoT is firmly focused on the industrial automotive and retail aspects of IoT These IoT uses provide significant returns on investment by reducing business costs and increasing business revenues In my mind this group includes all devices that we personally use for computing including desktop laptop ultrathins ins tablets phablets and smartphones The chart above shows that desktop sales have peaked laptops including ultrathins are still growing tablets have slowed considerably and smartphones are still growing but will slow over the next five years Since Intels investment in mobile is misunderstood by many I provide here a summary of why the company continues to invest in mobile Moores law drives computing smaller and smaller makes computing more mobile The continuation of Moores law down to nm and then likely into more compact D and further integration will provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with huge advantages in mobile Previous management missed this point Current management is investing in the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>so it stays dominant in future digital revolutions which we cant even describe right now Selling more mobile device chips helps to spread the cost of IP development over more units More than half of the bplus annual loss in mobile is to develop broadlyused IP allocation of new node development communications integration etc Selling more mobile device chips helps to increase the dominance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture platforms and helps drive more sales in the data center group Note that eventually selling more mobile will be making more Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone chips A reduction of m in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>contra revenue for mobile device chips will provide a welcome boost to earnings in late A major factor in increasing PC sales in the last half of will be the introduction of Windows along with Skylake during the summer I think this combination will unlock significant pentup demand for PCs in both the consumer and business sectors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shows NAND sales in its other group making tracking and estimates difficult I prefer to think of NAND as part of the Data Center Group since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sells most of its NAND through solidstate drives to data centers for high profit margins With the upcoming cost disruptive D NAND profits in this area will continue to grow along with data center growth A common method of estimating future stock price is to estimate earnings per share EPS and then multiply EPS times a pricetoearnings ratio PE EPS estimates can be taken from Intels guidance analyst estimates and our own estimates First lets look at EPS estimates based on Intels guidance Based on Intels latest guidance it appears that EPS for will be in the to range depending on how the guidance is interpreted Analysts estimate a range of EPS from to Jefferies follow link for details Apparently some analysts have very little confidence in Intels guidance some much lower and some much higher The analyst average EPS estimate for is according to Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Below I use the simple average of the high and low since Jefferies estimate is not included in Yahoos average Now lets consider PE ratios Over the last five years the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>PE ratio has ranged between a low of about to a high of about a huge range The chart below shows the relationships over time between EPS PE and stock price Generally as EPS increases the PE also increases providing a compounding effect on stock prices The reverse applies when EPS trends down Last year as EPS trended higher the PE trended higher creating significant increases in stock prices Now that the EPS has dropped the PE has dropped and stock prices have dropped dramatically I relate the change in PE to the shine of the company Growing profits add shine to the company and the PE goes up Other factors can also change the shine such as global economic changes acquisitions technology announcements etc The table below summarizes this review The range of estimates to me is a matter of perspective Different people look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>from different angles just like people look at different sides of a statue and develop different descriptions of it My perspective includes looking at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>by evaluating the likely success of its strategic initiatives in data center IoT PCs mobile and NAND These are the core of Intels revenue and profits Tip Ranks provides an encouraging view of analysts estimates While the average price target for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is five of the top analysts have recent price targets of and above Balance of Increasing SalesProfits Across all Platforms All of the platforms listed above will see increased sales and profits during the last half of Listening to various presentations made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>including the November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Day IDF in Shenzhen and earnings conference calls in January and April it is clear that sales and profits will increase in the last half of Likely these increases in the last half of will be not just significant as guided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but dramatic Guidance and analysts indicate that EPS will increase according to the blue bars below To get to Jefferies and my estimate of in EPS for the increases in quarterly EPS indicated in the red are necessary This dramatic increase in EPS is certainly possible and requires strong execution by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT various cloud providers various OEMs and good global economic conditions A lot to ask for but possible and increasingly likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made it clear that sales and profits will increase during the last half of This is becoming more clear to the market as analysts start to recognize the potential As more presentations are made and more information becomes available to confirm the dramatic growth in EPS described in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price will climb <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>options will rise dramatically Imagine the interest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock if the EPS for the rd quarter is double the earnings for the first quarter Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Train
