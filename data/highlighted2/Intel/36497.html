drop in Windows licensing revenue Slowing down the mighty assault of Googles AndroidChrome OS will require Microsoft to eventually give away free Windows licenses on all forms of consumer devices Like other PC salesdependent firms Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is likely to deliver earnings and revenue numbers lower than Estimize folks predict Microsoft will report earnings after the bell and I believe the effect of the jagged little pill of free Windows OS licensing that Nadella swallowed last year could again deliver lower Windows licensing revenue IDCs report of continued drop in PC sales is partly why MSFT has a YTD performance Most investors are still worried about the big yearoveryear decline in Devices and Consumer Licensings revenue and gross margin numbers The chart above is enough explanation that Devices and Consumer Licensing might also be feeling the heat from weaker Windows OEM licensing Microsofts April gift of free Windows OS to tablets and smartphone OEMs certainly aggravates the persistent problem of weakening PC sales Unfortunately I believe the jagged little pill of free Windows licensing will only grow bigger beyond tablets and smartphones Microsoft is

for because the Chinese OEM is not using a licensed Windows operating system Fudzilla discussed this problem of Microsoft only giving free Windows OS to tablet manufacturers The discrimination against

it is a more useful productivity tool than tablets or smartphones Enterprise IT managers still stubbornly holding on to their Windows XP machines could be enticed by cheap Windows HDMI PC sticks The energy efficiency of HDMI PC sticks from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is great for budgetconscious business users A Windows HDMI stick is only possible if Microsoft gives away free Windows licenses The loss of licensing fees could be recovered through search and digital display advertising Schools individuals and corporations who cannot afford a Chromebook could find a Windows HDMI Stick as a costefficient upgrade solution to their current Windows XP or Windows desktop computers The reality now is that the PC market is no longer limited to just desktop and laptop configurations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is making good money over its mini PC business However Microsofts refusal to give free Windows licensing to OEMs that create mini computers has forced other manufacturers to use Linux or Android Mini PC vendors are making the tiny PC form factor the saving grace in the troubled waters of declining PC sales Microsoft can help nurture the PConastick idea because lowpower tiny computers could be the next growth driver for Wintel machines Investors should prepare themselves for more quarters of lower Windows licensing sales Microsoft will keep on swallowing the painful jagged little pill of free Windows licensing It is a necessary evil that Nadella cannot avoid in his war against Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android The shortterm pain is great because it could lead to longterm financial gain Nadella is transforming Microsoft in to a miniGoogle that has the willingness to lose sales from software licensing just to gain access to peoples web browsing and online shopping habits The mobile compute industry now is all about getting the most amount of users The willingness of people to let Google or Facebook NASDAQ FB track their web and mobile activities is why digital advertising is such a gold mine Giving away free software services and operating systems is an effective bait to lockin the billions of advertisinghungry people that are getting farmed with Googles hypertargeted advertising Microsoft thanks to its massive presence in desktop computing could also replicate the success of Googles fanatical focus on digital advertising We must never forget that Microsoft rakes in billions of dollars from annual patent fees it charges to Android device manufacturers Microsoft can weather the pain of both a price war against Android phones and the loss of revenue from consumer Windows licensing AMDs NASDAQ AMD CEO Dr Lisa Su hinted that Windows will get commercial launching by end of July The universal crossplatform beauty of Windows might encourage a lot of app developers to favor Windows over Android The more games and apps that populate the Windows mobile ecosystem the more Android users could flock to the familiar comfort zone of Windows Allowing users of Android phone users to also get free custom Windows ROMs to replace the Android OS of their devices is also a future tailwind for Microsofts new freemium strategy Stealing the advertising eyeballs of Android users is sweet revenge If Microsoft continues to sell Windows licenses instead of giving them away more PC and mobile device OEMs could defect to Android or Chrome OS The racetothebottom pricing strategy of mini PC and smartphone vendors means Windowsfriendly OEMs need a free operating system to keep their products competitive with sub Android phones tablets and HDMI PC Sticks In spite of the pain of reduced Windows licensing revenue I still rate MSFT as a Buy Compared to its technology and industry peers Microsoft delivers higher operating margins but lower PE PS and PB ratios Source Microsoft The Jagged Little Pill Of Free Windows Could Get Bigger But I Like It Disclosure The author is long
