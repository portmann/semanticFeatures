Seeking Alpha This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at a report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is planning to announce a major round of layoffs In addition to weak PC sales the Altera acquisition mobile lossreduction efforts and a manufacturing strategy change could be motivating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to pare headcount <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC laid off of its workforce in and it appears as if a fresh round of big job cuts is on the way The Oregonian based out of a state that houses nearly a fifth of Intels K employee workforce reports the chip giant is prepping a significant round of layoffs across business units this spring The newspaper adds the cuts will reduce employment in some parts of Intels business by doubledigit percentages translating to thousands of job cuts by years end No specific date is given on when theyll be announced Intels Q report due on Tuesday afternoon would be a logical time A look at Gartner and IDCs Q PC sales data helps explain at least part of Intels motivation Though tablet sales are also declining and smartphone growth has slowed considerably the law of large numbers PC shipments managed to drop by double digits or close to it on a YY basis in Q a rate of decline that outpaced even the substantial rates seen in Q And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still got of its revenue from its Client Computing Group in This clearly isnt just about mobile device spending taking dollars away from PC spending A lot of PC users simply feel as if their existing systems are good enough for the productivity and entertainment apps that they normally run Going forward there might be several technologiestrends that spark a rebound in PC upgrade rates Windows related enterprise upgrades K video and gaming convertiblesdetachable tablets virtual reality and interest in higherresolution notebook displays come to mind But for now its very much a waitandsee situation There are also some Intelspecific factors that could be driving major layoffs To start the company recently swallowed Altera and its employees and there are doubtlessly opportunities to remove duplicate functions particularly in GA spending And it has been intent on paring and eventually eliminating losses within its mobile chip operations which produced a B operating loss in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>no longer breaks out the performance of its mobile chip ops by itself but the company has indicated its losses narrowed considerably in Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>just signaled its historical ticktock manufacturing cycle two CPU platforms per manufacturing process will be giving way to a ticktocktock three platforms per process cycle and has already committed to launching a third platform Kaby Lake for its nm process This shift stands to lower the longterm pace of Intels manufacturingrelated capex and RD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is five months removed from hiring Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM vet Murthy Renduchintala to run a massive new productRD group covering many business units and just a couple weeks removed from announcing the pending departures of the heads of two of those overseen units the Client Computing Group and Internet of Things Group Also wireless modemradio engineering chief Aicha Evans is reportedly resigning This was followed by news <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is overhauling its financial reporting The company will begin breaking out the performance of its flash memory and security softwareservice ops and will also break out the Altera units numbers This increased transparency could motivate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to pay more attention to the profitability of the aforementioned businesses And just a couple days ago The Oregonian published parts of a leaked memo from Renduchintala to other senior management members in which he didnt mince words about perceived shortcomings in Intels RD approach Over the last three months I have conducted numerous project reviews with our execution teams and there is a clear trend that has emerged in these reviews a lack of productcustomer focus in execution that is creating schedule and competitiveness gaps in our products He proposed dealing with the issue by creating temporary threeperson leadership teams from across business functions for six products The products are said to be Kaby Lake Intels first and second nm CPU platforms respectively Cannonlake and Ice Lake a nextgen G baseband modem the and two platforms that havent yet been publicly discussed Coffee Lake possibly a thirdgen nm platform and Glenview possibly an Atom CPU platform given past Atom platforms have had view suffixes Renduchintala called for managements active participation and support in implementing the threeleader product development model throughout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I will need your help in quickly identifying the best internal people to fill these important roles and where appropriate place the right external hires in these roles to drive success Its possible such a big shakeup also involves letting go of employees that arent deemed to be a good fit for the new approach If the layoffs are announced with the Q report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will probably share details on the earnings call about what its exactly looking to accomplish Its clear however that there are plenty of recent events that could drive the company to lower headcount Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in
