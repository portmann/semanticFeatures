retirement Im amazed that there are times when I am given a little gift with seemingly bad news While on the surface the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>news might appear wonderful for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as far as I am concerned it is a blessing in disguise for Qualcomm I have been following the recent developments surrounding the Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM announcements that it will be dramatically enhancing shareholder value in the form of consistent and meaningful dividend increases as well as a larger shareholder buyback plan Effective immediately the Board has authorized the Company to repurchase up to billion of its common stock The billion program replaces the previous program which had a billion authorization remaining The Board also approved a percent increase in Qualcomms quarterly cash dividend raising the annualized dividend payout to per share of common stock As a dividend growth investor this is music to my ears and to anyone who has been watching this story unfold who is inclined to purchase QCOM now might be the best time to begin building a position thanks to another chip maker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC But Wait <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Will Be Supplying A Apple iPhone With Chips That Has Always Been A Revenue Source For QCOM According to this report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be a supplier to Apple NASDAQ AAPL in for a new smartphone While neither Apple nor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are commenting the report offers this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will provide the fast wireless modem chip for a new Apple smartphone in VentureBeat has learned from two sources with knowledge of the companies plansIntels new LTE modem will occupy a socket on the new iPhones circuit board thats long been reserved for Qualcomm chipsFor months Apple engineers have been making trips to Munich Germany to work with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>engineers to ready the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>LTE chip for the iPhone one of our sources saidQualcomm has long been the leader in providing chips for phones and has provided the modems for generations of iPhones But our sources say Apple and Qualcomm have an uneasy relationship If I were an INTC shareholder I would be jumping for joy and if I owned QCOM I would be more than ticked off The markets took this news that way and sent the shares of QCOM tumbling to roughly share the other day which is around off of its week high of nearly share while INTC soared by about at the time of the news Some weak forward guidance from QCOM has also turned the stock into an underperformer since the last earnings conference call In the face of a decent quarter that announcement has put pressure on the share price since then and aside from the bounce up to about on the day it announced its greatly enhanced shareholder value efforts The Bottom Line Is Once Again All About Income As of today the share price of QCOM is sitting at about which is not far from its week lows of about share While I believe there could be further price erosion as the INTC story unfolds or gains more clarity and credibility I also believe that dividend growth investors can take advantage of the slump in the QCOM share price to at the very least ease into a stock that has formally and publicly announced its intent to reward shareholders with stronger dividend increases and massive share buybacks Since QCOM has paid and increased dividends every year and is now in year of that effort I believe the company will be a dividend aristocrat as it implied Our business continues to generate substantial operating cash flow and todays announcement represents an important step in returning that cash to our owners while still preserving the strategic flexibility needed to drive stockholder value through growth said Steve Mollenkopf CEO of Qualcomm Incorporated I am pleased that we continue to build on our track record of returning capital to stockholders having exceeded each of our capital return commitments in and returned approximately billion to stockholders since these programs began in In the last years QCOM has increased its dividend from about share annually to the latest number of share While the current yield is only the rate of increases over an extended period of time has been exceptional Unless my math is wrong it looks like about an average of a annual increase over the past decade including the latest hike As a dividend growth investor for retirement I myself view this company as a potential core holding for any incomeseeking investor who wants their income to grow consistently into the future for a more secure retirement andor financial future The Basic Fundamentals Appear To Display A Decent Buy Right Now As most of you know I use a very simple measurement to evaluate a stock as a potential buy If the share price is between the week high and low it gives me more reason to investigate Since I myself am not trying to time the market and quality companies will always trend higher especially dividend aristocrats I do not get carried away with charts and graphs to try to pinpoint my purchases The share price today is leaning towards the lower range of that week midpoint share price and by beginning a position in QCOM at current levels not only can you increase income immediately but when the share price rebounds an increase in total returns could be achieved as well To take advantage of the recent downward trend of QCOM share pricing I would break up my purchases into quartersized buys So if your goal is to own shares why not consider buying shares at a time spaced evenly over the course of the next weeks as more of any INTC news may affect the QCOM share price Some other valuation basics for your review from Yahoo Finance The dividend payout ratio is just which lends itself to solid increases in the years ahead of all outstanding shares are held by institutions If the rumors are true about INTC replacing QCOM with some Apple smartphone chips then why would the company come out with this announcement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>INTC now expects Q revenue of BB below prior guidance of BB and a B consensus Gross margin guidance remains at with lower volumes offset by higher ASPs All other expectations have been withdrawn that presumably includes fullyear guidance for midsingle digit revenue growth Guidance will be updated during Intels April Q report If the great news about INTC being used by Apple to replace some QCOM chips were accurate wouldnt the market be forward looking beyond this bit of news INTC shares are down today QCOM shares are down today as well but which dividend stock would YOU favor more right now Disclaimer The opinions of the author are not recommendations to either buy or sell any security Please remember to do your own
