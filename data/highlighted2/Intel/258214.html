The SC Super Computing conference highlighted the revolutionary impact HPC High Performance Computing is having on our lives HPC takes science from experimentation and interpretive analysis and allows predictive simulation and modeling to solve previously unsolvable complex problems in areas such as weather medicine manufacturing and space HPC also is revolutionizing itself by using predictive simulations and modeling to make faster more efficient and more useful HPC processors communications systems and applications The democratization of HPC use in the Cloud is an <span

NASDAQ INTC General Manager of the Data Center Group Diane Bryant and six key <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>staff working on HPC highperformance computing talked about how HPC Everywhere is revolutionizing science The SC video is a must see for anyone interested in how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>DCG will exceed CAGR for at least the next four years Often dismissed as small dollar sales and not moving the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>revenue needle HPC is now going mainstream and becoming accessible beyond huge corporations academia and government The Maker movement is a strong impetus to broader use of HPC in the Cloud Makers understand the value and importance of HPC and are eager to have access to the predictive simulation and modeling that was previously simply not possible HPC is being democratized and is becoming available through the cloud to medium and small businesses health organizations and Makers One example was the use of HPC to model air flow around a semitruck resulting in design improvements that will save millions of dollars of fuel Another example is using HPC to perform predictive simulation complex gnome pattern recognition and modeling to find cures for Parkinsons and other diseases As it becomes more and more available HPC will allow predictive simulation pattern recognition and modeling uses that we cannot even conceive of doing at this point Even today HPC is being used to design Intels nm processor performing complex predictive simulation and modeling at the atomic level as needed to achieve the nm node Machine learning will further accelerate the democratization of HPC by allowing development of more advanced chips communications and applications and by revolutionizing the way complex problems are solved SSF is touted as critical to the success of democratizing HPC Intels system approach is to use an OmniPath Architecture including a new HPCoptimized fabric technology that makes the performance of HPC clusters more accessible to a broader variety of users OPA is an endtoend fabric solution that costeffectively improves the performance of HPC applications for entry level to largescale HPC clusters The system includes fabric see animation of how it works to tie memory and storage more closely to the processor to achieve dramatically better performance Intels OPA includes the fabric connecting memorystorage to the CPU ports switches and interface adapters an endtoend solution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel

processor will see ubiquitous use throughout the cloud and by anybody wanting to make use of Big Data analytics predictive simulation and complex modeling The Xeon Phi coprocessor currently sells for
