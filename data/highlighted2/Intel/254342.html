More Reasons Why AMD Will Be In Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha Graphics market share coming back incrementally million in cash coming soon from Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics deal I have previously written about reasons to buy Advance Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD for a multibagger gain in Reasons Why AMD Will Be By and AMD This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AnkleBiter Is On Its Way To Substantial Profits My basic argument is AMD is priced for failure even bankruptcy and this gives investors an opportunity to make a lot of money in the next two years or so The longer AMD survives the more likely the huge gain in price is coming In October AMD announced an agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics for the sale of of its SATS facilities for net cash of about million This gives AMD enough money to complete all the important product developments especially the new Zen processor See AMD Cash Infusion Means It Is Time To Buy This Beleaguered Laggard for more on the subject Sony NYSE SNE just announced that sales of PlayStation have exceeded million units Although Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has not announced unit sales of Xbox One it is certainly on an upward trajectory too Increased game console sales adds more viability to AMDs future growth And it looks like AMD will be adding Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY to its game console stable For the first time in at least a decade AMD will be on the same production node as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC CEO Lisa Su has announced that two products have been taped out for NM production in This means for example that AMD will be making a big leap in technology from the NM Carrizo chip to the Zens NM FinFET and will immediately be much more competitive in the CPU and GPU market This should result in market share gains beginning in Per CEO Lisa Su on AMDs Q earnings conference call more custom SoC contracts have been signed and will start generating revenue in This is in addition to the game consoles SoC Yes so the way I would think about the enterprise embedded and semicustom segment in terms of longerterm revenue growth in as we said we will have additional semicustom revenue ramping in the second half of so I think that would be one driver Rumors have it Apple NASDAQ AAPL is looking to AMD for a custom x SoC for Obviously you must take all rumors with a huge grain of salt but if this one comes true AMDs stock price will zoom Why would Apple switch from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to AMD How about custom design to Apples specs CPU and GPU similar to the iPhone lower cost compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and a future choice of x or ARM Of course the whole thing including the rumor could just be a negotiating ploy by Apple to get a better price from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Time will tell For the last few quarters AMD has been losing GPU market share to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and NVIDIA NASDAQ NVDA However it looks like market share has increased marginally in Q and on increasing GPU sales too AMD shipments increased by quarter to quarter This is certainly a big step up from ever decreasing unit sales seen in the previous quarters And the latest AMD addinboard AIB the R Nano has received rave reviews The steady lowering of SGA expenses over the last five quarters is a big plus for future profits And the sale of the SATS facilities will lower it even more in In addition CAPEX should decrease also after the sale closes Since the taping has begun on Zen see above you can reasonably expect the Zen desktop chipset to at least be available for testing in To me this is the single biggest event in the last years for AMD With the Zen capabilities certainly matching at least the low and medium range of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips and possibly the highest Zen should allow AMD to capture the biggest market share of desktops and later servers since the Athlon was released in As a personal observation I looked through all the Christmas ads for PCs and laptops over Thanksgiving and of the ads I saw were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and only one was AMD That says it all about the current state of affairs and I am confident the Zen chip will change that come CEO Dr Lisa Su has impressed me with her leadership and determination To be honest I was not completely enamored when Su took over the helm of AMD I am not a big fan of engineers as CEOs because in my experience business leadership skills are very different from technical skills and they are seldom found in the same person I think perhaps Dr Su is one of the exceptions She has been relentlessly focused on developing products that can be sold and delivered now as opposed to years from now She has cut costs and raised needed cash from the sale of the SATS facilities And her calm and professional demeanor adds an air of confidence to her presentations I will reserve final judgment until Who would buy or make a large investment in AMD Well anyone looking for semicustom SoC capabilities with high IP content such as the game consoles or Zen and GPUs Add in membership in the x duopoly along with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>of course and this is a very interesting company on the cusp of a big breakout in revenue and profits How about Tsinghau Group the Chinese company that recently invested billion in Western Digital NASDAQ WDC and enabled WDC to take over SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK Tsinghau also made a billion bid for Micron NASDAQ MU and recently announced it would build a billion fab in China to enhance Chinas position in the integrated circuits market In total Tsinghau has billion to spend and making x and semicustom chips in China may have a lot of appeal Interestingly Tsinghau has a billion joint venture with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>related to Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics And no cross licensing of x IP would not be a problem as explained here by AMD I have often been asked why I like AMD so much more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The reasons are many but the biggest one is the huge upside of AMD over the next two years I think barring a buyout AMD has an excellent chance to be a fourbagger by the end of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand has a driver in D XPoint but other than that it will at best be a mediocre investment over the next two years And I am not sure exactly what profits will be generated over that time period unless DX ramps up to highprofit volume a lot faster than it looks like it will With Intels management projecting a pedestrian midsingle digits revenue increase in the same as their projections it is difficult to see a huge price increase anytime in the next two years In all other areas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has companies such as Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM ARM ARM Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX and yes AMD gunning for its high margin products In any event I dont see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can be even a double by while AMD most certainly will be and more if it just delivers what is in its house right now Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the much safer bet with its generous dividend huge cash flows and its semimonopolies in desktop and server chips But for my money I will ride with AMD
