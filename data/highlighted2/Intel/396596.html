style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced that its discontinuing its Atom tablet and smartphone processors This is not mere tactical retreat but a true capitulation in the mobile space Intels NASDAQ INTC announcement that it is discontinuing Atom processors for smartphones and tablets appears to have taken many by surprise This decision was inevitable but its only the first step and the easier one The much more difficult decision will be about where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>goes from here Those who have been following my coverage on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will know that Ive been warning about Intels retreat from the mobile space ever since its Investor Meeting back in November By the time of Intels Q earnings report in January what had been merely retreat had become a full fledged mobile device capitulation in my view At the time I wrote Theoretically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still plans to move SoFIA now fabricated by TSMC on a nm process to its own nm process this year I frankly doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will bother There is no market for it By the time that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reported its Q earnings it was becoming clear that major changes were approaching An outsider and former executive with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Murthy Renduchintala had been brought in to oversee Client Computing and IoT Kirk Skaugen head of the Client Computing Group and Doug Davis head of IoT Group were made his direct reports Shortly after it was announced that Skaugen and Davis were leaving the company When you peel back the PR spin it becomes fairly obvious that these longtime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>executives were no longer happy What wasnt clear was what exactly they were unhappy about But there were indications At the Q conference call Krzanich stated that Murthy was in charge of a comprehensive review of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products There can be little doubt that the decision regarding the Atom X series X SoFIA X and X as well as the decision to pull the plug on the next generation Broxton Atoms was an output of Murthys review There have been a number of articles written concerning the decision such as Patrick Moorheads piece in Forbes and contributor Bruce Burnworths article here on SA What seems to be missing from these articles is any substantial consideration of why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made the decisions they did Even now there seems to be a reluctance especially by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls to acknowledge that the products failed In light of the decision that can be taken as a given The more important question is why they failed which no one seems to want to talk about Intels statements which have been made in various forms since the Investor Meeting that it is shifting priorities dont really constitute an answer to the question They are merely descriptions of Intels response to the situation The answer to this question is really critical to evaluating Intels response and ultimately Intels value as an investment But it isnt really a difficult question to answer assuming one can achieve a modicum of emotional detachment Fundamentally the products were uncompetitive in the marketplace Why werent they competitive For a long time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls have extolled the virtues of Intels technical prowess They have asserted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors were the equal of any processor based on the ARM architecture licensed by ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH This is perhaps arguable but lets accept it as true If we accept that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mobile processors were not technically disadvantaged then there is only one way in which they could fail to be market competitive and thats based on cost And this has been my fundamental premise for quite a while going back to when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>first instituted its contra revenue subsidies on tablet processors starting in The fact that contra revenue was even necessary was a huge clue as was the subsequent huge loss of the Mobile and Communications Group of billion in At the time there were any number of rationalizations for the losses being offered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls I opted for the simplest explanation that Intels x architecture simply wasnt cost competitive with ARM And I dared to suggest that Intels strategy was a waste of time and that it needed to come up to speed in designing ARM architecture processors Id like to take the opportunity to offer some observations about methodology Im sure its clear to traditional journalists that I often violate journalistic convention As a blogger I have a little more freedom in that regard which I enthusiastically exploit Journalists are generally constrained to report facts which they have been able to verify with direct sources In financial reporting theres a dearth of high quality facts Intels decision regarding its mobile devices has probably been known within the company for some time but only recently could be reported as fact Such high quality facts are a comparative rarity On the other hand the Internet provides an abundance of lowquality data Rumors speculation aberrant analyses spin doctoring by spokespersons In this context of often conflicting information almost any point of view can be supported with relevant facts Doubtless there will be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls who will assert that the accuracy of my prognostications is mere luck and the product of my hostile attitude toward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Invariably when people disagree with my viewpoint some negative emotional bias on my part is asserted But I dont just write articles to grind an ax or promote a particular stock This is getting the process backwards What I do is sift through the huge pile of data both high and low quality to arrive at a picture of whats really going on in a particular company That mental picture that I form is often at odds with conventional wisdom prevailing views in the media as well as the PR mouthpieces of the companies involved The accuracy of the assessments about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that I made a couple of years ago was not the product of luck While the analysis and conclusions that I offer may often be in contravention to traditional journalism the accuracy of those conclusions has often been born out by subsequent events <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a case in point The implications of the lack of cost competitiveness with ARM extend far beyond the mobile space If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>couldnt be competitive in mobile against ARM processors why does it think it will have any better luck against ARM processors in the data center or the Internet of Things Theres an obvious answer there one the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls arent going to like Intels decision to pull the plug on its Atom mobile processors is just the easy first step of the process As I pointed out in Intels Choice Retrenchment Or Transformation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has to make a very fundamental decision about processor architecture continue x or pursue ARM The discontinuance of the Atoms is common to either branch in this decision nexus Which branch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will opt for is critical If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chooses retrenchment with x in its datacenter and IoT businesses then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doomed to a slow painful death If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chooses ARM it still has an uphill battle ahead of it The baton of technical leadership has already passed to the companies that design their own unique ARM architecture processors Apple NASDAQ AAPL Qualcomm and Samsung OTCSSNLF <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will have to work hard to catch up to them I dont regard retrenchment as a foregone conclusion especially since an exQualcomm man with experience in the ARM world appears to be in charge of this decision process Until we hear more about this decision I regard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a hold Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other
