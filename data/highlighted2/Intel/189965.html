class='textDiv'>Apple Will Take A Long Time To Make A Full Switch To ARM Or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha A recent article on Seeking Alpha asserted that Apple is going to make a complete switch toward ARM architecture There is this conviction because ARM CPUs get similar or better performance per watt against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs in certain synthetic benchmarks This approach is wrong because performance per watt is completely different with higher TDPs Comparing different architectures on different OSs and platform through synthetic benchamrks is completely wrong The only way is to make comparisons is by real use applications ARM architecture will take a lot of time to be really competitive in the desktopworkstationserver segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will not remain lazy regarding this Recently I read an article about Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL and its road to substitute <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC CPUs with the Apple ARM ARM Holdings plc NASDAQ ARMH selfdesigned architecture The entire thesis and plan would make sense because self designing both mobile and desktop CPUs would greatly reduce costs and certainly increase profits However there is a single big flaw in the entire reasoning a flaw that brings down the entire piece The Apple A SoC is put at the same level of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>desktop CPUs The author probably considers truthful what Apple declared at the last keynote Apple A is a desktop class SoC Apple is talking about CPUs and SoCs with similar computational capacities a very aggressive advertisement This is supported by the fact that Apple considers its new SoCs faster than of existing laptops This is incredible And this is the main reason why people think Apple could decide to design its own desktop CPUs However how do they compare those SoCs and CPUs Such a comparison is generally made with synthetic benchmarks and the author does not disprove this since it recalls Geekbench too Apple A scores in singlecore and in multicore while the Core m y scores in singlecore and in multicore preseries model If we consider that Core M has a TDP of W while Apple A must have a TDP around W a TDP below W would not meet Anandtech power analysis on iPhone and Apple tablets it looks like performance per watt is somewhat equal or in Apples favor So why do I not agree Geekbench is not reliable at all like any other bunch of synthetic benchmarks moreover if you compare different architectures under different systems and OSs For those who have read PC reviews for years its clear that only real world benchmarks have some kind of reliable index If you make tons of tests with tons of real use applications then you will have a good evaluation of what that CPU is capable of On the contrary synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench are not reliable when used between different architectures and OSs There are variables like compilers instruction sets specific optimizations microcodes and specific operations that can completely change the final result Take Apple A nm and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core M Y nm in D Mark Unlimited as an example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoC is faster by in physics and in graphics Therefore the problem is that these results do not mean anything reliable since they are too dependent on the program itself We would need some real world application tests or several benchmarks that replicate real world program computation at least Saying that A is equal to Core M its simply a marketing move without a real basis and Apple knows it For example consider the AMD Athlon X W and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Pentium XE W The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU was faster by in Sisoft Sandra a synthetic benchmark but when tested in various real programs the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU was generally quite behind This comparison is made between different architectures but still X and the same OS nevertheless results from synthetic benchmarks and real use were completely different So if what I am saying is right how can we better compare different architectures The best way would be having the same OS and running the same applications after that we could evaluate the SoCs and CPUs by testing a lot This way is not practicable until it will be possible to run some tests on Windows with continuum the new Lumia could give us some great insight Nowadays the only way is to use Linux based benchmarks like SPEC CPU which replicates quite well the server and workstation load For example we could look at the comparison between Apple A nm and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon LV nm in the following table Notice that we are talking about the SPECint_ which is practically a single thread and not a multicore benchmark This implies that theres no hint about the multithread capacity and considering the TDP is quite difficult and misleading As you can see the performances are quite similar However Apple A is obviously more efficient since it has a TDP around W while the Xeon is at W the Xeon effective TDP is practically lower since the W TDP was reached only by Xeon LV But if we get more insight we must look at things from a different point of view Comparing CPUs W against CPUs W or more is simply wrong the relation between power consumption and performances is roughly exponential due to leakage current problems The lower is the requested speed the lower will be the requested voltage and the generated power But the lower is the generated power the lower will be the leakage current and consequently lower voltage will be sufficient In the above image the matter is more clear once you cut the frequency from GHz to GHz the iK improves its performance per watt by In our case the leap from WW to W of power consumption would imply a better performance per watt by This kind of comparison is specific to those CPUs but the reasoning can be applied to every kind of CPU from a qualitative point of view This behavior is supported by the following image that shows how leakage current grows dramatically with the required performances This specific behavior tells us that considering the SoC efficiency at W is totally different from doing it at W or W A synthetic intensive benchmark immediately pushes a low power SoC to its TDP limits Its different for desktop CPUs CPUs reach their thermal limits after some time which means that the initial required power is quite below the specific TDP In addition only the top CPU of each TDP series reached the declared TDP The Apple A architecture was designed in while the Xeon LV was designed in Such a difference is biblical in informatics terms We find that Apple A has a nm node technology while the Xeon was made with nm node technology The node technology reduction can be exploited better only at very low TDPs when a CPU must work at tens of watts the benefits from miniaturization get massively restrained due to leakage currents If we consider a very low power consumption segment below one watt the leap from nm to nm would have brought a better performance per watt around Such behavior becomes more clear if we look at the following table Notice that Haswell architecture was not heavily focused on working at such low TDPs You can see that its possible to achieve better efficiency at low TDPs At the same time both architectural evolutions and technology node innovations give enormous results at low TDPs and they are constrained at higher TDPs Just from here its very hard to compare such different architectures from different periods technologies and so on The comparison between different CPU targets is completely wrong without any doubt It also is completely wrong to think that a W TDP ARM SoC which works well in Geekbench could be the same at much higher TDP values in real usage Now I want to show you what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has managed to do with the server CPUs in the W TDP range picking up similar CPUs from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon LV nm and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon EL v nm Notice that I had to use SPEC CPU and not the version The version is not used in the desktop and server environment anymore These tables simply support the previous part the miniaturization and architectural evolutions are remarkable but still constrained by the high TDP Well till this point I have explained why its hard to compare different architectures and CPUs with different technology nodes But mostly I have explained why comparing different CPUs with different TDPs is completely wrong Finally I want to show you why ARM architecture has a long way to go before achieving similar performances to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs Anandtech has showed that the actual server ARM SoCs from Applied Micro are still quite bad This is caused by the nm technology node that they used for the XGene which is a customization of the ARM AA cores The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offer instead was at nm As you can see the XGene performs a very low performance per watt The company declared that the XGene which will have some architectural optimization will come with of efficiency thanks to the nm node Moreover if that architecture was made with a nm node it would probably still achieve lower results compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but it would not be so far from the Atom solution The problem is that the Avaton Atom was derived from architectural improvements of the development line a quite old architecture compared to the ARMva which has been designed in the years Remember that Intels focus on low consumption is a relatively fresh focus It also is true that XGene will be a nm FF SoC powered by customized A cores but at the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is using Broadwell to substitute the server Atom offer The preproduction Xeon D series will provide better performance per watt by compared to Avaton Atom In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to release the Skylake server offer in Q which will bring additional efficiency There also are other competitors like Cavium ThunderX If we take a look at some preseries internal tests it looks like the cores version W obtains point at SPECint_rate while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon EL v single CPU W obtains points This implies roughly of performance per watt in Intels favor In addition the ThunderX is an updated architecture while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>one is an old project As for the node technology Cavium still uses a nm against Intels nm which historically brings of additional efficiency at those TDPs Various ARM producers are still behind in technology node architecture performances and power consumption while others are quite closer to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Cavium is an example Clearly we could see an ARM CPU close the gap in coming years if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does not accelerate on development In the meantime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is increasing its server velocity upgrade since its going to show two new server architectures in Q Broadwell Q Skylake Just from this I would say that ARM will still take a lot of time to close the gap before it begins to be really compelling the development for server and workstation programs takes time And its not granted that ARM will manage to always improve like its doing nowadays At the same time it would be strange seeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>not accelerating on development given its declared laziness in the last few years You also must consider what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has managed to do when it released the Haswell v series like EL v compared to the desktop counterpart cores it managed to improve performance per watt by exploiting lower frequencies and a higher core number This kind of approach is similar to what ARM producers are doing If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>decides to heavily exploit this way expect great results But despite this I think this is not enough to really believe that the ARM switch is long to happen In fact there are other considerations to be done First of all Apple has higher sales thanks to full Windows compatibility In fact once Apple announced the switch over from Power PC Mac sales increased a lot in comparison to Windows PC sales A total switch to ARM would cutoff a substantial part of those who need Windows since the Microsoft Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ MSFT OS is still extremely important in the IT environment Secondly Apple switched from the PowerPC architecture when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>got higher performances around an enormous gap In addition the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inability to provide a sufficient and good mobile offer is not equal to the PowerPC inability of those years moreover when workstations PCs and professional laptops serve customers with completely different needs From this point of view it may also be possible that Apple is waiting for Intels next mobile offer in the coming two to three years given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is increasing a lot the mobile development and is already testing Core M on big smartphones At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is accelerating on allinone SoC series to be released in An Applelike behavior would be waiting and studying any possible future innovation from its partners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>included when things are not clear And things are not clear now Third Apple makes deep considerations before doing ecosystem transitions A complete switch is problematic in terms of convenience timing and capability It would have to spend a lot in research and building to assure the right support for multicore drivers APIs PCIe IO and a lot of other features in order to scale them from iPhone to Mac Pro Furthermore Apple waited for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to have the upperhand in the PC field to make the switch so its likely to wait and see what ARM producers are able to do at desktopserver TDP segments Designing ARM SoCs for the mobile segment is a completely different matter than designing ARM SoCs for the desktop segment Apple has no real experience in that field and ARM producers are starting to show something interesting only in the server field To conclude Tim Cook has just declared that Apple has no intention to merge iOS and OSx He wants them to be two separated and distinct operative systems He also said that having different operating systems provide the best experience for those different needs This kind of declaration sounds like a stop to ARM switchover because it would cut off the compatibility and interoperability that characterizes the Mac offer It does not mean that a full architectural switch is completely impossible in their plans but it means that its more difficult to happen any time soon In this scenario Apple will have to wait a lot of time before it will be possible to raise profits by selfdesigning desktop CPUs Surely such a plan would crush costs and theoretically massively raise profits from Mac sales but given Apples behavior in such policies and given the Windows compatibility influence Apple will wait a long time before making a total switch In addition Mac sales are around million units per year therefore the self designing would bring cost reduction for no more than billion less than of profit growth not accounting for lower sales due to the compatibility absence for X applicationsOSs Moreover Apple will likely look at what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be able to offer in the next few years we know that ARM architecture is going very well but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is becoming more and more interesting in the mobile sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is planning to release allinone SoCs in the coming two years while its going to close the gap in the Atom development line remember that the latest Atom architecture comes from Broadwell and not Skylake therefore expect consistent better performance next year thanks to Kaby Lake derived architecture In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has the chance to raise the core number and to lower frequencies to obtain great performance per watt and its already looking at that I would not be surprised to see Apple considering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>instead for a total switch someday in the future Nowadays do not expect any deep change for Apple Its revenues and profits will remain highly dependent on the iPhone business for some time Keep an eye on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>instead because it may start to be compelling in the mobile business in the next coming years We only use your contact details to reply to your
