<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Needs Fabs To Sustain Its Durable Competitive Advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels fab is instrumental in sustaining the companys gross margins Theres likely to be cost dissynergies if in the event a spinoff were to occur Furthermore Intels inhouse fab was instrumental in the development of D NAND which creates RD synergies for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a whole Theres no need to separate the company into two different operating entities when based on the peer performance group and the longrun inefficiencies Also the timing would negate the effectiveness for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders and theres no guarantee that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can win chip designs even if the fab were to operate independently Im writing this article in response to Technology Investings recent stance on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC fabs He makes a couple good points when it comes down to the marginal improvement in performance but strategically speaking less focus on fabs is a very shortsighted move and I dont think it will add much shareholder value Fabrication technology is much less important than it was in the past Having to keep fabs busy and to finance the RD for newer processes sometimes forces <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to make aggressive moves that hurt stockholder value Competition has closed the gap with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and appears to be poised to overtake the company For starters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>supports a broad lineup of products with its fabs which means that the additional volume from quark to highperformance CPUs all contributes to the profitability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fabs The cost of building a fab is fixed and the marginal cost per unit is driven by the wafer cost Generally speaking the cost of revenue is inclusive of depreciation and amortization expense and the cost of additional wafers Having more wafers run through the process improves the profitability which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>economics is driven by scale The incremental scale reduces the marginal cost of production which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the most profitable company in its space and that trend will continue with the introduction of other products Sure the mobile segment hasnt generated much in terms of growth and its even losing money for the time being But then again no one said Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM lead in mobile design was minuscule Qualcomm continues to design well performing chips and its likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is perhaps a couple years away from designing highend chips that can compete with Qualcomm However if you were to include the additional volume into the calculation of Intels longterm gross margins theres additional mobile upside so as long as theyre more efficient with OpEx pertaining to mobile and gain mobile wins in the mid to lowtier of the market Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had the process technologies in place they were able to design a separate manufacturing facility in joint partnership with Micron for cuttingedge flash storage and nextgeneration memory which they brand as D XPoint So there are obvious RD synergies that come from having both chip design and manufacturing in one place Not only does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have the ability to create custom solutions but they also have the ability to quickly implement new designs into final products which shortens the release window When looking at the profitability metrics of other semiconductor names <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is much more profitable on a gross margin basis Qualcomms gross margins are driven by the licensing business which is almost pure profit and even then Qualcomm doesnt have higher margins than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA on the other hand doesnt own its own fab and its graphics business also is very profitable but its less profitable than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Even Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM is less profitable and they focus specifically on just being a fab When you combine both fab and chip design under one roof the company tends to be more profitable so as long as the fab utilization is sufficient In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>it would be prudent to anticipate a couple more points in terms of margins once they are able to move FPGAs onto their own process and sell more microcontroller units as a part of their big data initiative Also its worth considering that TSM is very profitable That markup they are able to generate from wafers is included in Qualcomms COGs So even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were to split apart its business the profitability wouldnt improve but rather it would decline as the cost of designing a new fab would require <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to charge some sort of markup on wafer supply agreements to other semiconductor names Furthermore if Intels delay to nm proves to be accurate it would be precisely the wrong time to orchestrate a spinoff as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders would be split apart at a time where Intels fab probably wouldnt secure any orders for highend chips In other words a spinoff would result in a loselose situation for the separate classes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders who would own a piece of two companies that have lost their operating leverage due to dissynergies Therefore investors should patiently wait for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to reveal its longterm roadmap at its analyst day conference in Q At that event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely demonstrate a value creation roadmap that will be more inclusive of alternative products which will fillup whatever remaining capacity is available The increase in CAPEX isnt only attributed to the increasing cost of developing cutting edge nodes but also is attributed to an increase in capacity That incremental capacity leads to more volume which correspondingly leads to higher gross margins While the stock is performing poorly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is performing well when compared to peers and its competitive moat is well established While competing fabs may have a better roadmap theres no guarantee that they can deliver nm technologies in Q Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt plan on adopting extreme ultraviolet lithography which will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a cost advantage even when running at a more advanced node when compared to peers in its space Sure theyre not going to gain the business of Qualcomm and Nvidia but in all reality they really dont need to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>probably wont secure any wins even if they were to split apart so theres no point in pursuing a riskier strategy for the sake of pure fablike margins TSM already revealed that they dont have that much pricing leverage and Qualcomm doesnt have that much pricing flexibility as its EPS and margins eroded the moment they lost highend chip orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>unlike Qualcomm can compete in the lowend without sacrificing as much margin In short summary
