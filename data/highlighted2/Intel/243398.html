class='textDiv'>Intels nm Transition And The Impact On Gross Margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>elaborated on their process advantage throughout the course of their investor day presentation Given what was presented its fair to anticipate an improvement to yields and falling costs per transistor This translates into higher successive gross margins through an investment and growth phase I anticipate that if FCFgross margin trends continue the nm family should drive gross margins in excess of At this years investor day conference <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC went into excruciating detail with regards to their process improvements More specifically Bill Holt laid out much of the granular data as investors have been wondering where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stands in terms of cost per transistor improvements and the incremental RD needed to sustain generational node improvements For the most part I came away impressed with the level of progress despite the lagging improvements to yield trends when compared to the nm Haswell generation The company mentions that by the first half of the yields per wafer should be roughly equivalent to its nm counterpart Furthermore these yield improvements should translate into higher gross margins given the falling cost of transistors As such Intels manufacturing process seems better from both a costperformance standpoint when compared to TSM NYSE TSM and Samsung OTCSSNLF Also there seems to be rampant speculation over Chinese competition however Chinese fabs with the exception of TSM are operating on much older process technology Technically TSM is based out of Taiwan and isnt keen on the idea of moving production into the Chinese mainland due to regulatory risks Furthermore Taiwan isnt a territory governed by the Republic of China but of course both sides take on an opposing stance when pertaining to territorial disputes Nonetheless when I refer to Chinese semiconductors this discussion on Chinese semiconductors is not inclusive of TSM While China is a competitive headwind the degree to which it will impact Intels core business seems limited The growth primarily comes from lowend commodity semiconductor parts lowend mobile components semiconductor test and packaging and manufacturing at older generation nodes nm The manufacturing capabilities of Chinese OEMs will likely improve over the next five years but I find the Chinese governments push for domestic semiconductor development to be aggressive I find the growth targets to be unobtainable given Intels interest in lower cost commodity grade parts Furthermore when people refer to commodity parts Im referring to microcontroller units which have very basic logic circuits and network capabilities to communicate data via wireless spectrum to the cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes that its strategic shift into the cloud begins with their Quarkclass CPUs which creates direct competition for Chinese OEMs However Intels market position with its Quark MCU lineup is small <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>occupies roughly market share according to the investor day Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can penetrate into this market segment the Chinese government and local VCs will need to stepup investment The only problem with the Chinese approach Intels RD is funded with a growing revenue base As such I find it difficult for smaller scale fab operators and semiconductor designers to remain competitive assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is able to win major contracts with automobile companies and various other applianceelectronics manufacturers The degree to which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can penetrate into the space is subjective because there are a lot of moving parts but theres no denying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a performancecost advantage when compared to Chinese fabsdesign houses Its also worth noting that if you normalize the logic circuits between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture and competing CPUs manufactured from different fabs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a density advantage Higher is better in this instance and when you pack more transistors into a logic circuit the performance is enhanced As such Intels position within desktop and laptop grade CPUs have remained relatively stable as anyone attempting to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would need to have both a competitive design and a manufacturing edge Hence AMD NASDAQ AMD has lost substantial market share over the years and competing semiconductor brands have yet to come up with a clearcut strategy for penetrating into Intels competitive space Therefore investors should take into consideration Intels manufacturing advantage as it does translate into better performance at a lower cost per integrated circuit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also mentions that its cost per transistor decreases by with each generational transition However the company anticipates that this historical pattern may not hold up To be more specific they believe they can generate a better CPT improvement from historical trends as they progress through nm and nm manufacturing This all translates into higher gross margins once wafer yields stabilize As such investors should anticipate a higher return from every dollar invested into fabrelated RD as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>anticipate the costtobenefit ratio to progressively improve Higher RD is offset by a cost per transistor improvement despite the incremental CAPEX needs of each successive generation The upside from better manufacturing technologies is reflected in future gross margins whereas the upfront investment into future generation fabs is reflected in current FCF metrics Over time these new fabs squeeze out performance enhancements at a lower cost per transistor which directly translates into lower cost of goods sold later on down the road Of course it takes time to work off the incremental investment into a fab which is depreciated on an accelerated straight line basis Nonetheless the capital investment is offset through increasing volumes and falling cost per unit When looking at historical FCF to gross margin trends the companys free cash flow metrics are the worst in a successive twoyear cycle during Q QFY QFY and QFY forecast generate the lowest quarterly FCF However following the dropoff in FCF the gross margin tends to improve Furthermore theres a consistent uptrend in the lows and highs of gross margin in the past five years Each successive generation generates a higher gross profit rate due to efficiency gains The CFO anticipates a gross margin rate as we enter into the next investment phase for nm manufacturing This is pretty good because the cost improvements are also reflected through investment periods Once we exit out of FY well likely see a sizable improvement to gross margins perhaps to gross margins which would make the nm CPU family the most profitable assuming gross margin and FCF trends remain constant Therefore when pertaining specifically to Intels CAPEX and gross margin trends I remain optimistic While gross margins arent going to eclipse and to any meaningful extent were witnessing a pattern of improving profitability through each successive process node As such Intels EPS will be driven by profitability and revenue growth over the next five years I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Editors Note This
