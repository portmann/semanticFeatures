class='textDiv'>Dont Abandon Micron Just Yet Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha After finally steadying itself after earnings Micron has begun to slip again This is attributed to MA in the semiconductor space and Intels recent billion investment in its own flash memory plant There was plenty of selling in Micron NASDAQ MU yesterday This is one stock that cannot seem to get a grip on the direction that it wants to go If you have been reading us you know that we are bullish on Micron and have been for the last few months We believe that prices under per share for the company are a bargain and we believe that Micron in the long run is going to be just fine Its worth noting that we said the same exact thing about SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK when it began to fall in our article SanDisk Will Be Just Fine That was at around We had speculated that Micron is going to buck the trend in the semiconductor sector and we identified prices at or under as far too cheap for this company by most standards of valuation There were two new developments in the world of Micron over the last couple of weeks First there was a fair amount of speculation as to whether or not either Western Digital or Micron would be making a bid to buy out SanDisk This morning Western Digital NASDAQ WDC announced it was going to be buying SanDisk for per share SanDisk stock had suffered the same type of momentum problems due to the same sector wide problems as Micron You can see this in the below chart the only difference is that Micron is trading at a much deeper discount It had been rumored a week ago that Micron and Western Digital were both potential buyers that were listed to be bidding for SanDisk Yesterday it broke that SanDisk is in advanced talks to sell itself to Western Digital SanDisk stock popped and Micron stock which had already been lagging on the day sold off a bit further Today obviously we know that Western Digital was the winning bidder Then yesterday to add fuel to the fire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC announced that they are going to be putting billion into investing in converting a plant in China to produce memory chips The WSJ report read <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp plans to convert its semiconductor fabrication plant in China to make memory chips a strategy shift expected to cost at least billion over three to five years The chip maker said it may ultimately spend as much as billion on the plant in Dalian a city in northeastern China Intels move marks a return of sorts to its business roots and underscores the widening importance of memory technology in a broadening array of electronic products purchased by consumers and businesses It comes as slowing growth in other parts of the industry has prompted a wave of consolidation and China steps up efforts to build local technology manufacturing capacity The company based in Santa Clara Calif has long received the vast majority of its revenue from microprocessors and related chips <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>prides itself on shrinking such circuitry quickly to boost the capability of its products It has also kept close control over its production technology to prevent rivals from copying it Microns selloff began to accelerate and the company dropped more than during intraday trading yesterday Intels move to us makes some sense Making this investment and ignoring Micron after the two companies have just extended the terms of their partnership does not make sense Why would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>make this announcement after shoring up its partnership with Micron While trying to get to the bottom of it we read further into this Wall Street Journal article describing the investment and then serving up comments from both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron about the nature of this investment Besides standard versions of flash memory the two companies recently announced a new jointly developed memory technology called D XPoint that they said is much faster than conventional flash memory Rob Crooke senior vice president in charge of nonvolatile memory at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said in a blog post that the companys relationship with Micron remains strong But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wanted to have an additional source of supply of flash memory he said The expansion is part of our global multisource supply strategy and will allow us to best serve our customers Mr Crooke said A Micron spokesman also stressed that the two companies will remain close partners Micron in fact is considering using the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>factory in Dalian as another potential future component supplier for storage devices the company sells in addition to chips he said Neither company seems to be making the point that Micron is going to be excluded from this new plant If anything this new investment may provide synergies between the two companies and the chips that they have agreed to collectively produce It is a long shot and no one is talking about it but there is also an outside chance that this investment is being made specifically with Micron in mind How could an executive for Micron make a comment like that so quickly without prior knowledge of this news coming Does this move <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a step closer to potentially making a bid for Micron Does it warrant a massive selloff in MU stock Micron was just starting to recover This all came after an earnings report that finally seemed to calm investors and stop the bleeding from the company stock So yesterday we added to our Micron position because we do believe that Tsinghuas failed bid for the company may prompt other buyers to make offers and we continue to believe that Microns valuation even with its reduced guidance and the state of the semiconductor industry is too cheap to be ignored We think this valuation will drive the story As we saw with the PWCSierra deal mergers and acquisitions are starting to happen in the space This is obviously furthered by this mornings SanDisk announcement All of the logic and all of the pieces point to Micron being the next company to be dealt Its cheap its even cheaper on an enterprise value to earnings basis and its one of the only bigger names that is left We continue to be bullish on Micron and will be adding to our position should the
