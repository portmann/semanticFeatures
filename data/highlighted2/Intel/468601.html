class='textDiv'>Micron Technology Is In Play Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha Micron filed a rights offering on Friday July after the market close One of the two kingpins of the Hard Disk Drive industry Western Digital has acquired SanDisk in order to vertically integrate into the Solid State Drive business The other Hard Disk Drive kingpin Seagate is left without its own dedicated source of supply to vertically integrate into the Solid State Disk Drive industry Apple is the largest consumer of nonvolatile memory in the world and may want to vertically integrate like its smartphone rival Samsung Micron Technology NASDAQ MU has done a lot of shareholder unfriendly things in the past But last Fridays filing of a poison pill rights offering takes the cake The document bears the date of July But the time stamp on the SECs EDGAR server says it wasnt accepted by them until Why post something on Friday after the market close Why to lose it for publication and speculation in the weekend financial press Predictably Micron was rallying strongly in the Monday premarket and as this is written the stock is trading at up on the day What is a rights offering There are lots of good ideas around Here is one Essentially shareholders are given the right to purchase additional securities at a bargain rate once any shareholder goes over a set threshold In classic antitakeover scenarios this level is typically at of the outstanding shares This particular rights offering with a trigger of and with its language on Section of the IRS code is styled as a rights offering to prevent a change of control that would jeopardize the companys Net Operating Loss Carryforwards So why would this rights offering styled as one designed to preserve the companys NOLs expire in long before most of the NOLs expiry occurs Because this is an antitakeover rights offering masquerading as an NOL preservation rights offering with its attendant trigger point That trigger point is set so low in NOL preservation rights offerings since the IRS examines changes in position holders to determine whether there has been a change of control for tax purposes A trigger and the boards unilateral right to grandfather and exempt shareholders of their choosing and to change other terms of the rights offering gives the Micron board ownership of the auction hall and auctioneers gavel Who might Microns suitors be Much has been made of the Tsinghua bid for Micron and its unlikely success I happen to think that some foreign participation in a bid is possible despite the frequent citations of CFIUS as a defense As an example of sensitive transactions that have been possible under CFIUS Id offer up the sale of IBMs server business to Lenovo despite the fact that business underpins much of our missile technology Lockheed Martin Corp the worlds largest defense contractor by sales and the supplier of the Aegis Combat System said it is discussing the issue with the Navy In response to a question about the inclusion of IBM servers in the Aegis Combat System Keith Little a spokesman for Lockheed Martin said I can confirm that we are working with the US Navy to ultimately select an appropriate course of action But Id agree that a foreign buyer is not the likeliest suitor for Micron despite the fact that they might play in a deal as a financing source or licensee for some technologies Seagate Technology NASDAQ STX Seagate has watched recently as its competitor in the hard disk drive market Western Digital NASDAQ WDC gobbled up SanDisk to vertically integrate into the solid state drive market With a market cap of only billion Seagate could be viewed to be swallowing a relative whale Seagate is well known to the private equity world and spent a few years in the hands of tech buyout giant Silverlake before being taken public again Now Silverlake is even more fascinating in the nonvolatile memory market having enabled the going private transaction of Dell and now its lash up with storage giant EMC NYSE EMC Seagate needs to vertically integrate and so do Dell and EMC Apple NASDAQ AAPL Your scribe suggested Apple as a buyer back in November OK so maybe I was a bit early Now with Microns advancements in D NAND and D XPoint Apple might want to get at the head of both lines to freshen up its iPhone and iPad offerings Apple remains the largest buyer of computer memory in the world Its principal smartphone competitor Samsung OTCSSNLF is vertically integrated and must enjoy technology lead time and market timingdependent occasional cost advantages <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC SAs very own Russ Fischer once wrote that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needed to own Micron in order to compete with Samsung <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to be making quite a splash in memory with its investment of billion in Dalian China Perhaps life would be simpler for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>without another partner owning IP and sharing ownership of IMFT And to that last point there is a put and call agreement for IMFT But perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has run out of patience or feels ownership of Micron now would make life easier I ran a draft of this article by our own SAMicron resident counsel Retired Securities Attorney He reminded me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already has rights to acquire million shares expiring in See these SEC filings Those contain this key bit of information Standstill Provisions a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital shall not acquire directly or indirectly and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital to acquire directly or indirectly through market purchases or otherwise record or beneficial ownership of any Voting Securities of Micron representing when taken together with all securities owned by such Persons in excess of a percentage greater than nineteen and ninety nine hundredths the Standstill Percentage of the Total Voting Power of Micron without the prior written consent or approval of Microns Board of Directors provided however that the prior written consent or approval of the Board of Directors of Micron shall not be required for the acquisition of any Voting Securities of Micron pursuant to the conversion exchange or exercise of any of the Rights or any of the Additional Adjustment Rights or resulting from a stock split stock dividend or similar recapitalization by Micron or resulting from any issuance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital of Common Stock or other securities of Micron pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Business Agreement Nothing contained in this Section shall adversely affect any right of <span style='background-color:

benefit plans or pension plans shall not be beneficial ownership by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital for purposes of this Section So perhaps according to the penultimate sentence in that standstill agreement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not covered by last Fridays poison pill and has the unilateral right to acquire up to of Micron I have never seen an analyst delve into this important but arcane stuff as has our own RSA Kudos to RSA And what are the analysts saying The first firm out with a comment that Ive seen is Cowen on July th Heres their summary While the market is reading this as a precursor to a takeover and it very well could be we would note that given the sheer size of the NOL relative to its market cap this is a smart move Regarding potential acquirers INTC and China are obvious but neither are necessarily straightforward And heres a lot more color on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>INTC Market Perform is ultimately the most logical potential buyer and we have talked extensively about this but there are issues here too On one hand DXP made in its JV with MU is really a key to INTCs future in Data Center and the way the JV with MU works all of the rights flip in favor of MU at YE eg as of MU can buy INTC out of its stake at its own discretion see below But at this time MU doesnt have the money to buy INTC out so we doubt that INTC sees that as an existential threat to its memory efforts Also INTCs memory efforts currently are a year drag on EPS because unlike startup costs related to MPU it is spreading the startup costs for its Dalian China factory across a very small amount of NSG revenue Thus we are hard pressed to see INTC doubling down and committing that type of capital at this time to buy MU So it makes sense for INTC to ultimately own MU but with MU lacking the capital it would take to buy INTC out of the JV we would put this in the why buy when you can rent category Credit Suisse also issued a report on July favoring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or the Chinese as a buyer We believe that the new agreement increases that possibility of strategic investment or acquisition in near term There have been recent Media reports indicating that MU is in negotiation with China Inc on establishing a JV for NAND manufacturing and our recent checks suggest that INTC has slowed Dalian expansion we believe that China or INTC could be potential investors or acquirers On China as an investor CS dispenses this wisdom We expect that equity investment from China would trigger CFIUS review which is viewed as unlikely to come through in case of memory investment as a result investment is likely to be limited to equity investment And CS has this on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as an investor Note that INTC has been building new capacity at Dalian it could be cheaper for INTC to buy NAND capacity from MU than to invest in expanding new capacity at Dalian INTC could secure more capacity at MU by making an equity investment in MU that could give them access to greater bits produced at cost at MU The company could also acquire MU the acquisition would come with cost synergies duplication of RD related to SSD and cost of sales related to PCServer however may face regulatory hurdles SSDXPoint The acquisition will also allow INTC to increase scale in manufacturing Given replacement cost of bn we could see potential price at x times replacement cost assuming INTC buying for MUs Capacity which would imply offer as high as per share While I generally like Cowen and Credit Suisse Ill stick by my shortlist above and the order in which I ranked suitors Conclusions The Boise Idaho crowd has amply proven they are not a clever financial lot They didnt put in a poison pill merely to protect NOLs most of which expire long after the poison pill I believe they put in a poison pill because someone is leaning on their door bell I would find it hard to believe that the company couldnt fetch the share that is often bandied about replacement cost of billion implies In a report dated Credit Suisse put the replacement value at billion I was in Minnesota a couple of weeks ago and had a chance to visit the irrepressible Russ Fischer in a nursing home where he is still recovering from a series of strokes and where he is hopefully being weaned off a ventilator on which he must spend half the day I can report that his salty language and tough demeanor is still with us Hopefully hes reading a few SA articles and some research reports We talked briefly about innovations in WWII and I got a long discourse on the cavity magnetron Russs tech mind is still very much with us He will enjoy a run up and takeover of Micron Disclosure I amwe are long MU INTC I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking
