starting to hurt Qualcomm and I expect a rash of earnings downgrade to follow as the trend gathers steam Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM cant be all that happy with Samsungs OTCSSNLF decision to go inhouse for its applications processor and baseband components for the Galaxy S While the cost per device is higher for Samsung the decision may have been driven by wanting to have the best performing applications processor in the industry to rekindle demand for the Galaxy flagship Forecast sales of the Galaxy S run about million units this year That amounts to a billion bite out of Qualcomm sales more if the demand for the S runs ahead of initial forecasts which seems quite likely given the enthusiasm for the product TMobile reports initial orders for the device at twice the rate of last years Galaxy S While I was not surprised Samsung went inhouse for the AP the choice of its own baseband chip was a surprise and does not bode well for Qualcomm Samsungs ability to put out a nm AP and its

it is feeling from competition That competition is only going to heat up Most analysts project Qualcomm earnings per share will actually fall in its fiscal which ends in September with the average call at per share versus in I expect those projections will continue to fall with a more likely result in the range The analysts calls dont seem to adequately reflect the combination of the hole
