<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capitalize On The Silicon In Mobile Base Stations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has unique growth opportunities tied specifically to logic silicon in mobile base stations The company believes that through data center virtualization and disaggregation technologies the base station space is ripe for Intelbased architecture The performance advantage and cost advantage seems disruptive The segment is growing at times the industry CAGR and will scale into a billion a year business over the long run However its not exactly clear whether those assumptions are inflated Needless to say the growth from this segment isnt reflected in the longterm growth assumption of the DCG segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC went into great detail about Network Transformation but basically theres a huge opportunity in logic silicon TAM The market potential is estimated at billion according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and is very specific to mobile base stations Much of these mobile base stations run on ASICs which are highlyspecialized CPUunits that focus on a specific algorithmapplication However ASICs arent as effective as a medium for developing network scalability when compared to deployments with general purpose CPUs via a data center due to development cost and lack of flexibility with workloads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes that it can compete for these dollars due to the transition of mobile base station workloads to cloud virtualization Mobile carriers will transition workloads pertaining to packet application control and signal processing into the data center rather than processing the information on site at the base station <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is starting to build momentum as theyve deployed its CPUs into mobile base stations Over time they expect that they can gain more of the base station market as various telecoms are starting to experiment with data center based workloads versus onsite processing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>mentions that the environment these ASICs based systems operate in are very harsh With broad ranging weather conditions paired with the fact that the processing of these various workloads isnt as decentralized which means that the workload should be handled via a disaggregated system ie a server The efficiency gain comes from a combination of both hardware and software level acceleration along with data center architecture For largescale disaggregation to work <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Silicon Photonics is a requirement so various components can be disaggregated so resources can be quickly shared via separate systems In the case of base stations the bandwidth needs are much more extreme In a disaggregated system main system memory and storagebased needs can be increased based on the stated demand for those resources rather than buying an entirely new ISS industry standard system to make up for the difference in storage requirements or memory requirements for the entire data center So if more storage resources are required the data center designer can simply implement industry standard storage solutions into the disaggregated rack Facebook NASDAQ FB mentions in its annual technology conference that they have already accomplished largescale disaggregation which correspondingly lowers the cost of adding resources into the data center Disaggregation tackles the challenge of scale and cost and can be implemented in large scale data package processing and signal processing This explains why theres a huge opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to take its platform into mobile base stations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has developed technologies to help amplify the performance of packet processing through an Open Plane Development kit and Openvswitch The performance scaling from these technologies generated a performance improvement of times This is why Xeonbased systems can compete with ASICs based systems and in narrow use cases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can then implement FPGAs and coprocessors to close the performance between ASICs and general purpose CPUs Also for those of you who are wondering Openvswitch is the software aspect of enabling resource disaggregation through enabling a creation of crossserver switches which works within virtual machine hypervisors A virtual machine at the servers scale basically differentiates workloads and creates an independent environment for compute resources to be dedicated to specific programs When operated at scale there are huge cost advantages Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a position to displace competitors in the space through its proprietary hardware and software The company mentions that its currently at billion in annual revenue and its RD pertaining to this specific market segment has doubled The projected growth rate of the segment is at around times the market which is driven by saturating more of the available market share and broader trends in data usage These combined factors imply that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can eventually generate its longrun goal of billion in annual revenue from this specific market As you can tell billion in incremental revenue is enough to move the consolidated revenue figure for FY as the company generated billion in revenue and I anticipate flat revenue growth for FY So if PC sales continue to slump the growth will have to be driven by new business opportunities and new product categories In this case the incremental revenue opportunity is expected to become much more meaningful in FY onwards However the aggressive growth assumptions from network processing werent really factored much into the longrun CAGR assumption for the DCG Without knowing exactly what data consumption will be like in five years or if competing solutions can close the performance and cost advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believes it offers theres the potential that the revenue potential from this segment could be overstated On the other hand if implementation of virtualization takes course across all future mobile base stations then yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will corner the entire market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips provide the lowest total cost of ownership in any data center Therefore implementation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips in network virtualization seems like a pretty high probability but to the extent to which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can capitalize on the opportunity remains a bit of an uncertainty That being the case I continue to reiterate my hold recommendation and price target I think the longterm growth prospects and fundamentals will substantially improve in FY Therefore opening a position may mean outperformance over the long haul It will be awhile before sentiment around the stock improves which is why I think the stock will perform inline with the market this year Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
