<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Curie Computer Module Could Popularize Smart Clothing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Curie is a small inconspicuous computer module that can be added as a button to tshirts and jackets Wearables industry is not limited to watches and fitness wristbands The era of smartphones could lead to the age of smart clothing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is still not on board the money train of smartphones However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now one of the early birds trying to catch the first train toward the Internet of Things revolution The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Curie is a tiny x computer that is aimed for wearables and smart clothing Curies small size and decent compute performance compels me to believe that it could help the fashion industry come up with healthtracking antitheft protectionenabled tshirts jeans jackets jewelries and shoes Designer clothes that get sold for thousands of dollars each deserve an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Curie computer button Readytowear office attire clothes also are fit for the Curie Running shoes golf shoes swimming trunks and other athletic gear could be more useful if they come with embedded Curie computers A Curiepowered wristband was even used to control robots I strongly believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could sell million smartphone application processors this year I also believe that smartphones are still bigger chip clients than smart clothes However the main advantage of focusing on smart wearable application processors is that the competition is not yet crowded Curie wont have to compete with so many ARMbased SoC licensors Smart wearables also are a nascent industry where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could beat ARMbased SoCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already owns Wind River Systems and its Real Time Operating Systems The Curie is a great example where a lowpower x <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Quark computer could become a decent moneymaker using Wind Rivers software Curie could be a ticket to the multibillion potential of selling smart clothing smart bags smart shoes and other things that men and women like to wear People of today and tomorrow will increasingly use embedded computers not only on their watches but also on their work leisure and exercise attire The Internet of Everything concept allows for current nonelectronic gadgets like tshirts and jackets to also serve as health fitness trackers and data storage systems The other category definitely includes clothing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already demonstrated last year that an SDcard size Quarkpowered Edison computer could be used for baby monitor onesies An <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Edison computer also was used to create a D printed smart dress Curie is smaller than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Edison board Dressmakers and factories could easily disguise the Curie as a button in a business jacket or evening gown Like the Edison Curie has sensors to monitor a persons heart rate and steps taken Curie also supports Bluetooth LE for wireless transfer of data from smart clothes to computerssmartphones Curies Bluetooth LE connectivity also could eventually allow autonomous machinetomachine communication <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is giving away a software development kit so that manufacturers could create customized software for Quark SoCpowered smart devices While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already has multiple partnership deals with watchmakers and eyewear companies I firmly believe that Curie is fit to be embedded inside tshirts jackets and dresses If Louis Vuitton OTCPK LVMHF group trusted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for its first Tag Heuer Android smart watch I believe that luxury bags and designer clothes also deserve a Curie module inside them Curie is small enough to be inconspicuous so that finicky socialites wont notice it Furthermore Intels advanced Internet of Things hardware solutions has made it possible for SMS Audio to create batteryless smart earbuds that could monitor heart beats Yes there are ARMbased solutions for Internet of Things devices However the expertise of Wind River Systems on embedded computers and operating systems allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to offer an endtoend Internet of Things ecosystem Wind River and the newly acquired Lantiq assets are two significant factors that give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>an edge when it comes to smart clothing While Wind River Systems is famous for embedded industrial and commercial applications Lantiq a fabless semiconductor company is known for supplying hardwaresoftware solutions to manage connected devices inside the digital home Smart clothings gathered data ought to also transmit itself automatically to smart thermostats and humidifiers This is to make sure the inhabitants get maximum comfort The intelligent thrust of Intels Internet of Things strategy is that every smart device ought to be online and be capable of securely communicating with each other The predictive algorithm of I Know First is strongly hinting that INTC is currently undervalued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has positive day and day forecast scores There is a good probability that investors who dare bet on INTC right now could win a decent reward in the future There are other expert analysts also still endorsing a Buy for INTC The longterm technical indicators are in line with my Buy rating for <span
