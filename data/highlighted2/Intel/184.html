class='textDiv'>Intels SellOff Might Continue But Get Your Buy Orders Ready <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has significantly underperformed the broad market since the start of the year Some of its decline might be due to investors taking profits after a huge rally in but there seems to be a bigger set of issues at play Investors are once again questioning Intels growth prospects since the PC market continues to shrink and Intels mobile business is fraught with problems But just as the pervasive negativity set the stage for Intels massive rally last year the same dynamic could soon play out again While I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can continue to decline below per share if it does it will be a fantastic buying opportunity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC had a fantastic run last year The stock performed extremely well rising approximately not including dividends After such fantastic performance its not unreasonable to see a dip Indeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is now about off its week high But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>isnt a typical case of a highflying stock correcting due to a lofty valuation In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was still fairly cheap on a valuation basis even at its week high Rather something else appears to be going on with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Specifically I believe there are some very real reasons why the stock is coming down and these challenges are significant enough to lay the tracks for a continued selloff But the good news is should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continue to trade lower it will once again set up a great buying opportunity When a company sees its most important market shrink its cause for concern Thats exactly whats happening to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as it relates to the personal computer In a recent report IDC stated that global PC shipments fell in the fourth quarter last year PC sales were million for the quarter down from million units the previous year Not only is the declining PC market cause for concern but the nature of PC sales is changing as well IDC noted that consumer purchasing decisions were based on simply refreshing very old PCs It would be far more encouraging to see that consumers were buying new PCs because they really wanted to not simply because they had to In addition IDC estimated that some fourthquarter production was attributed to getting ahead of holidayrelated production constraints in Asia in the first quarter This means the betterthanexpected fourth quarter results likely just shifted volume from early into the end of This sets the stage for a disappointing first quarter shipment total This matters a great deal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since PCs still constitute the majority of Intels business Intels revenue totaled billion last year of which billion came from its PC business That means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still derives of its revenue from personal computers This is significantly weighing on Intels growth prospects PC revenue grew just which overshadowed much stronger performance in Intels highergrowth areas such as data centers and the Internet of Things where revenue grew and last year respectively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still chained to the PC and equally troubling is the fact that Intels venture into the mobile business has gone very poorly As if the decline in the personal computer industry Intels biggest market werent bad enough investors have a separate problem on their hands which is Intels very poor performance in mobile At the beginning of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CEO Brian Krzanich vowed to get Intels chips into million tablets by the end of the year To be sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>actually succeeded on its goal and then some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shipped million tablets last year But this is not cause for celebration The reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was able to ship so many tablets is because it offered massive subsidies to device makers This was essentially a pricewar strategy and created contrarevenue that deducts from sales growth and at rising volumes Intels mobile losses escalated quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>lost billion in mobile last year up from a billion loss in Contra revenue actually caused <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to report negative revenue in mobile in the fourth quarter For mobile revenue collapsed to just million I believe that investors now seriously doubt Intels mobile strategy and are beginning to worry about the very viability of Intels mobile business This uncertainty is compounded by Intels decision to consolidate its mobile and PC businesses Going forward these two businesses will report under the same operating segment This seems like a weak attempt to hide the mobile business Fortunately investors should take comfort in the fact that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to selloff it will create a fantastic buying opportunity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>looks cheap now but as we all know even cheap stocks can get cheaper If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>keeps falling investors will have a great opportunity to initiate a new position at a very favorable price or add to their existing position Thats because despite Intels troubles the company is still massively profitable and generates a ton of free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>produced billion of free cash flow last year Not only does the company generate huge cash flow but it returns a lot of it to investors The company paid billion of dividends meaning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>maintains a very comfortable free cash flow payout ratio In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought back billion of stock Investors are likely questioning Intels growth prospects just as they did a few years ago before Intels massive rally Back then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>got too cheap and if the stock continues to decline it will once again become too cheap This is the alltootypical pattern of investors overreacting Pervasive negativity is exactly what set the stage for Intels rally last time Because of this there will reach a point when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is once again a screaming buying opportunity I dont think were there just yet given its various challenges but if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>trades below per share it will trade for just times earnings which will be a big enough discount considering the companys issues At that point Ill consider buying shares Source Intels SellOff Might Continue But Get Your Buy Orders Ready
