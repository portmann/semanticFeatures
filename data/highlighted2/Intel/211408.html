declined Microsofts request that it resell the Surface Pro Microsofts move to sell highend laptops makes it a rival of Lenovo Lenovo released its flagship Yoga Windows laptop and Yoga Home tabletopallinone desktop computer Unlike Dell and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY declned a request last year from Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT that it resell the popular Surface Pro Gianfranco Lanci President of Lenovo told The Register that he rejected Microsofts offer because his company will never be a reseller of a rivals product Lenovo the worlds largest PC vendor apparently now sees Microsofts ambitious plan to become a highend PC vendor as something to be wary of While Lenovo is a major backer of the Windows PC platform I think Lanci believes the commercial success of the Surface Pro million units sold in Q according to Canalys is a threat to its core PC business According to Gartner the PC business again declined by during the Q period Lenovo obviously doesnt want to help Microsoft to grow and become another rival in the alreadyshrinking PC market Except for Dell and Apple NASDAQ AAPL all other top PC vendors suffered a decline in PC shipments during in Q of this year Lenovo shipped fewer PC products in Q compared to what it shipped out in Q I opine that Lenovo might be wary that Microsofts first taste of success with the Surface Pro could eventually lead that software giant to expand its PC portfolio to include desktop computers Microsofts firstever highend laptop the Surface Book already is getting impressive preorder purchases Aside from targeting only the highend sector Microsoft also released the Surface earlier this year This sub price segment is where most Lenovomade laptops are being sold Lenovo knows all too well that theres really nothing stopping Microsoft from branching out to sub desktop computers Instead of helping an emerging rival like Microsoft market the Surface Pro Lenovo unveiled yesterday its own flagship Windows laptop the Yoga The Lenovo Yoga is an alternative to the Surface Book It also features the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC sixth Generation Core Skylake processors Like the Surface Book the Yoga is a convertible notebooktablet computer Its the muchimproved successor the Yoga Pro The four form factor notebook stand tent tablet modes of the Yoga Pro is retained but Lenovo did away with the Broadwell Core M processor and replaced it with the more powerful sixth Gen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core i and Core i processors Lenovo also improved the watchband hinge to make the degree functionality of the Yoga provide smoother transition to its different form usage Lenovo also bumped up the maximum RAM of the Yoga to GB improved the battery life and gave it JBL Speakers and Dolby Audio Premium features This clearly makes it a real portable workstation for creative professionals involved in videoaudio editing The chart below reveals the Yoga targets both the market segments of Surface Pro and Surface Book Lenovo wants enterprise users and design professionals to consider the Yoga as an alternative to Microsofts convertible laptops The chart above also reveals the new Yoga Home Its Lenovos latest inch tabletopallinone desktop computer Microsoft has not yet released its tabletop computer the PixelSense The Yoga Home is a touchscreen allinone computer that is akin to the iMac that also functions as a tabletop computer for collaborative use when its laid down on a table As you can see from the screen below the Yoga Home is a pound portable computer that also can be used outdoors as a giant tablet PC Lenovo has been a proponent of the tabletop PC for productivity purposes The older inch Lenovo Horizon AIO computer is popular among DJs and live performance dance music maestros Microsoft might eventually release its own PixelSense tabletop computergiant tablet for the enterprisecreative markets Again Lenovo will reject any future request to resell this Microsoft tabletop because the Chinese firm already has a competing product Lenovo did right in rejecting the request of Microsoft As a leader in PC sales Lenovo cannot feed the ambitious plan of Microsoft to be more like Apple On the contrary Lenovo has greater benefits if it sells cheaper versions of Microsofts highend computer products Not only will Lenovo slow down the growth of Microsoft as a PC vendor Lenovo might even win the loyalty of some customers who cannot afford the Surface Book The most expensive version of the Yoga is only which already touts the Core i Skylake processor GB RAM and GB solidstate drive flash storage The basic Surface Book already sold out only has Core i Skylake GB of RAM and GB of SSD storage Sad but true Microsoft doesnt have its own factories to assemble the very indemand Surface Book Fortunately Lenovo has the production capacity to churn out millions of units of the Yoga A customer who becomes aware of the cheaper Yoga will likely buy it instead of the outofstock Surface Book Furthermore I do not think Lenovo will preinstall any thirdparty apps on highend computers like the Yoga and Yoga Home The Superfish scandal was only due to Lenovos need to improve its margins on cheap computers Enterprise customers therefore will not be wary of buying these latest highend computers from Lenovo LNVGY is worth a buyin right now Lenovo is headed in the right direction in focusing more on highermargin computers It doesnt really matter if Lenovo loses its top vendor status by selling less cheap computers and more units of midrange and highend PCs like the Yoga My point is that any computer vendor is in a losing proposition if it insists on catering mostly to lowerincome customers Lenovo has the technology resources and engineers to come up with highquality premium PC products that could win big in the lucrative enterprise and creative industry markets If a newbie PC vendor like Microsoft is aiming to steal the customers of Macs a seasoned OEM like Lenovo also should be daring enough to target the highlyprofitable niche market for pricey laptops and desktop
