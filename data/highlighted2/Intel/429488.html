Seeking Alpha AMD is unlikely to release its nm Zenbased processors this year Theres no compelling reason for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to release the successor to Skylake processors Releasing the Kaby Lake processors this year is not going to reverse the declining PC market Delaying it will help PC vendors unload their unsold BroadwellSkylakebased computers The current nm Skylake processors are good enough until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gets working nm CannonLake processors The small incremental CPU speed increase from Kaby Lake is not going to compel people to buy new laptops or desktop computers I explained why Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD is not in a hurry to rollout its firstever nanometer Zen processors Intels NASDAQ INTC unsold inventories of Core and Atom processors is one of the reasons why it would be unhealthy for AMD to release Zen processors this year Well Im also using the same unsold inventory justification to propose that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to delay or even cancel Kaby Lake Digitimes shares my view that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD will not launch new processors this year due to weak PC demand Digitimes explained that this alleged postponement is due to the upstream supply chain having a serious inventory issues In other words Intels PC partners has significant stockpile of unsold th and th generation x processors If Im Krzanich I will avoid dumping Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake on already hardup PC manufacturers Give these PC vendors some time to unload all their dustgathering Broadwell and Skylakeequipped computers If Im Acer or Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY I will be frustrated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is releasing new processors while I am still losing money housing unsold inventories of Broadwellbased laptops and desktop PCs IDC has issued another warning that the PC market is going to decline this year If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>truly respects its PC vendor partners it will withhold new processors to persuade people to buy whatever is available I will cancel the nm Kaby Lake and Apollo Lake and wait years before releasing the nm Cannonlake processors This grace period will give PC makers enough time to dispose all of their existing PC inventories Common sense tells me that releasing a new processor that has no significant improvements over Skylake is inappropriate during these trying PC industry conditions The current set of Skylake which Kaby Lake is supposed to succeed processors are therefore already good enough to last until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>comes up with nm processors Im also confident that even if AMD releases its nm Zenbased CPUs the highend Skylake Core i models will still outperform them Learned PC buyers already know that Kaby Lake is likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>trying to squeeze more money out of its nm process Smart PC gamers and Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Premiere users like me can confidently say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has not made any significant improvement on CPU performance since Ivy Ridge We know that an Ivy Bridge Core i or Core i CPUs paired with decent GPU cards are good enough to even ignore Skylake Hardware Unboxed tested all the past and current generations of Core i and Core i Im long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>so I will just let the charts below illustrate how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been content on making token improvements over the last four years I selected the CPUintensive Civilization Beyond Earth game because it can reflect the CPUGPUpunishing job of editingrendering full HD p videos on Adobe Premiere Based on CPUGPU gamesperformance metrics the Skylake Core iK only delivers a average fps boost than my threegeneration older Core i Ivy Bridge Even if Kaby Lake delivers more fps the performance boost is still not enough incentive to replace our Ivy Bridgeera computers I also do not like that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT will not support Windows on Kaby Lake Most fortysomething graphic artists like me still need Windows to use our old software like the era Freehand MX My Freehand MX cannot installrun properly on Windows I Know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>confirmed Kaby Lake for during the Computex Event However making struggling PC manufacturers buy Kaby Lake during this troubled PC market period is unfair and unnecessary Kaby Lake is an anomaly that doesnt follow the proven ticktock strategy of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>It deserves to be cancelled There is no economic value in Kaby Lake other than it being a minor update to Skylake The promise of faster integrated GPU performance in Kaby Lake is not a strong incentive for PC gamers and multimedia editors like me We use discreet Radeon or Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA GPUs to boost our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs Kaby Lakes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>GT HD integrated GPU is not going to make any major improvement over the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Iris Pro iGPUs poor performance when used under demanding gamesvideo editing tasks The only reason to buy Kaby Lake is its support of Optane or D Xpoint nonvolatile RAM Other than that it has no other reason to exist with Skylake already available However I will only accept Optane compatibility as compelling feature for Kaby Lake if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is actually ready to sell me D Xpoint memory at reasonable prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not yet selling any Optane SSD or Optane DIMM products I know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has set aside billion last year to convert its China factory into a memory plant However I understood its for D NAND memory not D Xpoint Im still long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but Im reducing my exposure to diversify my portfolio I really do not see any compelling purpose in releasing Kaby Lake I pray it gets cancelled this year so that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will have something really new when it comes out with Cannonlake Disclosure I amwe are long INTC MSFT ADBE NVDA I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
