class='textDiv'>Apple Thinking Outside The iPad Box Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha iPads sales declines point to the need for Apple to do more to stay relevant to the evolving tablet market The expected iPad Pro will boost sales but probably not enough Continuing declines in iPad sales point to the need for constructive action to reverse the trend Apple NASDAQ AAPL appears to be on the verge of taking that action in the form of a larger iPad Pro equipped with true multitasking via iOS In late I had hoped Apple would stem the decline of iPad sales this year However Im no longer convinced that a refreshed iPad lineup and new iPad Pro will be enough to restore sales growth Neil Cybart wrote a very thought provoking article about iPad Apple Finding iPads Future in which he observed that iPad was at risk of becoming irrelevant without a new direction for iPad I found myself agreeing that a new direction is needed Where I disagree with Neil is in some specific data and perhaps in my disposition towards the iPad Neil says theres something about the iPad that just doesnt sit right with me He then goes on to voice the oftrepeated criticism that iPad is just for content consumption In contrast Ive never seen the content consumption aspect of iPad as a negative Ive owned iPads and still have although the older ones are mostly used for app testing Ive seen how the iPad enables uses of personal computing devices that just werent possible with a conventional laptop such curling up with a good ebook or an episode of Marco Polo For me the iPad has all but taken over PC functions such as web browsing email checking and instant messaging Its also the only thing I use for video calling via Facetime As much as some may disdain content consumption it is after all what most of us were doing with our PCs outside of work before the advent of the iPad The iPad has made those activities both more convenient and more environmentally friendly reducing energy consumption From my personal standpoint theres no danger of irrelevance However Cybart puts forth a broader case than his personal viewpoint and that needs to be addressed For one Cybart points to the declines in year over year sales growth as proof that iPad has long been in decline I have a problem with his methodology As a products sales grow quarter after quarter the yy comps become increasingly difficult Rarely does a product manage to sustain percent sales increases since this requires greatly increasing sales in absolute terms Most consumer products go through a sales trajectory that is parabolic There is an initial rise then a leveling off followed by a decline This is illustrated in the chart below of iPad sales since inception plotted on a quarterly basis based on Apples earnings reports Ive also provided a smoothed curve fit of the data that illustrates the parabolic trajectory of iPad sales Although I would argue that a parabolic trajectory is normal for most consumer products the brevity of iPads trajectory I dont consider normal or natural I consider it primarily an effect of Intels NASDAQ INTC tablet processor giveaway that began in Q and continues to the present In the red line I show what Apples sales trajectory would have looked like if Intels tablet processor unit sales reported in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>quarterly earnings were added to iPad sales The plot represents an upper bound to iPad sales without the effect of Intels subsidized tablet processors Its arguable of course how much of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>tablet sales Apple would have captured It could be argued that Intels tablet processors went into low cost tablets where Apple wouldnt have been competitive anyway But I wouldnt conclude that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>based tablets therefore had no effect on iPad sales Through giving away highly capable Bay Trail processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>created a special category of low cost tablet that was much more capable and competitive with iPad performance than would otherwise have existed The effect was to drain away a significant portion of iPad sales This was illustrated by IDCs research findings for the tablet market in Q the back to school quarter IDC reported The top was rounded out by RCA which achieved its position by shipping million units primarily in one country the US The RCA tablets featured Intels nearly free tablet processors and were dirt cheap Budget minded parents apparently bought them assuming that they were an acceptable substitute for iPad Q was the first and only time that RCA has appeared in IDCs top five list of global tablet vendors Even though I believe that iPad sales have declined prematurely based on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>effect theres no doubt about the overall decline in the tablet market that started in Q of last year Cybart points to the lack of utility for work and content creation as the culprit He thinks people might well prefer a combination of smartphone and ultra portable laptop Im inclined to agree that the pure tablet form factor doesnt lend itself easily to traditional work place tasks and this is certainly true of the iPad This isnt really true in the Windows world where Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has essentially solved the problem of how to make the tablet relevant in the workplace Through Windows Surface and the host of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>based in hybrid laptops Microsoft has demonstrated how the tablet stays relevant through convergence Apple has kind of painted itself into a corner on this topic By eschewing convergence Apple has limited the market for its tablets unnecessarily Thats going to begin to change with the next generation of iPads especially the much rumored large size inch iPad Pro In addition to the larger screen which is really essential for a lot of content creation tasks the Pro will feature iOS multitasking also essential for doing real work Whether the iPad Pro will be competitive with Windows tablets or convertibles remains to be seen Im inclined to think not Windows is a full fledged desktop class OS that is provisioned with full tablet support iOS isnt really in the same league of capability even though its an excellent tablet OS Apples decision not to build touch screen capability into Mac OS X is really whats hurting it the most Sure a Mac OS X laptop or hybrid with a touch screen would cannibalize iPad sales So what Thats just the price of innovation iPhone cannibalized iPod but looked at another way iPod simply evolved into iPhone Ironically I believe that Mac OS X would require very little modification in order to be touch screen enabled OS X already seamlessly integrates standard touch screen UI features such as app full screen mode and an icon based app launcher As a hybrid OS OS X would provide a better integrated and more consistent UI than even Windows I believe that market forces will eventually compel Apple to change course on touch screen equipped Mac OS X devices For the time being Apple seems to want to approach the problem from the other direction building more capability into iOS This may work but Im doubtful Increasingly the problem for iPad especially in enterprise is that Apple is trying to compete iOS with Windows Thats a very lopsided competition Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
