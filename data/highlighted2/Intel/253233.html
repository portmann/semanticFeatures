class='textDiv'>Qualcomm Reels In A Big Fish Xiaomi Qualcomm Inc NASDAQQCOM Seeking Alpha Qualcomm and Xiaomi have signed a GLTE modem licensing agreement Qualcomm appears to be wellpositioned both in commodity ARM processors and IP licensing The announcement that Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has reached a licensing agreement with Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has a number of interesting implications First the agreement implies that Xiaomi is itself working on its own custom system on chip SOC for which it needs a modem license from Qualcomm Xiaomi wouldnt need a license otherwise This means that Xiaomi intends to join a select but growing club of smartphone makers that are designing their own SOCs including Apple NASDAQ AAPL Samsung OTCSSNLF Huawei and LG The agreement also points to Qualcomms future as an IP supplier within the custom SOC paradigm Finally the agreement demonstrates how empty the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC threat in smartphones has become The Xiaomi agreement does not itself remove the logjam in licensing as a result of Chinese chip makers who have been dragging their feet The concern about licensing revenue that emerged with Qualcomms September quarterly earnings report remains but it should be somewhat alleviated by the news Xiaomi is obviously very important in China and its agreement should lend forward momentum to the licensing process Xiaomi is making it clear to other Chinese companies that licensing Qualcomms technology is the right thing to do Xiaomis move also puts the commodity chip makers on notice that theyre in danger of becoming irrelevant As the paradigm shift spreads downward in the smartphone market from the top tier players such as Apple and Samsung the very raison detre for the commodity suppliers is lessened But of course not eliminated The agreement with Xiaomi also points very clearly to where Apple needs to go Apple needs to get LTE modem capability integrated into its custom SOCs and licensing a Qualcomm modem is clearly the most direct route to this objective Qualcomm has the most advanced modem technology available and it has demonstrated that the modems can be integrated onto the SOC silicon All the rumors weve been hearing about Apple using an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>modem will probably come to nothing The modem that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is developing is already inferior to what Qualcomm has in the X series and is only at the standalone stage The scenario that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls portray is that Apple will patiently wait for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to finish the modem so it can use it in the iPhone With Qualcomm Apple doesnt have to wait and it can start work right now on incorporating Qualcomm modem technology directly into its SOCs If you were Apple what would you do I think the choice is pretty obvious The train has already left the station When I think about the competitive positions of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm in smartphones especially in light of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>revealed at their Investor Meeting I view Qualcomm as being in the much stronger position Although there were some face saving statements made at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor meeting its clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has all but given up in smart phones Intels current smartphone processor the Atom X is already inferior as it stands in processor performance and in modem capability The processor cores are Silvermont class fabricated on TSMCs nm process The CPU capability is in no way competitive with ARM processors of the Cortex A class which has become standard in ARM commodity SOCs such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon The modem is G so its not going to be competitive in any developed market or even in China At the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management couldnt give an example of a single smartphone produced anywhere in the world that uses the X All they were able to say is that their Chinese partners for the X Spreadtrum and Rockchip are working on it After more than a year after the partnership announcements theyre still working on it Id be surprised if they ever bring products to market The X is already so obsolete <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has failed to win significant smartphone share and its tablet processor sales are collapsing now that contra revenue is being curtailed Its become increasingly clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has for all practical purposes given up trying to compete with ARM for smartphones and lightweight tablets The fact that Qualcomm has chosen to align with ARM and has invested in designing its own custom SOCs and CPU cores are key advantages that give Qualcomm an advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Intels plans to move the X to its own nm process and finally incorporate its LTE modem sometime next year wont help The Atom X and X have already been moved to nm and theyre still not competitive with the top tier ARM processors such as the current Apple A or the Exynos in the Samsung Galaxy S By the time the X moves to nm it will be further behind Samsung will have started production of the Exynos series which features its own custom designed CPU cores and so will Qualcomm with the Snapdragon There will also be SOCs from Huawei and probably LG that feature the next generation ARM Cortex A design My point is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>isnt a threat to Qualcomm or anyone else in the ARM community All <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing is falling further behind and Im not at all convinced that X will actually be moved in house There isnt any point At Tuesdays Credit Suisse Technology Media and Telecom Conference Qualcomm President Derek Aberle presented and he was asked specifically about the status of the plan I bring this up partly because I have received comments indicating some confusion about the status of the plan with regard to possible restructuring of the company That part of the plan is still in work as Aberle made clear in this quote from SAs transcript Yes so we announced a few months ago that we were going to look at a number of things including the corporate structure as well as our capital return strategy and we are going to have this kind of comprehensive review We said we are going to actually conclude that by the end of the calendar year so within this month and our intent would be to announce it shortly after we conclude it I want to be very careful of not saying anything that maybe red signaling one way or the other because this is not just a management decision this is all the way up to the Board and we have got two new independent directors that are on the Board and involved in this So I dont want to get ahead of that process What I will say is weve the company has been quite successful in the current structure historically there has been a lot of value delivered both to QUALCOMM and the industry but we are constantly evaluating things based on changes in the industry changes in our business and really are just trying to have an open mind to take a fresh look at this But we will have an answer on it pretty soon It aint over till its over But in fact I expect the announcement to be anticlimactic As things stand right now Qualcomm cant afford to spin off the chip business and go to a pure licensing model Chip sales represent the lions share of Qualcomms revenue and most importantly support all the RD and engineering development for the company which takes place in the QCT business unit Licensing revenue alone would not be able to support a licensing only business model assuming that significant RD would be transferred into a standalone licensing entity Clearly Qualcomm needs to adapt to the changing competitive landscape Custom SOCs are only going to become more important in smartphones and tablets Life will tend to get harder for commodity chip suppliers like Qualcomm On the other hand I dont think Qualcomm needs to worry about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Qualcomms main competitors will continue to be other commodity ARM suppliers such as MediaTek Qualcomm has demonstrated that it can compete in that market As I have pointed out its been doing that all year Qualcomm is much better positioned in the Internet of Things than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as well so I consider that a growth opportunity for Qualcomm And of course licensing is only going to become more important as the industry increasingly adopts the custom SOC paradigm The big move that Qualcomm could make right now that would really get investors excited is licensing a modem to Apple Qualcomm should push very hard to make that happen even if it requires some cost concessions Such an agreement would leave Intels modems dead in the water as well as position Qualcomm as the preeminent supplier of modem IP Since both Samsung and Huawei are putting their own LTE modems in their next generation SOCs this makes a licensing deal with Apple all the more urgent I consider the prospects for a licensing deal with Apple in to be very good Im still a little cautious about Qualcomm and rate it a hold but that may change once the
