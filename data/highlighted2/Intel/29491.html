style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>betting on a better second half After the bell on Tuesday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC reported its first quarter earnings The Q results were basically in line with lowered expectations after the companys March revenue warning Management lowered its full year revenue and gross margin forecast as the PC space is not performing as hoped In this article I look at some key takeaways from the companys report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reported Q revenues of billion just below the billion midpoint the company guided to with its Q revenue warning Perhaps more interesting was the Q revenue midpoint of billion That figure was a bit below the billion analysts were looking for Dont forget thanks to the warning the Q average estimate had come down from billion already This basically sets up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a second half of story First quarter revenues were up a paltry million and the midpoint of the Q forecast implies a million decline over the prior year period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guided for full year revenues to be approximately flat so to reach that point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would need more than million in revenue growth in the second half of the year One of the items I discussed in my earnings preview was the expected million in mobile profitability improvement the company expects in Management did state it is on track to meet this goal this year stating on the confrence call that it expects a majority of this improvement to occur in the back half of the year Investors are hoping this second half story materializes because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>spent a lot of money in recent quarters to buy back shares at an average price approaching If shares end up back in the high s that buyback will look quite foolish Intels second largest revenue segment was already its biggest growth driver but the PC decline only reinforces its importance In fact Intels financial reporting structure change now highlights the Data Center Group even more In Q the DCG had the highest operating profit of any business segment Thats due to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>merging its mobile group with the PC Client Group causing the new Client Computing Group to absorb mobiles roughly billion quarterly operating loss The Data Center Group reported a increase in revenues for Q over the prior year period The rest of the company reported a roughly revenue decline for the period Management is still looking to grow revenues in the DCG in the mid teens for the near future and that growth is certainly needed Without it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would be reporting more yearly revenue declines If the group can achieve midteens revenue growth for the next few years one analyst believes the segment could represent of Intels revenues by Analysts kept trying to bring up MA on the conference call but as expected those questions were shot down by management Recent rumors about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acquiring Altera NASDAQ ALTR have many buzzing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>trying to make a big purchase to help future growth There were a couple of interesting items in this quarterly report that might increase speculation of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acquisition First the company slashed its capex budget for to billion This is a billion cut from the prior forecast and also would be the companys lowest capex level in a number of years Management stated that the reduction was due to increased reuse of capital on nm and the alignment of capacity with demand Whether you believe managements wording or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is freeing up a bit of capital here Additionally the company slowed down its share repurchase plan tremendously in Q Just million was spent to buyback shares in the first quarter after about billion during the second half of Cutting back on the buyback and capex will lead some to believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is gearing up for a major acquisition whether it be Altera or another firm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares rallied a bit on Wednesday as it appears many were relieved that the report was not terrible Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did take down its revenue forecast as expected and the gross margin forecast was reduced as well However the company is still guiding for flat revenues at this point That is symbolic in the sense that management is not expecting a revenue decline Net income and earnings per share will most likely decline as increased costs pressure the bottom line Intels restructuring costs are also adding up and you would like to see those evaporate before long In terms of the PC space the launch of Windows later this year will be key for Intels top line number The PC industry is showing a decline right now with the hopes that shipments will improve as the year progresses If all goes well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might be able to show revenue growth in Since the report could have been worse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares jumped on Wednesday This relief rally helped the stock cross a couple of key points First by jumping above a share the annual dividend yield is now back below Additionally shares broke above their day moving average as seen in the chart below The next key technical line is the day which is another dollar plus from where shares closed Wednesday Overall Intels report was generally in the ballpark of expectations Because things could have been worse shares rallied on the news Q is set up to be a down period and management expects a better second half of the year Thanks to the new reporting structure the Data Center segment will be the star of the show offsetting weakness from the PC group For investors looking for growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not exactly where you want to be right now thanks to PC industry weakness However the stock offers a decent dividend right now and the company is buying back stock It will be interesting to see if there is a large acquisition announced in the next few months and to see how the launch of Windows plays
