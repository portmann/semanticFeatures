Seeking Alpha The rumors are true Xiaomi is expanding to notebook computers Inventecs chairman confirmed his company is assembling custom Linux laptops for Xiaomi I previously wrote about the rumors that Xiaomi was branching out to selling notebook computers The previous gossip was Xiaomi will use an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC x processor to power its custom Linux copycat version of the Apple NASDAQ AAPL MacBook Air Well Inventec Corp the Original Design Manufacturer ODM from Taiwan confirmed this rumor of a Xiaomi laptop Richard Lee Chairman of Inventec made this official confirmation via Taipei Times three days ago While Mr Lee did not specifically confirm that Inventec is using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors for the Xiaomi computers he did say that commercial launch would commence as early as st quarter of next year I opine that Inventec will most likely use an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU simply because Xiaomi is trying hard to copy the Intelusing MacBook There is no official image of the final laptop design However we can just remove the MacBook Air emblem and put Mi or MiBook Air instead from Apples laptop to get an idea of what the Xiaomi Linux laptop could look like Since Apple found it prudent to consistently ignore the x processors from Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD Consequently its imitator Xiaomi is also unlikely to use them in its first laptop product Intels huge RD spending has made its x CPUs far more advanced than AMDs best processors Inventec Appliance Corp is designingassembling the Xiaomi Linux laptop in its China factory Along with Foxconn Inventec is one of the top assemblers for Intelpowered notebook computers in China Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT also hired Inventec to help Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY and Acer come up with lowcost sub Windows notebooks using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom Bay TrailT processors There is therefore great probability that Inventec will also use a CPU from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for Xiaomis first laptop computer The decision to use Linux is easily explained by the fact that Microsoft will never allow its proprietary Windows OS to be customized by Xiaomi Xiaomi needs an opensource OS like Linux so it could modify it to look like Mac OS X This is how Xiaomi had its initial success as a smartphone vendor It modified Android OS with MIUI to look like iOS so it complements the iPhonelike design aesthetics of its sub Android phones There is a huge business opportunity in exploiting the Chinese fans of Apple that cannot afford the luxury pricing of iPhones and MacBooks The blockbuster success of the iPhone in China does not overshadow the fact that Xiaomi remains the topselling vendor of smartphones in that country Since Apple is unable to stop the copycat designs of Xiaomi an Intelpowered sub MacBook clone could attract the interest of millions of Chinese customers who still cannot afford MacBooks If the rumors are true InventecXiaomi will allegedly use the energyefficient W Scenario Design Power Atom xZ SoC The Atom x is a tray <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processor that is already found inside the fanless but powerful Microsoft Surface tabletnotebook Creative professionals already proved that an Atom x could run CPURAMheavy software like Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC The GeekBench chart below already revealed that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom xZ excels on Windows and Android a derivative of Linux platforms Its safe to presume that it will also have exemplary CPU benchmark scores on a Xiaomi Linux laptop The potential economic benefits from Xiaomi selling a cheaper clone of the Macbook Air is easy to comprehend I opine that Xiaomi will not cannibalize the sales of the original bigticket Apple MacBook products Instead it will only create an opportunity to monetize the budgetconstrained Apple fans that cannot afford the real thing The bigger benefits will come once Xiaomi starts selling higherend versions with more expensive Core M or Core i processors inside its laptops The continuing refusal of Apple to sell touchscreenequipped MacBooks might be an exploitable blunder Xiaomi can create a stillcheaper clone of the MacBook Air and make it really appealing by giving it a touchscreen display In spite of the fact that Mac OS X Yosemite already supports touchscreen displays Apple has yet to release a touchscreenequipped Mac computer Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM an early investor in Xiaomi still enjoys great benefits from Xiaomis success as a vendor of iPhonelike Android phones Xiaomi uses Snapdragons and MediaTek processors for its smartphones On the other hand Inventecs confirmation of a laptop from Xiaomi should give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>an opportunity to ride on that Chinese companys ambitious expansion plans Like I said before Xiaomi can get away with copycat designs of luxury Apple products Xiaomi will find millions of eager buyers for them I wont be surprised if Xiaomi suddenly joins rises as one of the top notebook PC vendors by end of Xiaomi is now a global brand that sells affordable but very highquality products It makes up for its razonthin margins by preinstalling its own app store and premium subscription only services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>therefore has a future tailwind in Xiaomis diversification as a PC vendor Xiaomis future support of x processors fortifies my position that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a BuyandHoldForever bet for valueminded investors The Discounted Cash Flowheavy analysis of XFin also still gives a positive longterm valuation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>even at a mere initial annual revenue growth rate calculation We only use your contact details to reply to your
