generate nearly billion in revenue Apple NASDAQ AAPL is expected to sell about million Apple Watches for the September quarter If it does this will represent a huge victory for the company Apple will have established that it really can successfully enter new hardware categories Within the span of a single quarter Apple has established not merely a new product but almost a new industry with unit sales more than half of total Swiss watch production for the quarter In the process Swiss watch exports declined by and even more in the price range of a typical Apple Watch Apple is no longer merely a competitor for single companies but for entire industries The estimate of million Apple Watches sold in Apples fiscal Q comes via Philip ElmerDeWitt and represents a rough median of his poll of analysts This is almost double what I estimate Apple sold in the June quarter million units At an assumed ASP this will add another million to Apples top line compared to last quarter In the same quarter Swiss watch exports declined yy about to million units according to data supplied by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry Although the unit decline was not large about most of the decline was in the critical price category of Swiss Francs right where the Apple Watch ASP sits This can be seen in a chart for the month of September provided by the Federation Geographically the declines in Swiss watch exports have been most pronounced where Apple is very strong In September exports to the US were down yy exports to China were down and exports to Hong Kong were down The advantage of Apple Watch has been that it simply provides much more functionality than conventional mediumpriced watches In addition to being an extremely accurate timepiece the Apple Watch can remind you of appointments and show upcoming events on the users personal calendar Combined with all the other features the watch provides its an unbeatable value The superior value proposition of Apple Watch will continue to erode other advantages of style and status that expensive mechanical watches mainly Swiss have hitherto enjoyed Yes the Apple Watch is kind of chubby and it will never have the cache of a Rolex So what The Apple Watch has gone for the sweet spot and the entire industry not just the Swiss are going to be bleeding profusely as a result This isnt just about the Swiss As this report on global watch production makes clear watches are a huge business In the top exporting countries produced a total of billion watches of which about million were electronic Smartwatches have made the electronic watch obsolete I believe that most electronic watches will be smartwatches in a few years So the total addressable market for smartwatches is about million per year including the upper end of the ewatch market and the lower end of the mechanical watch market Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android Wear smartwatches may get more of this simply by virtue of the larger installed base of Android phones over a billion Apples available watch compatible base can be estimated as follows Apple has shipped a total of million iPhones as of the June quarter Of these about million are iPhone or newer generations that can run the newest iOS and be paired with Apple Watch Assuming an attrition rate of for these newer iPhones this leaves Apple with million available customers for Apple Watch So Apple could go on selling Apple Watch at the rate of million a quarter effectively forever Except that I expect Watch sales to accelerate Since the early sales in the June quarter Apple has been accelerating the availability of Apple Watch first to its own stores and then to large retailers such as Best Buy Putting the Apple Watch on display in retail stores has been critical to building the audience for Apple Watch The watch was just a little too expensive for most to buy exclusively online as Apple required at launch Most importantly the Apple Watch is only going to get better with each succeeding generation Following Apples usual practice succeeding generations will be sleeker be able to do more and have better battery life As Apple adds value to the device I expect sales to increase Even as Android takes most of the unit sales of smartwatches I expect Apple to take most of the profit as it does now with smartphones The reason for this will be as it is for smartphones Apple Watches will all contain Apples own custom designed processors just as iPhone does These processors will have superior capability to any commodity smartwatch processor especially from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC The Apple watchOS will provide superior integration with the rest of the iOS ecosystem and the abundance of apps will also be an edge Combined with Apples design flair and obsession with quality Apple Watch will be a smartwatch apart from the rest of the commodity Android Wear watches and will continue to command a premium price Apple reportedly had early production problems that limited the gross margin of the watch These problems have apparently been resolved judging by the wide availability of the watch Therefore I expect Apple Watch gross margin to converge to Apples corporate average of about for the September quarter At sales of million units thats million in gross profit from this new product line Apple Watch sales alone could add million in operating profit using Apples typical operating margin of about These are excellent results for a brand new product category We only use your contact
