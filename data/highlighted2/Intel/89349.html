same Cherry Trail Atom processor used by the Asus Pen Stick Asus unveiled its Atom Cherry Trailpowered Pen Stick product earlier this month The Asus Pen Stick is the worlds first Windows computeronastick product The worlds biggest PC vendor Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY joins Asustek OTC ASUUY as major backers of Intels NASDAQ INTC Compute Stick product concept The Bluetooth Special Interest Groups website confirmed that Lenovo has a PC stick product This is a very important development that helps legitimize the HDMI stick form factor as a mainstream consumercentric computer Brad Linder of Liliputing speculated that the Lenovo IdeaCentre Stick will also use the same older generation Bay Trail Atom Z processor However judging from Asusteks own Pen Stick product I am inclined to believe that Lenovos upcoming PC stick will also come with the new Cherry Trail Atom X processor The Asus Pen Stick is the worlds first Windows PConastick product and it is scheduled for commercial release on Q There is no official technical specs released yet but the competitive nature of Lenovo that helped it become the worlds top seller of desktop computers says it is highly likely that Lenovo will also create a PC Stick product that is on par with the Asus Pen Sticks hardware specs Using the latest Cherry Trail processor will help Lenovo come up with a fanless PC Stick The original <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Compute Stick has a small fan inside it because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>likely found out that the Atom Z processor needed it for better heat dissipation Furthermore Lenovo will want an Atom X processor because it has better GPU performance and wireless charging features Tiny PC Sticks should not be used for heavy heatgenerating D PC gaming However the Gen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD graphics of Cherry Trail Atom XX processors support OpenCL acceleration which is also important for Photoshop and other Windowsspecific productivity software users Lenovo will have to release a Cherry Trailpowered fanless version of its IdeaCentre Stick product if it wants to attract the interest of highlymobile creative professionals The alleged price tag of the Atom Xequipped Asus Pen Stick computer product is also believable A quick check on Intels website revealed that Cherry Trail processors could be bought for as low as tray While this years PC stick products will be limited to cheap Cherry Trail processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>intends to put Core M processors inside Compute Stick products next year Core M products are priced far higher than Cherry Trail Atom processors Intels plan for Compute Stick for next year is therefore a desirable move for all INTC investors A Core Mpowered Compute Stick codenamed Cedar City from Lenovo or Asustek could be a hit among demanding consumersenterprise users CPUintensive industry standard software like Photoshop certainly benefits from the more robust compute capabilities of a Core M processor Another important improvement for the nextgen Compute Stick is the inclusion of MHL support The current HDMI Compute Stick products available today still use a microUSB portcable for power Enabling MHL Mobile HighSpeed Link support means the next PC Stick products will draw power directly from the HDTV port of a TV or a desktop monitor The new superMHL standard is capable of charging mobile devices up to W and also has support for USB TypeC connection INTC is a Buy The Compute Stick concept can no longer be dismissed as a niche product Lenovo and Asusteks support makes it mainstream merchandise for the global market Lenovo and Asustek sold almost million computers last Q Lenovo and Asus clearly have the production capacity and global distribution channels to easily market million Compute Sticks per month The Lenovo and Asus global brands are also certainly more popular and more trustworthy than MeeGoPad or Mouse Computer mStick Success breeds envy HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ Dell and Acer OTCASIYF might also come up with their own versions of the Compute Stick once Lenovo and Asus start getting decent sales from their PC Stick products Dell already has an Android PC Stick product for enterprise users However the upcoming release of Windows might inspire Dell to create a Windows
