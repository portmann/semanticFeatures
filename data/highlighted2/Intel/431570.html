Polaris GPUs Will Get Inside New Macs Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD is selling its first nanometer and virtual realityready Polaris GPU for just Reasonable pricing will help AMD retain the Mac business Nvidias cheapest Pascal GPU for now is the GTX The revenue from supplying Radeon GPUs to Apple is important to AMD AMD has longterm benefits from Apple having a strong growing Mac business I firmly believe that Polaris GPUs of Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD are likely to get inside the next generation of Apple NASDAQ AAPL computers AMDs decision to sell its first nanometer Polaris GPU for just dimmed the chances of Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA winning back some Mac business this year Consequently Apples upcoming GPU needs could help push AMDs stock even higher this year Apple choosing the Polaris GPU will help AMD improve its campaign against Nvidia Yes AMD has been retaking market share in GPUs from Nvidia over the last few months However as of Q Nvidia still enjoys a wide lead in desktop and mobile GPUs Apples ability to sell million Macs every quarter can boost sales of Polaris GPUs The rumor that Apple will use Polaris GPUs started in April Fudzilla again claimed four days ago that its sources revealed AMDs Polaris GPUs will be used inside the versions of the iMac and MacBook This lingering gossip is fortified by the fact that Apple has indeed recently been favoring AMD over Nvidia The most expensive current models of Macs are now using discrete GPUs made by AMD With the circumstantialreal evidences mentioned above I conclude that Nvidia is not getting any discrete Pascal GPU purchase orders for Apple computers this year The cheapest Pascal GPU the GTX which will retail for is endangered by AMDs lowballing Radeon RX As far as I know other than Apple there is no other top PC manufacturer that heavily favors Radeon GPUs Losing the Mac business could really hurt AMD On the other hand the economic benefit from Apple choosing Polaris over Nvidias Pascal is pretty obvious AAPLs money can help AMD complete its turnaround story Getting to million discrete GPU orders from Apple will help AMD pay interest on or even reduce its billion longterm debt We cannot deny that AMD still carries some of the debt burden that it incurred when it bought ATIRadeon nine years ago The more PC vendors that buy Radeon GPUs the better it is for AMDs future I cannot exactly say that Apple will buy Polaris GPUs at an average price of But if we guesstimate that Apple will pay an average price of and then multiply it by million units AMD can possibly gain millionyear Consistently getting million every year from Apple is an important tailwind for AMD My millionyear guesstimate could even go higher AMDs investors should take note that unlike the stagnating iPhone business the Mac division is a growing contributor to Apples top line From just contributing in Q Mac revenue accounted for of Apples revenue in Q Consequently theres the strong probability that the growing annual sales of Mac computers will continue Stronger Mac sales benefits AMD AMDs more affordable Polaris GPUs will help Apple sell more pricey laptops and desktop computers There are still people who look down on Intels NASDAQ INTC integrated GPUs As a Mac user since I know Apple likes selling computers that are more expensive than its equivalent Windows counterparts Consequently getting a cheaper AMD video card rather than an Nvidia one helps improve the gross margins on Mac computers I also think that Nvidia is not in any mood to match AMDs low pricing for Polaris GPUs just to win some deals from Apple Nvidias balance sheet is so healthy that it can easily shrug off Apple snubbing its GPUs I say this because Nvidias GPU products are no longer limited to consumer PCs Nvidias GPUs are now at the forefront of deeplearning computers AMD and Apple have a symbiotic relationship Apple favoring Radeon GPUs is helping AMD survive The chart below also explains why discrete or standalone Radeon GPUs are important to the Mac Intels recent integrated GPU solution is still very unsatisfactory to Macbased gamers No decent Macbased gamer will tolerate the fps Diablo III performance of Intels highend Iris Pro <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the best x CPUs but Apple still needs AMD to make its Mac more palatable to gamers For gamers and multimedia editors the cheaper Radeon RX is obviously the better choice over the GTX of Nvidia For less than MacBooks and iMacs could tout virtual reality features and excellent benchmark scores The Radeon RX is already identified as the DFC Polaris GPU which VideoCardzcom discovered as very competitive against the Radeon R Fury The Radeon RX also outperformed the Nvidia GTX Reasonable pricing not benchmark scores is most likely why Apple will keep using AMDmade video cards Nvidias Pascal GPUs might perform better than Polaris GPUs but they will cost more In my long years of using Macs Apple never made the slight differences in gamecentric benchmark scores an important selling point for its computers I rate AMD as a Buy Tim Cook will choose the Polaris GPUs over Nvidia Pascal because they allow Apple to get more money out of every Mac sale The screenshot below should illustrate clearly why Apple will choose Polaris GPUs The first Polaris GPU offers a great valueformoney deal for PC manufacturers and consumers I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no
