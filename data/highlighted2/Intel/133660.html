style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron have announced D XPoint memory with new materials and new D XPoint technology In the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel

produce a wafer that has processor and memory Now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU have announced a new storage class memory with D XPoint memory a next step is likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will take the new materials and D XPoint technology and apply it to their processors When the new materials and D XPoint technology are applied to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors the processor and memorystorage can be further integrated at the silicon level producing extremely small powerful low power and lower cost devices with the processor and allneeded memory and storage on one silicon This quantum leap in linking processors and more memorystorage integrating processor and memorystorage in D on silicon could send <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock soaring as this new silicon would dramatically speed up computing in data centers and increase powerful processing in smaller lower power use and lower cost mobile and IoT devices New frontiers in computing would be opened with full computers being almost invisible to the human eye In the past new materials manufacturing and technology have often been explored and applied first to memory and then applied to processors In when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was first formed it was primarily a memory maker During the s and s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>applied what they learned from making memory to making processors and left the business of producing memory However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>kept developing memory technology and in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron formed a joint venture to develop new nonvolatile memory Intels focus was on cutting edge memory technology while Micron took the lead in producing the memory An example of materials being first developed for memory and then applied to processors is hafnium which was first developed and tested for memory during the s and then later used in processors in Now IntelMicron have announced new materials and new D XPoint technology for memory While the details of the new materials and technology were not provided these new proprietary innovations will have far reaching impacts on the entire semiconductor sector In the announcement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also has said they will develop new products using this technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely also develop fabs to produce this new memory independent of Micron in order to meet the huge demand thats likely to develop These new materials and D XPoint technology will likely be applied to processors to increase the density reduce the power use and increase the speed of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors These new materials and D technology will likely help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>achieve greater density faster speed lower energy use and lower cost in processors and continue Moores law in D <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has once again shown its ability to innovate new materials and new technology First in memory to be followed by similar materials and D XPoint innovations in processors and then in integration of memorystorage and processor at the silicon level so that one barely visible piece of silicon will function as a complete computer with processing memory storage and communication absorbing energy to run from its surroundings For more about energy harvesting see the presentation by WenHann Wang Vice President Managing Director <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
