in the first half of the year the longterm growth story still has legs The earnings results were roughly inline however the financial outlook indicates that Q earnings will beat analyst estimates While the fullyear outlook wasnt exactly bad it wasnt phenomenal either With flat revenue and growth primarily propped up by the DCG investors should anticipate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC to stage a robust recovery toward the middle of CY Th outlook was a blowout this quarter which is why the stock moved significantly higher in the after hours session <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be undervalued and with a competitive product stack starting to emerge in both mobile and storage solutions theres decent suspicion that topline growth is within the cards over the foreseeable three years Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also retains an edge when it comes to chip designs and is likely to build upon that with both nm technology and new chip designs in the foreseeable twoyears Earlier in Q management indicated that both earnings and sales were likely to disappoint which is what contributed to the early year sell off Admittedly sellside analysts remained relatively optimistic with most reiterating their earlier stance with the exception of JMP Securities Analyst Alex Gauna Also Cody Acree from Ascendiant remains bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>so owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt come without some healthy dose of skepticism from some reputed analysts I think theres enough infant business opportunities to drive growth in both top line and bottom line over the long run Therefore I believe theres a good risk to reward for investing into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at current levels What was nice about Intels earnings report was the growth in bottom line results which was primarily driven by the reduction in tax rate and incremental increases in its OpEx structure Sales remained flat for the fiscal year driven by better than expected server sales The EPS figure met consensus expectations so both the top line and bottom line were basically inline with expectations After plugging the outlook values provided by Intels management into my spreadsheet I anticipate revenue of billion gross margin beat of around basis points and operating expenses to come inline with the outlook The tax rate is particularly low in the upcoming fiscal quarter and will trend higher in the second half of the fiscal year The effective tax rate is expected to be and will jump back to for the second half of the fiscal year I anticipate share buybacks to slow down perhaps million in free cash flow will go toward buybacks These assertions could change following the annual stock holders meeting The lower tax rate and production ramp will drive better yields improving gross margins These two factors drive my assertions of a beat on EPS for the upcoming fiscal quarter The consensus EPS estimate for Q FY is My EPS estimate is which indicates that Intels outlook beat consensus analyst earnings estimates for the second quarter by However a more conservative scenario on gross margins may eventually play out as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is winding down capacity in older fabs and is putting the added capacity toward nm and nm This puts some pressure on gross margins which may indicate that my gross margin assertion could be a little aggressive So if I operate on a gross margin figure instead of the slightly more aggressive gross margin figure earnings per share will come in at which is still a major beat on consensus estimates for the next quarter Admittedly the revenue outlook wasnt as good but going into the next FY I anticipate sales to stabilize in PCCG and growth in various businesses data center storage mobile and embedded systems to drive top line While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could have started the year better in traditional desktop and laptop computers Im fairly confident that an upgrade cycle could offer some stability in the holiday quarter Furthermore PC orders and demand could shift in the latter half of the year as managements foresight into the supply chain will most likely change three months prior to the beginning of the holiday quarter Theres the potential the launch of a new operating system paired with faster computing components will impact demand toward the end of the year Overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems extremely undervalued at times earnings The dividend yield also sweetens the deal Therefore I reiterate my buy recommendation as the stock could easily outperform the returns of the SP toward the second half of the year Source Intels Financial Outlook Indicates Q Will Beat Expectations Disclosure The author has no positions in
