she could possibly realistically do about it nothing Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported results that were shocking in many ways though not necessarily unexpectedly so Last quarter CEO Tim Cook had warned that the business had shifted On a conference call with analysts in January he declared The challenging global macroeconomic environment is leading to constrained conditions unlike anything weve seen everywhere we look In that quarter Q fiscal Q Apple did manage to beat its record revenue so the drop in revenue in this next quarter only further suggests the macroeconomic environment is leading to constrained conditions And unlike Janet Yellen Apple isnt ready to forecast that to change soon though as always they see the longer term remaining ever so bright The revenue forecast for Q Apples fiscal Q was equally dismal with expectations of just to billion vs the billion level that analysts had already downgraded to In trying to explain its worst quarter since Cook again turned to the economy Chief executive Tim Cook partially blamed strong macroeconomic headwinds including the strong US dollar for the decline in sales which was particularly severe in China On yesterdays conference call he specifically stated it as the reason for weakness in the smartphone business where sales of Apples iPhone fell for the first time ever I think that the market as you know is currently not growing however my view of that is thats an overhang of the macroeconomic environment and were optimistic this too shall pass and the market and particularly us will grow again The FOMCs April policy statement was amended to include what is increasingly just reality that the economy appears to have slowed We will find out tomorrow just how much that might have been when the advance estimate for GDP is released though we can reasonably infer from the language here if not Apples sudden plight that it isnt likely to be appreciably better than all the advance guesses even including residual seasonality yet again Last October there wasnt even the hint of such a dramatic reversal for Apple In its press release Tim Cook was quoted with only glowing assessments for the end of the year and the allimportant Christmas season Fiscal was Apples most successful year ever with revenue growing to nearly billion This continued success is the result of our commitment to making the best most innovative products on earth and its a testament to the tremendous execution by our teams We are heading into the holidays with our strongest product lineup yet including iPhone s and iPhone s Plus Apple Watch with an expanded lineup of cases and bands the new iPad Pro and the allnew Apple TV which begins shipping this week The quarter prior to that reported in July Cook had left no doubt over continued enthusiasm even about Apple sales and revenue potential in China We remain extremely bullish on China and were continuing to invest Nothing thats happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apples largest market at some point in the future Sales in greater China including Hong Kong and Taiwan instead in Q again Apples Q fell an alarming For the Chinese mainland alone revenues were down With revenues being forecast so low in Q we can only assume that conditions in China as everywhere else are not expected to rebound immediately suggesting only lingering macroeconomic constraints The company may project that there will be a turnaround even still this year but they like economists always predict that As IBM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and other tech companies these are important bellwether notices that something has changed since the middle of last year Unlike the major employment statistics these are hard figures that are not subject to biased imputations In the FOMC statement for April the Committee did acknowledge that slowing in the economy but also referred yet again to their view that labor conditions improved further Labor conditions have yet to do anything but improve only further proving just how irrelevant they have been and will likely continue to be Apples drastically awful results once again show that depending upon the BLS statistics for basing expectations on why the economy wont or even cant get worse is just folly No matter what the unemployment rate had declared or every orthodox economic assessment about how China is just undergoing a soft landing there is every reason to believe that is not the case We see it in far too many economic statistics already but when it gets into Apples results in such a big way we can only be assured as to which economy is the real one Even where that might seem to be more of an overseas problem at least when it is admitted in the mainstream it should be noted that Apples USbased revenue fell last quarter and overall revenue in the Americas segment the bulk of which is US sales was down in the last six months That decline was actually worse than the drop in sales reported from Greater China over those same two quarters The economy isnt just slowing overseas it is everywhere from Apple revenue both foreign and domestic to even DC monetary
