Young Investors Next Steps Coming Full Circle Seeking Alpha My last article which outlined the balancing of my portfolio as well as the new investments made explained the short term outcome of said investments This article will continue on that timeline including what has occurred as well as outline the new investments purchased with those profits and cash These investments show my goals coming to fruition by way of profits from growth stocks providing capital for dividend paying holdings I also throw in a bonus of knowing my portfolio yield to help evaluate my efforts and direction the portfolio is headed In my previous article about my next steps with my young investor portfolio I discussed what investment decisions I made to that point in time These decisions were outlined with a reason and their short term result explained Some of these results were great as in the case of my GoPro NASDAQ GPRO investment while others such as Prospect Capital NASDAQ PSEC and Seadrill Limited NYSE SDRL proved to be more of a battle with deeper homework and reevaluation needed Within that article I presented my investment decisions with the proceeds I had received from selling my Johnson Controls NYSE JCI holdings in order to balance out my portfolio I also decided to jump ahead a little in that article and explain where those investments had gone You can read how they faired in more detail there and match up to what I will discuss here Since those investments in GoPro Prospect Capital and Seadrill I have used proceeds from profits specifically GoPro to invest in dividend paying stocks while other cash and dividends went towards purchasing more of these names With that said lets take a quick look at the table I had setup at the close of my last article This serves as a refresher on where we last stood in my portfolio Keep in mind these are with prices of these stocks over a year ago and without any of the dollar cost averaging or profit taking I mentioned in the last article since I had jumped ahead to explain the impact of those investments Since a few things happened with my Seadrill Prospect Capital and GoPro holdings in that time frame I will update the holding percentages to reflect new stock prices and any follow on purchases I had made such as SDRL and PSEC So what specifically happened between the two tables First Seadrill began a drop in stock price that I decided to dollar cost average down along with You can look up my reasoning in the first part of this series This decision kept my percentage steady as it only wavered a half of a percent and created a lower cost basis per share Second with Prospect Capital I decided after only adding more to the original holding via dividends to stop further investment The decline in percentage reflects the decline in stock price Finally GoPro had rocketed up from its IPO to where I took profits at the high end of its early upswing I netted over in profits during this time and regained my capital outlay plus more I again after several months had cash to invest with But what to invest in now Well according to my goals it should be invested directly into dividend paying stocks Turns out thats just what I did Pepsi had been a long time wish list stock that I have been waiting to own With cash available I decided to put it into the company after reviewing its stock price and subsequent value Price and value are important because it is the value investing ideology to look for the right price compared to metrics What was equally important to me and what made me strongly consider PEP is its dividend history PepsiCo has years of dividend growth history As far as Im concerned any dividend growth that has gone on longer than Ive been alive is a stock worth looking at Additionally its payout ratio of is modest enough for the security of its dividend and continued streak of increases Another reason for picking Pepsi is that I wanted to continue to diversify my portfolio While I already own a consumer goods company in Proctor and Gamble I felt like PepsiCo was more concentrated on the beverage and snack industry than PG because PG deals more with cleaning and personal products like Tide and Braun This is a further diversification within one industry itself and I liked how the portfolio would look with Pepsi filling in another niche I wound up buying Pepsi in the high s and very low s I did it in smaller purchases so as to gain the best average price At this point today Im up on my capital investment and have already received four dividends This will be a very long term holding much like my original core holdings I plan to add more to my Pepsi holding as cash and valuation allows Surprise surprise I have another technology stock to add to the portfolio This time its the very well known chip maker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>This pick kills two birds with one stone Going back to my original thesis on my goals I explained that I like to choose industries and companies within those industries that I am familiar with Of course technology hardware and semiconductors all fall within that familiarity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is slightly different than other dividend paying companies that I can choose from in that it is going through an interesting phase in the computer world Since PCs are on a decline in the industry and much of Intels income comes from that it puts the company in an interesting situation Should the PC market rally and they continue the course the decline should right itself On the other hand should the decline in the PC market continue but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>puts more behind its higher growth division like servers or push harder with cloud services it could make itself more relevant to todays market Intels dividend history is weaker than PepsiCos but it has a higher yield mostly due to the retreat in price from its week high but it is the leader in its industry and has held tough through the weak times in the economy by still issuing a dividend I also believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will remain relevant in chip making regardless of the PC market All of this to say that Ive only taken a very small stake in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>thus far by allocating only a fraction of what I did for Pepsi Should the time arise where I have cash and find the valuation very compelling as it is now then I will put more towards this holding Now that Ive discussed my latest additions allow me to show you the latest table of my holdings that is accurate to January th of this year Its About The Dividends After All Right I figured while I was writing this article I would add some more color to my portfolio for my readers Since the idea here is to build on my dividend income positions either through new companies or reinvesting further into current ones I think a portfolio dividend yield calculation would be appropriate Since I had never done this exercise before I was quite curious what I had to show for my research and time building the portfolio I was happy to find out that my portfolio yields I feel like this is a respectable yield for a portfolio that wishes to find income through dividends especially one that has been tweaked a lot and contains of the assets invested in high growth names As a reader of mine I ask you What do you think is an appropriate yield considering my goals my youth and my ways of going about growing my portfolio I am happy that I have been able to make the first full circle connection with my stated goals by investing in growth names taking profits when appropriate and redistributing those profits into strong dividend paying names I feel I have been establishing a good pattern by following through on this I plan on repeating what has worked for me and continue to grow the portfolio not only in yield but in capital appreciation as well Source The Young Investors Next Steps Coming Full Circle Disclosure I amwe are long FBGPROHLTJCIMRKPEGPEPPGPRCPPSECSDRLWMT INTC MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my
