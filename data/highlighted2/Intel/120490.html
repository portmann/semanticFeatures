Should the time arise where I have cash and find the valuation very compelling, as it is now, then I will put more towards this holding.Now that I've discussed my latest additions allow me to show you the latest table of my holdings that is accurate to January 30th of this year.It's About The Dividends After All, Right?I figured while I was writing this article I would add some more color to my portfolio for my readers.Since the idea here is to build on my dividend income positions - either through new companies or reinvesting further into current ones - I think a portfolio dividend yield calculation would be appropriate.Since I had never done this exercise before I was quite curious what I had to show for my research and time building the portfolio.I was happy to find out that my portfolio yields: 3.01% I feel like this is a respectable yield for a portfolio that wishes to find income through dividends especially one that has been tweaked a lot and contains 14% of the assets invested in high growth names.As a reader of mine I ask you: What do you think is an appropriate yield considering my goals, my youth, and my ways of going about growing my portfolio?I am happy that I have been able to make the first full circle connection with my stated goals by investing in growth names, taking profits when appropriate, and redistributing those profits into strong dividend paying names.I feel I have been establishing a good pattern by following through on this.I plan on repeating what has worked for me and continue to grow the portfolio not only in yield but in capital appreciation as well.Source: The Young Investor's Next Steps: Coming Full Circle Disclosure: I am/we are long FB,GPRO,HLT,JCI,MRK,PEG,PEP,PG,PRCP,PSEC,SDRL,WMT, INTC.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
