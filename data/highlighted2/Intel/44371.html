gained market share compared to the December quarter while Apple lost share In this article I look at the question of whether this change in market share is significant for the long term It came as a surprise to almost no one when IDC reported that Samsung OTCSSNLF had regained the lead in global smartphone sales in the March quarter Apples NASDAQ AAPL decline in smartphone market share relative to Samsung may not be as important as assumed however Other factors such as mobile device profitability and investments in product development may play a greater role in determining the outlook for these two companies It has become commonplace to question IDCs accuracy and impartiality in reporting Apple sales but Ive chosen not to go there Such shoot the messenger exercises are unproductive And when IDC reported a virtual tie between Apple and Samsung in smartphone sales for the December quarter I was more than happy to celebrate the news I also did a little dancing on Samsungs smartphone grave which may have been premature As of the December quarter results I declared victory for Apple in the smartphone war with Samsung Samsung came back in the March quarter with sales and market share increases in its smartphone business But these were quarter over quarter increases rather than year over year I still believe Apple will ultimately triumph but thats a little hard to prove at this juncture So lets take a closer look at the market share results and do some comparison of quarterly results in order to put IDCs information in perspective As I usually do I massage the IDC data a little to generate a top five vendor market share number rather than the total market share calculation that IDC uses This is one of the ways that my thinking about market share has evolved over the past year IDC and other research firms naturally count all Android devices sales usually lumped into an other category even though many of those sales include socalled white box sales in China and other emerging markets Many including myself question whether those white box phones should even be included in the smartphone category By recalculating market share to include only IDCs identified top five smartphone makers I effectively exclude white box sales The trends in market share are shown in the chart below Note that some of the lines are discontinuous because the membership of the top five vendors changes from quarter to quarter For instance Xiaomi didnt make it into the top five in Q There are a couple of important takeaways from this chart First even though Samsung posted a sequential share increase this quarter and Apple a sequential decline Samsungs market share declined yy from to Meanwhile Apples top five share rose from to In terms of absolute shipments Samsungs actually declined yy by while Apples rose by In the chart below I show yy unit shipment changes Note that Lenovos yy growth for Q was partially fueled by the Motorola acquisition Its not clear what Lenovos growth would have been without Motorola Many point to the greater profitability of Apples iPhone business as proof that market share doesnt matter Theres no question that Apple is still winning the smartphone profit battle but its hard to tell exactly by how much because neither company reports a clean definitive smartphone operating profit Apple doesnt break down operating profit by product line at all and Samsung only reports operating profit for the IT and Mobile segment which includes all their telecom and Internet related equipment sales including feature phone handsets Based on Apple and Samsungs earnings reports for the March quarter Ive estimated operating income and margin for each companys mobile device business For the case of Samsung that business includes feature phones as theres no way to separate the smartphone component Even though Apple makes more profit from its phones it isnt absolutely clear that it confers a competitive advantage It probably does but there are some headwinds For Apple the main problem is how to spend the money it makes Much of it is offshore and is simply accumulating in Apples cash pile Apple has had difficulty finding ways to put that cash to use to compete more effectively so it piles up quarter after quarter As of the March quarter cash shortterm securities and longterm securities equaled billion No wonder the EU is chomping at the bit to slap Apple with a bill for back taxes Samsung isnt making nearly as much money from its handset business But Samsung is a very diversified electronics manufacturer capable of shifting resources around in order to make significant investments for its mobile device business One of the most important investments Samsung has made is in the area of its foundry business Samsung invested heavily in its nm FinFET process and is the first manufacturer to be in mass production of FinFET ICs outside of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC This is a huge achievement and Samsung has been able to use the process to confer a speed advantage for its Galaxy S smartphone The S uses Samsungs Exynos processor which Chipworks has verified is built using Samsungs nm FinFET Some have questioned whether this is a true nm process including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management Once again this isnt really productive for our purposes Samsungs process is still a considerable advance over the best that has been available in the ARM foundry world up until now Samsungs use of its own chip has made the S the fastest Android phone available while maintaining reasonable battery life By most tests its also faster than the iPhone as well although not by much My point here is that Samsung has a fairly straightforward way to deploy its capital to gain advantage in smartphones whereas its more difficult for Apple Samsung started shipping the S toward the end of the quarter so its not clear how much of an impact it had to Samsungs results and market share The jury is definitely out as to the future market impact of the S I believe Apple investors should brace themselves for some nearterm impact especially in the June quarter as we see the first full quarter of S sales while iPhone sales taper off in anticipation of the next iPhone There will be plenty of pundits ready to declare the S the victor in the smartphone wars based on next quarters results The key takeaway for Apple investors is that shortterm fluctuations in unit sales and market share are not as important as the longterm trend Whats important is whether Apples iPhone business is growing faster than the overall smartphone market In general if iPhone grows market share then it also grows faster than the market This is what I look for in the market share numbers In the face of the challenge of the S the longterm trend is debatable and Apple bears and bull can reasonably disagree over this point Heres how I think the race will play out in the next few quarters In June Apple will preview its next release of iOS at WWDC This will serve to spur interest and anticipation for the next generation of iOS devices When Apple releases the next gen devices these will almost certainly feature the more advanced Samsung nm FinFET process at least initially Its thought that TSMC will get about of the business but I expect this to occur later in the year as TSMC NYSE TSM ramps up production of their own nm FinFET process Thus Apple will have closed the process gap with the S and will feature its new version of iOS Since Apple designs its own cpu cores on its systems on chip SOCs Apples next generation devices wont just achieve parity with the S but will pull ahead in speed and energy efficiency This will position Apple for another spectacular December quarter Its clear that the two competitors will keep trying to leapfrog each other and with major smartphone introductions by the two staggered about months apart each has a window in which to enjoy a measure of superiority Ultimately I expect Apple to pull ahead of Samsung in sales and market share by virtue of its investments in chip design and operating system but it may take several product cycles for this to become apparent Apple is an investment for those with a longterm outlook Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a
