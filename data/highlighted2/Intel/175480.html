class='textDiv'>Dissecting The Complex Semiconductor Industry Where Is It Heading The Next Years Seeking Alpha This industry has evolved into a vertical specialization model From an industry predominantly of integrated device manufacturers it is now proliferated with various business models At the current stage of semiconductor industry evolution structural changes are imminent ie closures retrenchments mergers and acquisitions joint ventures alliances and business models change Product differentiation via technological innovation and functional value is crucial to thrive Therefore the fabless model will continue to flourish Existing IDMs will become more fablite fabless or go bust Only a few major players will still own fabs and they are likely to be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Samsung <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does have additional lead in cuttingedge technology This article evaluates the complex semiconductor industry from the perspective of the current structure stage of evolution industry forces and macroenvironment factors Based on these insights of this global industry the outlook over the next five years is then predicted The industry involves design and fabrication of semiconductor devices for diversified application markets Moores Law predicts that the industry will double the number of transistors per chip every two years at the same unit cost In contrast cost has grown exponentially in recent years see figure Figure Cost of building a leadingedge semiconductor factory For this reason this industry has been gravitating toward Asia and more importantly it evolved into a vertical specialization model to spread the cost and risks From an industry predominantly of integrated device manufacturers IDM namely fabless manufacturers which design and outsource the manufacturing contract manufacturers commonly known as foundries and backend processes assembly and test services some IDMs also offer foundry service There are companies which specialize in creation licensing and trading of design modules This diverse representation is noted in the top six companies for the first half of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Hynix OTCHXSCF and Micron NASDAQ MU are IDMs Samsung OTCSSNLF a vertically integrated IC supplier TSMC NYSE TSM a pureplay foundry and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM a fabless company The C value is tabulated to be which represents the percent of industry sales taken by the top four companies The HerfindahlHirschman Index HHI another measure of market concentration is in the range of These figures indicated a low market concentration In general it means this industry is not dominated by few players and there are great competition among firms Traditionally the semiconductor industry has a high cost of entry due to substantial capital requirements for new factories upgrades of facilities and RD This has been mitigated with the fabless business model where a company specializes in design and outsources the manufacturing Joint ventures and government support also lowered the barrier Recently China set up a national semiconductor industry investment fund which not only focuses on the fab and IC design companies but also to stimulate industry merger and acquisition activity in and outside of China Larger firms within the industry are another source of financial funding to encourage new entrants For instance Qualcomm committed to invest an aggregate of M into four Chinese companies and the China Walden Venture Investments fund Exit is costly as assets are not easily convertible into a different industry unless through acquisition or licensespatents selloffs Differentiation is possible at a product level via its functional value even with a commoditized product For example a microprocessor unit is differentiated in its platforms or total solutions offered like IBMs NYSE IBM SystemonChip SoC products which integrated its trademarked microprocessors Companies also discern themselves with earnings from an intellectual property portfolio with Qualcomm as the best example for its GG licenses The industry does not have perfect knowledge Although standard information is available in terms of product listing specifications and price most information remains confidential eg actual cost capacity utilization and technology road maps The demand forecast also is unpredictable especially for consumer electronics which have short life cycles and dependent on a broader economic situation Generally the industry shares the same technology and production economics for the factory setup equipments standards and efficiency improvement methodologies If a company owns the IPs over processes and designs similar and better products are still susceptible to replication by competitors via reverse engineering The industry remains prone to price taking with pressure coming from consumers competitors and excess capacity circumstances A thriving semiconductor firm needs to discern itself with a first mover advantage or product differentiation Moreover electronic products commoditize over relatively short life cycles hence only design and software capability can rescue businesses from failing Therefore the number of design companies increase while IDMs decrease Industry profit is still rising based on the global semiconductor sales trend in figure Hence the industry is at a growth stage with symptoms of early maturity as outlined in subsequent paragraphs China became the prime source of industry growth as substantiated by semiconductor consumption trends in figure and figure As extracted from an article Asia Pacific is forecasted to be the fastest growing region with of the total semiconductor market by Growing demand is fueled by technological development in smartphones tablets and the automotive sector Demand growth in was particularly sparked by a drop in supply especially the dynamic random access memory and data flash memory after players left this segment Qimonda Promos and Powerchip left while Micron acquired Elpida and Rexchip In addition some frontend fabs were converted from DRAM to logic flash or other purposes The industry is driven by product and process innovation a characteristic of growth stage The emerging applications market ie renewable energyclean technology Internet of Things G and many more will renew a stage of growing adopters Standardization will occur around dominant technology as what Qualcomm realized for GGLTE development Players drop out from the industry mainly due to consolidation by merger and acquisition MA see figure Rate of new capacity addition also declined as shown in figure At the current stage of evolution this industry has to address these factors in order to stay in the game price delivery quality cost efficiency operational efficiency and effectiveness In this path structural changes are imminent ie closure retrenchment MA JVs alliances and business model changes Technological innovation and functional value to clearly differentiate a product is crucial to win the game The fact is that semiconductor chips are heavily commoditized Hence RD is of utmost priority Again MA and strategic alliances also enable rapid diffusion of knowledge Advancing Moores Law is another means to widen the gap time lapse to replicate from competitors albeit that requires high investment cost to upgrade facilities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has consistently topped other companies in its RD expenditures and this is exactly how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>maintains its dominance in terms of technology nodes No substitutes coupled with an abundance of complements are reasons for the industrys perpetual growth Semiconductors are essential in any end consumer application A boom in any segment ie smart cars ecommercesocial media gaming etc causes leaps and bounds in demand for chips For instance hyperscale technology companies need to build their own data centers such as Facebook NASDAQ FB Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN These data centers are powered by server processors from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>networking chips from Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM and memory from Micron and Sandisk NASDAQ SNDK Rivalry is high within this fragmented market and is the key force in constraining profitability Design houses without the burden of manufacturing have a lower exit barrier exacerbating the threat of competition IDMs and foundries have high exit barriers but obtain high returns during economic boom times Companies struggle to gain a competitive advantage where the key determinant is product differentiation Buyers are pricesensitive and there is low switching costs unless involving proprietary differences customized processesdesigns or specific quality requirements ie in the automotive segment Currently Samsung holds a technological edge over TSMC when it comes to the latest manufacturing process with shrinkage of transistors to nanometers whereas TSMC only begun shipping its nm technology recently Apple NASDAQ AAPL and IBM were having trouble designing chips that could keep up with Apples ambitions for Macs and MacBooks so Apple went with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>What truly distinguish a company effectively is cuttingedge technology The threat of entrants is moderate Brand identity is not important and the high capital requirement is mitigated by a fabless business model alliances private investment and government funding Design houses without the burden of manufacturing can proliferate Theoretically large companies with positive cash flow should still hold some advantage in coping with a price reduction and invest during a downturn to be ready during recovery However this dilutes RD funding to catch up with technological advancement and new market demands Figure clearly showed a diminishing number of large IDMs with shrinkage of the technology node At nm and beyond it is now left with Samsung and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>STMicroelectronics NYSE STM has dropped out from this race of leadingedge technology and is now struggling with its restructuring strategies In contrast the success of economies of scale is exemplified by pureplay foundry TSMC First key force identified is the strong proindustry policy in Asia ie Taiwan China Korea and Singapore For instance China established a new policy in relating to the development of the semiconductor industry with potential financial support up to billion over the next five to ten years The Chinese government also is pushing for stateowned and private enterprises to purchase from local system suppliers Thereby rivalry in the region heightened with the prospect of market growth and opportunities Lowered entrant barriers might displace incumbent global players Global players have to review their strategies to assert their presence in Asia If the US remains dormant in its unattractive tax policies and incentives a shift in region dominance to Asia Pacific is inevitable The second significant force from the social aspect is the rising income of developing countries turning electronics goods more affordable Emerging countries are catching up with technology adoption Their lifestyle changes to a world of connectivity is fueling growth in ownership of mobile devices This force drives the attractiveness of the industry by enlarging the market and profitability Further a customers price sensitivity likely decreases as middle to highincome group increases On the flipside it does increase a buyers bargaining power as these customers become more knowledgeable Again this stresses the importance of product differentiation to entice both new and repeated purchases Third the rapid technology changes entail high RD spending for instance to cope with the rise of big data and Internet of Things This technological factor also plays a vital role in reshaping the industry structure High RD expenses deplete profitability with risky returns Hence the fabless model is more advantageous than larger IDM companies to meet dynamic changes in market needs The entry barrier for the foundry business will widen due to the capital involved for cuttingedge manufacturing capabilities though they also bear higher risk due to the short life cycles of products Successful RD and timetomarket are crucial factors to stay ahead of the competition From the legal aspect IP ownership becomes a stronger determinant to distance potential entrants With the IP protection law in place infringement claims are being used as a form of retaliation It can be observed that the business model of IP licensing is promising and MAs in order to take over IPs become a means of survival The perennial growth rate is unique to this industry and what makes this maturing industry attractive The competitive forces led the semiconductor industry ecosystem to remap its business models where specialization thrives over vertical integration Companies will increase their presence in Asia attributed to the governments active role in developing the industry The future challenge is to stay ahead of new demand in the industry ie emerging applications markets of IoT big data etc This requires capital expenses in RD resources compressed time to market and a variety of new product introduction Therefore the fabless model is in a more favorable position to excel since these companies are able to focus on their value proposition without the high burden of fixed cost But no doubt its a tough battlefield in this dynamic industry driven by innovation and adoption of endusers The top companies are dynamically shifting ranking as MA and strategic alliances become common strategies to rapidly adjust their portfolio especially through IPs knowhow and talent acquisitions Existing IDMs will become more fablite or fabless or go bust Only a few major players will own fabs to gain priority access to modern facilities and they are likely to be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Samsung With the consolidation standing IDMs will gain more market share as rivals turn to them for foundry services as well Although it is noted from macroenvironment analysis that a monopoly or oligopoly is unlikely to happen with active antitrust enforcement Moreover governments are interested in protecting their local semiconductor industry Foundries will remain concentrated with the caveats of high capital and large complex facilities to handle a variety of technological requirements from a diversified customer base Henceforth TSMC has bright prospects due to a higher entry for foundries and its increasing bargaining power as a supplier Surviving companies will be agile in repositioning portfolios in lieu of declining sectors and expanding its investments beyond their core competency For instance MediaTek the MStar OTCMSTZF buy puts it directly into the smart TV business More recently NXPs NASDAQ NXPI acquisition of rival Freescale will add Freescales computing power to NXP security and wireless communication strengths in order to drive IoT More of such ventures will happen over the next years acquisitions investments in innovative startups and IPlicense managements It will not be surprising to see unorthodox downstream integration like Intels past acquisition of McAfee With the changing nature of rivalry this industry will face new challenges in a complex relationship management For instance your supplier becomes your rival and vice versa IP infringement litigation cases will be common as well Another challenge will be the shortage of highly skilled resources to turn around fastchanging demand in this industry To sum up cost leadership is no longer the determinant for success rather it is driven by differentiation of value proposition The fabless model will flourish Here Qualcomm has already established an edge with a strong base setup in China and for owning a huge patent portfolio The flipside is companies must still have the economies of scale to weather volatility since the chip market is dependent on the health of the global economy Indeed it is forecasted in this article that further consolidation of IDMs and foundries will occur Competition based on operational effectiveness alone is mutually destructive leading to wars of attrition that can be arrested only by limiting competition Michael Porter The memory business consolidation enables profit making which will continue to bring revenues to Micron Finally giants like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Samsung and TSMC will continue to thrive Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade
