NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>forecasts midsingle digit sales increase for the same as the prediction Almost all the sales increase will come from Data Center Group DCG Apparently D NAND and D Xpoint are or products Client Computing Group CCG sales may be flat in On Nov th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC held its annual Investor Meeting NYSE IM where it outlined last years results and forecasted next years Overall the new version lots of blue charts looks a lot like the old version with a few exceptions Last year for example wearables who can forget Brian Krzanichs smart bracelet was highlighted while this year not a mention That is probably a good thing since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and wearables do not compute Another missing item actually two items was CFO Stacy Smiths haikus probably a sign of more seriousness after s lackluster year compared to s IM projections Stacy Smith CFO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation Nov th Data Center Group DCG will represent of revenue growth not leaving much for anything else If we reverse engineer the revenue projections for we start with midsingle digit growth over So lets say with revenue being about B X B for That makes the revenue increase B for But according to Stacy Smith DCG revenues will be up midteens from when they will do about B So DCG revenue at B is a B increase out of a B increase for the total company That leaves M for everything else That means Client Computing Group IoT memory NAND and software sales will not being going up much if at all BK says that mobile sales through the third quarter were about M units With one quarter to go it looks very unlikely that sales will match last years M units Of course this is a good thing since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has lost more than B on mobile chips the last few years so fewer sales would result in fewer moneylosing sales incentives aka contrarevenue In the IM presentations I could not find a reference to D NAND D xpoint NAND yes but not the oldfashioned floating gate D NAND although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>claims it is shipping a TB version now Perhaps it is being overshadowed by the D Xpoint and didnt deserve mention But based upon the sales breakdown from No above there does not seem much room for old fashioned D NAND sales in making it a product at the earliest Is D Xpoint realistically a product D Xpoint has garnered a lot of attention since it was announce in July But according to Diane Bryant VP of theData Center Group D Xpoint will be sampling in Not sampling Q or H but just and this after BK stated in the Q conference call Oct that samples would ship this year So the delivery is already slipping which if true probably means highvolume highmargin highprofit commercial shipments will not occur until According to partner Microns CFO Ernie Maddock on Sept th at the Citi Global Technology Conference regarding D Xpoint Were really were pleased to bring the first new memory technology in years to the market were happy to do it with a partner like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>obviously its brand new So in terms of I have been asked a lot of questions today about what do I think about or or and the reality is when youre doing something thats brand new and you have had the first point in the technology curve you dont know a lot of the answers so were pretty happy and clearly understands sort of the uses for the products here in the short term We have to get more experience with the technology figure out what can be done from a cost perspective which in turn drives market penetration or market applicability So this will be a story to unfold But I can foresee in two or three years that representing a reasonably significant amount of our bit output if things go the way we might expect Increasing capex to B in will cut down on free cash flow In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cut capex to about B and for is estimating billion so free cash flow could be affected significantly This also may effect stock buybacks which in the last four quarters has only reduced the share count by even with the reduced capex I have been critical of CEO Brian Krzanich many times including this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Time For Some New Management and Im not alone Motley Fool had a piece on Krzanich and so did Fortune Basically my argument against BK is lack of profit progress There is always lots of talk about future profits but nothing happens This chart is one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management throws out there every year to show what a great job they are doing I dont question Intels technical prowess they are very good maybe the best But as an investor I want to know when that prowess turns into bottom line profits Until it does this chart is meaningless Who cares about a year node lead when your profits look like the following table This is not a history that inspires either confidence or a huge PE I have written articles about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since last February each one cautioning investors about investing before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shows some bottom line progress So far I have been right with Intels price about the same as months ago For the concensus analysts profit projection is about which looks a lot like the last five years I dont see anything in the investor meeting presentations that would make me believe it will be any different So until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shows some real progress ie significantly improved profits I rate them a hold We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact
