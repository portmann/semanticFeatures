at Microsoft admits that Microsoft is working on a smartphone that must be the spiritual smartphone counterpart of the Surface tablet lineup Eldar Murtazin claims that the Lumia will be stopped and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoCs will be adopted in place of ARM Qualcomm chips in its devices A possible highend lineup based on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel

footprints If it will be able to gain high market share from the future Surface Phone it will be good news for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft That Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ MSFT is working on deeply changing its mobile environment is not a secret During the last quarter Microsoft managed to ship only M Windows Phone units achieving a nearly nonexistent market share The Windows mobile has various issues that affect its market performance but most of all the apps availability and their quality level which is fast improving recently At the same time there is no wow factor able to drive the sales apart from Continuum which is a very interesting feature but still too limited due to the low availability of universal applications However it is clear that Microsoft is working on something new that could be able to change its destiny in the mobile market which is the Surface Phone or something similar MSDN document shows that a Windows Mobile x is a work in progress Daniel Rubino could affirm that Microsoft is working on a Surface Phone Glimpsed Surface Minis and other prototype phones at Building Kevin Gallo stated that Microsoft is considering making Continuum Win compatible which means that it is working on it and evaluating the achievable performances <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working on lower TDPs with Core M The Lumia team is flowing into Surface team Just from here it is easy to think about a new Microsoft phone generation that will be in line with the Surface lineup In an interview on GeekWire Chris Capossela Chief Marketing Officer at Microsoft stated that Windows Phone needs a spiritual equivalent to the Surface lineup We need some sort of spiritual equivalent on the phone side that doesnt just feel like its a phone for people who love Windows Its got to be a phone where its like Wow thats a real shock or thats a real breakthrough and thats going to make me pause before I buy my th iPhone And we need time to actually go build that First of all the Surface Phone or the upcoming phones that are designed by the Surface team will be consistent with the Surface tablet design We will likely see a magnesium or aluminum chassis a sturdy construction and a premium craftsmanship At the same time the new Windows Phone will have to implement new integrated features to trigger the wow effect and make people think that the Windows Phones will not be for Windows fans only it is already known that the Redstone update and further minor updates will bring various features like a contextual Cortana a sort of Now on Tap Microsoft Edge extensions a highly enhanced OneCore and Continuitylike features The enhanced OneCore may come with an enhanced Continuum able to run X applications while it is very unlikely that Continuum will be able to run x traditional applications out of the box it is quite possible that it will exploit the Project Centennial bridge This bridge will permit to adapt traditional apps Win NET COM to the Universal Apps putting them into a single and simple package this is probably the most speedy and efficient way to adapt the traditional applications to the new platform I am going to explain why Project Centennial is a very good project and it will be able to massively easy developers lives but keep in mind that the following part is quite technical even if it is of fundamental importance to understand the mechanism Project Centennial is a tool that permits the conversion of the Classic Windows App CWA to the Universal Windows App UWA in order to be distributed through the Windows Store But how does it works The converter tool analyzes the installation file it records what happens during the installation what resources are installed what modifications are performed including directories libraries registry strings and so on At the end of the operations an AppX is generated even with its related live tiles Once the app is installed the various resources are not installed throughout the entire system partition but they are stored in the apps directory while the OS makes the app to believe that the resources are in the expected original positions For what regards the registry keys the keys are not registered in the Windows registry but into a different and separated registry file related to the specific application therefore this special registry file will be read only by the specific application but with a transparent access as if it was in the Windows Registry without being loaded at the system startup implying a light and speedy Windows In addition the CWA part will be run with fulltrust isolation environment similar to AppV Substantially these Universal Apps will be able to be completely installed and uninstalled without affecting the system filesarchitecture and the inherent system performance permitting to do a lot of things that CWAs are able to do today During the first months developers will be able to simply maintain the CWA into a subpackage paired to a UWA subpackage avoiding deep code changes In the meantime developers could work on converting the application code in order to put the entire content into a pure UWA application but it will take more time To sum up the previous technical insight The Universal App is composed of two parts the Universal one and the Classical one The Classical part is the traditional application that runs like in a sandbox The traditional application resources and registry keys wont be installed in the system but they will be stored within the application directory The transition of the Classical part into the Universal part could be done gradually while being already present on the Windows Store The fact that millions of applications are liable of being converted into Universal Apps in a very short period of time it enables the independent software vendors to quickly provide their applications on the Windows Store Obviously the full conversion of their applications will take a considerable period of time but in the meantime every Windows x device will be able to run these applications It is not difficult to see the entire picture the operative system becomes a little more controlled but more stable and performing on the long term and it becomes quite modular At the same time even the x mobile phones become eligible to run these apps Obviously not all the applications will be converted for example Windows NT Services drivers software that does not run at user context or operations that causes a normal user to get the UAC prompt will not be supported Another example is the personalized licensing system the Photoshop Elements preview for Centennial did not need any code change apart from the adoption of the Windows Store licensing system Another important future characteristic is the Continuitylike feature it will be possible to make phone calls send SMS and catch up what we were doing on the smartphone without any interruption This is practically what Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL Continuity actually does it permits to tie Windows Mobile to the desktop counterparts with a double wire massively improving the ecosystem and the productivity and providing a tempting feature for the Windows users Some days ago Eldar Murtazin exNokia insider Journalist and Blogger wrote an interesting article referring to some of his Microsoft insider contacts While he has not been always right he has made various scoops and his news are in line with what is going on In his article he stated that Microsoft will stop Lumia projects as they were from the previous teams which means that the Lumia will probably be the last Lumia in history Obviously if an hypothetic Lumia powered by Snapdragon is already at an advanced state it could be released but it is clear that the Lumia series is going to die But the real deal of this article is about the SoC and development choice according to Murtazins sources Microsoft is going to chose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC x SoCs in place of ARM NASDAQ ARMH Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM SoCs for the upcoming Surface Phones meaning that the ARM architecture would be completely excluded in the entire Microsoft lineup This doesnt mean that the ARM architecture will not be supported on the contrary it is already known that Windows Mobile is going to support ARM architecture therefore the various OEMs will very likely continue to adopt the Windows Mobile ARM version for future devices However Microsoft would implicitly declare a preference for the x support and it would draw a more consistent lineup where the Surface Phone would likely be a very highend product with the unique feature of a fullpower Continuum At the same time the fact that Microsoft could choose an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoC for its highend upcoming smartphone makes me think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is preparing something interesting powerful and efficient it may be a special Core M or the new Morganfield platform powered by the new Goldmont cores Today top performances with synthetic benchmarks are an important product advertisement even if it doesnt imply better usability and system fluidity or real better performance In addition synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench are quite unreliable a top first generation Core M outscores the AX by only in Geekbench multicore but it outclasses it in SPEC suite by average with peaks of pure vectorization In any case being a topend product the expectations for the upcoming SoCs are quite high We can say that Microsoft is aiming to follow the same steps of Apple or at least something similar High engineering Surface Pro and Lumia XL are at the top for heat dissipation engineering This is probably the right path to follow But even if I am confident that the future Microsoft will be very good from the hardwareengineering point of view the software side is to be seen the Continuum x compatibility with Universal Apps from Centennial will be a wow feature for sure but it is to be seen when Microsoft will release such tool and how much time it will take for developers to release the various universal application versions Anyway the Surface Phone has high chance to gain some market share in the highend market If such an event will happen Microsoft would be able to spread Windows Mobile even at the midend and lowend of the market through the OEMs and at the same time the OEMs would be pushed to reach Microsoft devices level Think about the Surface lineup and compare it with the various in generation the first in from the OEMs were quite underperforming and of lower quality but the latest Skylake generations from Lenovo HP and Dell are finally comparable to the Surface lineup It is possible that Microsoft will focus its Surface Phone line not only on the very highend of the market but also on some midhigh like the rumored model It is also possible that all the Lumia projects will be simply finalized without developing any further Lumia device Anyway the route for the highend market is quite clear If Microsoft does manage to bring on this roadmap with consistency and quickness it may exploit a waterfall effect through the other OEMs in a catchup run It would be able to tie more smartphone users to its Windows Desktop environment also increasing customer retention productivity and relative revenues from the services Given that the smartphone sector has always been quite soft for Microsoft good results from this segment would consistently increase the stock valuation and related sentiment At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a lot to earn from this roadmap it has never been able to place its SoCs into a highend smartphone and its entire smartphone market share is quite negligible If the future Microsoft highend products will adopt the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoCs even in the mobile sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be able to exploit a multiplier effect since various OEMs would be tempted to adopt its x SoCs in order to have the x Continuum feature If we also consider that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will move SoFIA to nm node and it will cover the midend offer the Santa Clara company has the chance to revolutionize its mobile situation Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MSFT INTC over
