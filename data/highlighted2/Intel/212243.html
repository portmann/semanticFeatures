Digitals plans of becoming a SSD giant in the postHDD world Micron <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Samsung are likely all building significant new capacity for D NAND that begins production in and Big demand for SSDs is coming soon The HDD in years will be what the floppy disk is today for young children technology that will only be seen in history books more like ebooks With Western Digital NASDAQ WDC now set to acquire NAND manufacturer SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK the foggy technology roadmap for Western Digital and the HDD Hard Disk Drive in general is starting to become clear Sales at Western Digital and Seagate NASDAQ STX peaked in the timeframe and have since started to taper off by single digit percentages annually Talk of the death of the PC and by extension death of the HDD has been discussed for years However HDD sales at the two giants of the industry have only dipped a bit pun intended in the last two years The era of a slow decline in HDD sales is coming to an end soon If the NAND manufacturers are not wildly off in their predictions HDD sales are about to experience enormous drops within years Western Digitals desire to acquire SanDisk is simple to understand Western Digital needs to find a source of revenue in its postHDD era SanDisk is the cost leader in production of planar NAND flash the NVM nonvolatile memory that serves as the underlying technology that allows for the storage of data in SSDs Solid State Drives Relative to HDDs SSDs are faster more durable weigh less and consume less power and therefore emit less heat In a nutshell virtually all performance metric of SSDs that do not involve cost are significantly better than those of HDDs Unsurprisingly everyone who has followed the storage industry knows with certainty that SSDs will eventually completely replace HDDs The only question that remains is When will it happen I wrote an article in September that discusses the issue of when HDD sales will fall off a cliff NAND manufacturers are building out their various versions of D NAND to increase the density of NAND dies which equates to lowering the cost per bit The NAND manufacturers plan to continuously lower the cost of NAND and get the price per GB of SSDs close to that of HDDs While Samsung OTCSSNLF SK Hynix OTCHXSCF SanDisk with Toshiba and Micron NASDAQ MU with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC have been working on lowering the cost of NAND Western Digital and Seagate have been trying to delay the death of the HDD by also finding new ways to improve their technology increase areal density to lower the cost per GB of HDDs The rate of decline in cost per bit for D NAND will be significantly higher than that of HDDs With the estimates I used in the article I estimated the big drop in HDD sales would occur sometime between late and early If Western Digital successfully acquires SanDisk I believe the cliff dive of HDD sales will occur in the very early parts of my late to early range The reason is simple Western Digital will simply cut back its RD expense to extend the life of the HDD roadmap and reallocate its resources to its SSD future Western Digital has spent billions on RD in the last few years to lower the cost per bit of HDDs because it had no other options With SanDisk Western Digital now has a way to survive without spending money on RD that has limited longterm value The combined entity will bet their collective futures on the rapid growth of SSDs at the expense of its core HDD business As a result I expect the cost per bit decline of HDDs will slow even more than it has over the last few years which will give an even better opportunity for SSD costs to come down to comparable levels This should be a significant longterm positive for all of the NAND manufacturers SanDisk is the cost leader in planar NAND but I suspect it will quickly lose that lead as the industry moves towards D NAND In D NAND SanDisks BiCS will likely initially cost more on a per bit basis than Samsungs VNAND which will have gone through a few iterations of improvement by the time SanDisk is shipping its D NAND in high volume SanDisk will not only be trailing Samsung but it will also be even further behind Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in D NAND cost per bit as the layer Gb TLC NAND of MicronIntel will be the highest density NAND solution in the market With SanDisk seemingly dragging its feet in the conversion to D NAND it would not be surprising for the duo of Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to already be on its next iteration of D NAND that will only increase its density and cost per bit advantage over SanDisk even more I strongly believe Samsungs billion fab will use the vast majority of its new wafers to build D NAND Wafers from this fab are supposed to start hitting the market as early as Micron is spending billion to expand its Singapore fab for D NAND <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced that it will upgrade one of its fabs in China to also build D NAND Microns fab in Singapore and Intels fab in China are expected to start shipping D NAND by the end of If Western Digital successfully acquires SanDisk I would immediately expect the combined entity perhaps with a friendly partner in China to quickly plan on building new capacity with or without Toshiba to increase its production of D NAND wafers to help facilitate Western Digitals conversion from its HDD past to its SSD future I would not be surprised if this new capacity expansion is of the megafab Samsunglike variety as all of the potential D NAND bit capacity of SanDisk is just a tiny fraction of the bit demand for Western Digital HDDs I want to address the news of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expanding its D NAND capacity in China separately from Micron its partner in NVM In a Seeking Alpha article published less than three weeks ago titled Micron and Beyond I wrote Another interesting note that Bedard mentions is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has mentioned that it is willing to manufacture D XPoint and D NAND separately from its joint venture with Micron This is not a sign of a breakdown in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron partnership This is a result of Intels expectation of demand for D XPoint and D NAND to be so high that Microns wafer capacity will be completely exhausted well before it is able to produce enough wafers to meet the markets huge demand for these two new nonvolatile memories That is the ultimate bullish statement and bodes extremely well for Microns longterm prospects if reality is anywhere close to Intels expectations With regards to D NAND my assessment that an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expansion is evidence of significant future demand has not changed Of course Micron would prefer if it had a stake right now in this Chinese fab that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will use to build more D NAND wafers This news of Intels expansion is slightly disappointing to me as a Micron investor because NAND capacity is going to increase possibly without Micron getting a cut of the profits from this expansion initially However according to this article on the StreetInsider Micron may participate in Intels China plant more in the future The companys joint fab strategy with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides flexibility Doug Freedman of Sterne Agee has also weighed in on the news of Intels Chinese expansion The Sterne Agee report states We believe the new investment target has been discussed by both INTC and MU thus indicating both companies confidence in D NAND and Xpoint a new memory technology developed by the JV The abovelinked article at Benzinga further states The supply agreement between the two companies remains unchanged with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>supplying Micron with D Xpoint and NAND bits if the latters internal production proves inadequate to meet demand Freedman pointed out that there could be a potential disruption to D NAND supply chain due to the lag time for conversion to D Xpoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>working with Micron in China seems like a strong possibility in the future The path to enormous profits in NVM is clear for both parties right now I dont think either is willing to attempt a big market share grab at the expense of the other if such a move would jeopardize this incredibly fruitful relationship I strongly believe the demand picture is so bright for D NAND and XPoint over the next decade that Micron shareholders will still be rewarded handsomely to the tune of well over share by Given the timeline of when I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Micron and Samsung along with my assumption of a massive increase in SanDisks D NAND capacity if it is acquired by Western Digital to start massively increasing the worlds supply of D NAND it is obvious that the giants of nonvolatile memory are making big bets on significant increases in demand over an extended period of time starting in Wall Street analysts seem to be viewing NAND capacity and HDD capacity as two distinct markets I believe current estimates of NAND demand by most analysts significantly underestimates the longterm growth potential of D NAND and XPoint and other future next generation NVMs because they are not making bold predictions of the growth of SSDS at the expense of HDDs Western Digitals acquisition of SanDisk will only further speed up the already aggressive estimates that the major NAND manufacturers are projecting internally Most children born today or later will likely see the image below in a decade and have the same response as year olds today have when they see the image of the floppy disks above The six member storage oligopoly of Western Digital SanDisk Samsung SK Hynix SanDisk with Toshiba and Micron with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be reduced to five if Western Digital acquires SanDisk I firmly expect the landscape of the industry in terms of market share to be vastly different in five yearsthan it is today I see the new Western DigitalSanDisk and Seagate as the laggards of the industry in terms of their technology roadmap In fact I would expect both the new Western DigitalSanDisk and Seagate to both be worth significantly less than Micron when the fog clears For now my only bet here is on Micron but the short thesis on Western Digital is starting to get
