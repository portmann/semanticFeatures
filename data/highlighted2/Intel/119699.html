Is In Serious Trouble But Theres Still Hope Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD reported Q earnings after the close on Thursday The company underperformed even its own lackluster revised guidance Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD reported earnings after the close on Thursday and the results were unsurprisingly dreary Even after issuing a warning just ten days ago and guiding lower revenue and gross margin than originally expected the company managed to underwhelm expectations As guided revenue declined sequentially from last quarter marking both the fifth straight quarter of declining revenue and the first quarter in years since AMD has reported quarterly revenue below billion The revenue decline was attributed to the decline of the PC market which impacted APU sales to OEMs I guess you can consider the QQ expected because management warned about it on July th but it is still very disappointing to see Speaking of disappointing in its warning to investors AMD lowered its expected gross margin from down to yet the gross margin for the quarter was even lower than the revised estimate Net loss for the quarter was million or a loss per share The warning all but guaranteed a net loss for AMD this quarter and even before the warning it was unlikely at best that the company would come close to breaking even One of the few bright spots for AMD was its Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom results Revenue increased sequentially due to higher sales of semicustom SoCs and fell yearoveryear mainly due to decreased server sales For Q management guided for a sequential revenue increase of or approximately million below a consensus estimate of billion This mirrors Intels NASDAQ INTC guidance for higher Q revenues over Q and might be signaling a gradual bottoming of the decline of the PC market is pretty much out of sight and out of mind for AMD and should be for AMD investors as well and will most likely be the companys best shot at recovering some market share from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>As I mentioned in my previous article on AMD will be a decisive year for the companys future and its very survival With massive debt looming revenue and gross margin declining and no earnings to speak of AMD is rapidly approaching a crossroads If the company cant pull something out of the hat next year terminal decline is almost guaranteed barring a buyout before it goes bankrupt Luckily for AMD investors the company has a legitimate shot at being competitive in especially with its newest x processor codenamed Zen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>just announced on Wednesday that it would be pushing its first nm offering codenamed Cannonlake out until late as opposed to its earlier expected arrival date of late or early As I wrote in an article on Thursday by cutting capex by billion and therefore delaying nm into late <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has passed up a great opportunity to deal the final blow to AMD By pushing Cannonlake off into late <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is giving AMD a chance for Zen to gain market share and reintroduce AMD into relevancy Its a long shot to be sure as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already had Broadwell and Skylake to perfect its nm architecture and will have a third generation of nm chips codenamed Kaby Lake come to market in late Considering that AMD is just now developing Zen its first nm chip the experience advantage is on Intels side However being stuck on nm and nm for a long time AMD engineers have had more copious experience in optimizing existing architecture so it will be interesting to see who comes out on top in According to AMDs updated roadmap will see Zen and thgeneration desktop and mobile APUs and GPUs on a FinFET process and will see Zen if you will ARM CPU K and a highperformance server APU With these offerings and the companys new capability to produce with FinFET technology a comeback by AMD for is not at all out of the question It will be a hard road back from the brink but it is by no means impossible If AMD takes a dive after earnings I am thinking about buying shares At that point the riskreward tradeoff will be favorable enough for me to take a gamble If anything I dont think that the US government will allow AMD to implode completely because that would leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as the sole x processor producer in the market That is a bad situation for consumers and for OEMs With only one supplier OEM margins will fall and the costs of this will be partially passed on further to the consumer For this reason it is likely that OEMs will be more inclined to award AMD design wins If the technology is somewhat similar in capability OEMs will have a greater incentive to give revenue towards AMD to ensure that there remain two suppliers in the market A vital is coming for AMD and how it executes could very well make or break the company There are still many risks involved but if the company can perform well in the coming year there is substantial upside AMD reported disappointing earnings as expected Investors should look towards which could be an inflection point for the company and the stock It will not be an easy battle nor one for the faint of heart but investors that dont fear risk should consider AMD as a possible turnaround Source AMD Is In Serious Trouble But Theres Still Hope Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may
