The Surface Signifies A Bright Future For Microsoft Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts Surface now finds itself in a position of being at the forefront of laptoptablet hybrid technology with even Apple drawing design cues from them Their strong position in the market regarding the new market for laptoptablet hybrids will yield handsomely as the market comes to age The innovation and design elements that went into the Surface tablet could signify a promising future for a new age of Microsoft innovative design and consequently sales Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has come a long way from being regarded as boring and thought to constantly churn out slow old and unreliable products Since they have rebounded not only in share price post crisis but also quality of product When they released Windows to remedy much of the negativity Vista brought to the overall perception of Windows and Microsoft during July of that year they started their turnaround The stock has more than doubled Now of course we have been in a strong bull market since that time but we should try to give credit where its due and Microsoft certainly deserves some To me they have been changing up the overall quality and form of their products placing much more emphasis on design and user experience Of course they are still far from perfect but it seems like what they are doing is paying off Instead of being the boring company known to only cater toward boring corporate environments they have actually been releasing cool stuff in recent years things I could imagine people really wanting Most notable recently is the Microsoft Surface line of laptoptablet hybrids I mean it cant be denied The thing is sexy Unlike past iterations of Microsoft innovation such as the laughable Zune this finally is something that is cool useful and something I can imagine much of the tech world actually using But I think the Surface is not just a product line that Microsoft released which finally works It signifies a bright new era of competitive Microsoft design sales and a strong position in a new formfactor of technology As the Surface continues to cement itself as a worthy and formidable piece of hardware investors may want to consider opening a position in Microsoft reap the various benefits it will bring I cant believe Im saying it myself either Microsoft being hip and emulated by others It seemed like it would never come But that time finally truly has with Apple NASDAQ AAPL announcing the new iPad pro with strikingly similar hardware additions such as the Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil They both serve identical functions as the Surface Keyboard Cover and Pen respectively And in a way the fact that Apple is going to release an addition to their iPad line which so closely resembles the Surface actually validates Microsofts design philosophy An interview with Ralf Groene Microsofts senior creative director and the lead designer of their surface captures the essence of their motif very well He says We have people from very different flavors people who are like classic and industrial designers material designers people with fashion design backgrounds D modelers and its a very diverse team Quality does not only look it also sounds and feels When you touch a keyboard and you hover with the Surface about a half an inch over it it finds its home and it clicks in And the sound is the result of high quality parts clicking together He seems very knowledgeable and pragmatic about what it takes to create a beautifully designed product and I really found it interesting how similar his description of quality is very similar to many of past Jony Ives interviews when describing his respective Appledesigned products Nonetheless Groene has gotten other things right as well In fact in he was an instrumental key in releasing the Microsoft Arc Mouse an accessory which has gained critical acclaim for its functional lightweight travelfriendly and minimalist design All in all when a company as well known and respected for its design such as Apple finds itself actually following in the path of Microsoft and adopting an important part of their form function towards their own product it only speaks good things about what Microsoft has accomplished with the Surface and hopefully what their design team can accomplish in the future One of the core reasons behind Apples recent success has been their impeccable design language and the Surface has shown me that Microsoft is capable of achieving that as well Microsoft will then be able to consequently reap similar rewards The laptoptablet hybrid market is catching on and Microsoft is positioned well According to Eric Smith and Peter King analysts at Strategy Analytics in their August report By in Tablet growth will show a fiveyear compound average growth rate CAGR of percent while Slate Tablet growth will amount to a percent fiveyear CAGR Microsoft has legitimized the Windowsbased Tablet with the Surface Pro and the lowercost Surface in combination with the boom in in Tablet sales Windows Tablet market share will reach by the end of in tablets are expected to continually outpace tablet growth of a slate form factor in the near future And the Surface will be able to take full advantage of this Tablet and Touchscreen Strategies Service Director Peter King believes The timing could not be better for in Tablets as Windows makes the multimode computing experience smoother Intels Skylake processors hit the market at the end of and Windows Tablets have become more cost competitive with Android Tablets Windows provides a familiar environment for traditional PC vendors to compete in the Tablet market and also gives CIOS a higher level of comfort when considering higherend Tablets in the commercial setting Basically as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC hopefully continuously improves the powercost and performance of their processors hybrid tablets like the Surface will become increasingly more viable as a result Because they are already running a familiar operating system for many enterprises if they end up considering a newer tablet to further modernize their workflow and I bet they will then the Surface will be their first pick If the Surface is the first choice for the rapidly growing amount of enterprises that will choose to eventually purchase in tablets one can be sure that Microsoft will be in a formidable position in the market Better design and the Surface means there will be better future sales for Microsoft in the future According to the aforementioned Ralf Groene Microsofts senior creative director the future of the Surface will be similar to how the Volkswagen Golf attained stunning success The Golf was initially loathed but as people came to understand its utility it was a hatchback and versatility you could fold the back seats down and expand the storage space they grew to love it And the Golf did indeed define a new car category I think this will come true in the future Although the Surface has not yet reached mass adoption and acclaim it can do many things that people would feasibly need it for Groene also says that Surface devices will continue to bridge the divide between personal and work just as Windows does They will continue to be premium devices made of premium materials They will be tools designed for getting the job done not pure consumption devices though people will of course also browse the Internet and perform other consumption activities too Surface devices will continue to meet peoples expectationsa USB port for example or videoouteven though these additions can hinder the purity of the design They will continue to be designed to get out of the way and let the content that users are interacting with be the focus Surface devices will also continue to focus on productivity They will continue to work with a pen and will continue to be very portable to offer what Groene calls schoolbagability I agree with all of these principles that Microsoft aims to stick to and it seems like their target market does too It cant be denied their numbers back it up After their release of the Surface and the Surface Pro their fantastic results have removed all doubt that the Surface is a potentially extremely lucrative product line that Microsoft should aim to further develop In their recent Q results during the past July Surface tablet revenues grew percent to million driven by Surface Pro and Surface which were launched in June and May respectively Fullyear sales rose percent to exceed billion In fiscal Surface sales hit billion up from s less than billion Executive VPchief financial officer Amy Hood said enterprise sales accelerated in the quarter and that Surface sales were particularly strong to educational customers Our differentiated products as well as improved discipline and execution helped to improve gross margins by over million this quarter and billion in fiscal she said Said CEO Satya Nadella Surface is clearly a product where weve gotten the formula right earned fans and can apply this formula to other parts of our hardware portfolio In their K for their fiscal year of When considering that with the fact that Apples iPad revenue fell over the same time period the strong growth and competition posed from the Surface is palpable And this is all great because although the Surface actually constitutes a relatively minor part of Microsofts profits increased outreach of it will bring consumers into the Microsoft ecosystem of software and cloud services And those are huge profit generators All in all I think that the Surface shows a sign of a bright and positive future for Microsoft I think that their design team really hit the ball out of the park with the creation of the Surface line of products and I have little doubt that as time goes on it will gradually catch fire and attain mass outreach The Surface is also an effective gateway for users to end up purchasing other Microsoft products such as Office and of course the Windows operating system Therefore it provides a strong catalyst for the case of stronger sales and outlook for Microsoft in the future in both company health and stock valuation We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
