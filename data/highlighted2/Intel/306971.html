SPWR SSNLF STPFQ TSL TXN WDC YGE Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article China is attempting to dominate the semiconductor smartphone supply chain through MA activity China is attempting to dominate the LCD smartphone supply chain through MA activity China has already decimated competition for rare earth elements and solar industries in the past decade and a similar scenario may take place in the semiconductor and LCD smartphone supply Through a series of clever systematic manipulations China now owns the rare earth element market and the solar market China is now moving to dominate the smartphoneApple semiconductor NASDAQ AAPL supply chain and liquid crystal display LCD market I noted in a June Seeking Alpha article entitled Mainland Chinas Integrated Circuit Production Lost Ground In Meeting Domestic Demand despite massive investments in Chinas semiconductor industry production is making minimal impact on meeting growing demand here While Chinas IC production increased in IC demand for insertion into consumer and mobile devices increased The significant supply demand deficit of ICs continues to expand Figure The red line is for ICs made in China irrespective of whether they were made by domestic manufacturers or foreign companies in China such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Samsung SK Hynix Toshiba or Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN the top The blue line is for imports only and includes ICs made by the top and others above but not in their plants in China The National Guideline for Development of the IC Industry program unveiled in June is designed to accelerate Chinas efforts in several areas such as nm FinFETs advanced packaging MEMS and memory China created a billion fund which will be used to invest in its domestic IC firms Over the next decade local municipalities and private equity firms could spend billion across Chinas IC sector The Made in China program initiated in May is to upgrade and increase the domestic content of components in key areasinformation technology robotics aerospace shipping railways energy systems and vehicles power equipment materials medicine and agricultural machinery However it faces strong entry barriers in terms of technology and innovation as well as strong competition in a maturing industry Hence the country resorted to acquiring companies in the United States and Taiwan as well as inviting semiconductor companies from across the globe to build fabs in the mainland Bernstein senior analyst Mark Li said in a report on Monday January here The country is interested in all parts of the semiconductor supply chain and is keen to leverage its ample capital supply to elevate the capabilities of its domestic industry quickly Chinese manufacturers use memory devices in most electronic devices but the country has no homegrown memory manufacturer XMC based in Hubai is a foundry and functions to make chips for other companies XMC produces NOR on a foundry basis for Spansion now part of Cypress Spansion and XMC also are working on D NAND SK Hynix has been manufacturing DRAMs in China for a number of years And in Samsung began ramping up its new mm fab in Xian China which is expected to produce D NAND <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced in October that its China fab will be converted from the production of nm chipsets to D NAND and D XPoint over the next few years In March Uphill Investment Co a group of Chinese investors led by Summitview Capital offered to buy Milpitasbased Integrated Silicon Solution Inc NASDAQ ISSI for million ISSI is a USbased nicheoriented memory supplier Chinabased Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd made an unsuccessful effort to acquire US memory chip maker Micron Technology NASDAQ MU The United States rejected Tsinghuas offer to acquire Micron Technology over security concerns Also Micron acquired a stake in Inotera a joint DRAM venture in Taiwan between Nanya and Micron to protect its IP from Chinese investors In addition Chinese legislators charged USbased Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM for antitrust issues Tsinghua plans to plow more than billion into a new memorychip plant and acquisitions of semiconductor companies as the Chinese stateowned company continues a drive to build a globally competitive chip maker Tsinghua will build a memorychip factory and make further acquisitions through a newly acquired subsidiary Tongfang Guoxin Electronics Co according to a Tongfang Guoxin filing on the Shenzhen stock exchange in early November The filing that it will raise billion Yuan billion in a private placement Tsinghua struck a deal for a million stake in Taiwans Powertech Technology Inc a Taiwanese chip packaging and testing company Tsinghua already has invested billions in chip acquisitions buying China chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications for billion and RDA Microelectronics for million in and In November Tsinghua invested billion in Irvine Califbased Western Digital NASDAQ WDC a month after Western Digital agreed to buy Milpitas Califbased flash chip maker SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK for billion After being denied the opportunity to acquire Micron the Chinese have set their sights on the semiconductor company since it will give them access to the nm FinFET technology Chinabased Hua Capital Management which manages the national semiconductor industry investment fund has approached Advanced Technology Investment ATIC the owner of GlobalFoundries for possible acquisition or cooperation which was announced in September GlobalFoundries the manufacturing spinoff of Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD with fabs in Singapore Germany and the US oilrich Abu Dhabi owns the company and might be looking for a buyer Currently Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation SMIC which is the largest wafer foundry house situated in China is only manufacturing nm chips If the acquisition of GlobalFoundries is confirmed then the semiconductor manufacturing company will gain access to the nm FinFET technology allowing it leapfrog over TSMC a company which is intending on jumping from nm FinFET to nm FinFET China and the smartphone supply chain First of all China already owns the Apple and smartphone supply chain but several key semiconductors such as memory and logic are made by foreign suppliers China has Apple suppliers compared to in Japan and in the US China is now in the process of acquiring andor attempting to acquire some of these companies Lets take a closer look at the Apple supply chain and how it fits with the Chinese acquisition strategy All this MA activity really wont do much toward making China dominating the semiconductor market like it did the REE and solar industries in this lifetime unless it takes over Taiwan But there may be more than meets the eye According to Investopedia the major companies tied to the Apple supply chain are here Analog Devices Inc NASDAQ ADI provides the capacitive touch screen controllers for the iPhones and the Apple watch It supplies these components from Ireland the Philippines and USbased facilities Glu Mobile Inc NASDAQ GLUU is a major provider of iOS apps and mobile games Jabil Circuit Inc NYSE JBL Jabils manufacturing facilities are based in China It supplies phone casings for Apple Micron Technology Inc Micron and its subsidiary companies like Elpida Memory are based in multiple locations across the US Taiwan Singapore China and Japan They supply various memory modules like DRAM LPDDR and LPDDR for Apple devices These modules are used by smartphones and electronic devices to efficiently multitask and run various applications The recent iPhone uses LPDDR while the company is currently testing the next version LPDDR which is expected to be up to faster and low on power consumption Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd Murata is based in Kyoto Japan and supplies to Apple from manufacturing facilities spread across China Japan Vietnam Singapore and Indonesia Apple and Samsung are Muratas top two clients procuring ceramic capacitors from the company Nidec Corp The much anticipated Apple Watch comes with a special device called a taptic engine which produces a sensation of being tapped on the wrist Japanbased Nidec has emerged as the key supplier of this technology Nidec was established in and is a global market leader in smartphone vibration motors Qualcomm Inc is known to supply multiple electronic components to Apple including Envelope Power Tracker Baseband Processor Power Management module and GSMCDMA Receiver and Transceiver These are various instruments used in the devices power management systems and in mobile signaling However the most important component that is missing from the Apples own Achip processor is the cellular baseband modem Qualcomm has filled this important space for Apple devices offering the needed modem technology Samsung With three different subsidiaries Samsung ElectroMechanics Co Ltd Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Samsung SDI Co Ltd which are located in four different countries South Korea China the US and the Philippines Samsung is one of Apples major suppliers It supplies multiple components including flash memory which is used for storing data content the mobile DRAM used for multitasking various applications in devices and the application processors which are responsible for controlling and keeping the whole device running STMicroelectronics supplies a lowpowered threeaxis gyroscope and accelerometer to Apple used to detect the orientation and altitude of a mobile device Along with Apple STMs top clients include BlackBerry Nokia and Cisco Texas Instruments Inc TI serves Apple through its multiple facilities spread across Taiwan the US Malaysia Japan Mexico the Philippines the United Kingdom Germany and China In the Apple Watch TI is expected to provide the current operational amplification system which in turn contains different components itself For iPhones and iPads it supplies the touchscreen controller power management chip and a control device As discussed above Tsinghua Unigroup made an unsuccessful effort to acquire US memory chip maker Micron Technology No on the above list As I said above Hua Capital Management has approached Advanced Technology Investment ATIC the owner of GlobalFoundries for possible acquisition or cooperation That will benefit SMIC Chinas largest foundry which is currently under agreement to mass produce nm chips for Qualcomm IMEC and Huawei in Qualcomm is No on the above list However SMIC can currently make only nm chips Acquiring the GlobalFoundries technology will move it into nm capabilities in If the Chinese follow their same IP strategy we can see a push for them to take business from Qualcomm in the intervening four years Currently GlobalFoundries manufactures the nm FinFET under a license from Samsung which may throw a wrench into the acquisition In what I think is an effort to block any acquisition by the Chinese remember I said above Micron acquired a stake in Inotera to protect its IP Qualcomm announced in midJanuary Samsung will be its sole supplier of its Snapdragon here Hua Capital Management also acquired smartphone camera sensor manufacturer OmniVision The company the second largest smartphone camera sensor maker in the world competes with Sony NYSE SNE and Samsung in the camera sensor market According to my June article in Seeking Alpha entitled TFTLCD Display And Equipment Markets Set For Downturn In here TFTLCD thin film transistorliquid crystal display market growth has been stymied by a slowdown in PC monitors notebooks and tablets K LCD TVs smartphones and automotive displays are driving forces for the market but the display market is forecast to be flat to down in According to market research company IHS China is quickly adding capacity in all flatpanel display FPD manufacturing segments and is forecast to become the leading manufacturing region in the world for displays by Despite growing concerns of oversupply for the next several years in most parts of the display industry there is still little evidence that Chinese makers are reconsidering or scaling back their ambitious expansion plans The ongoing issue of LCD oversupply worsened by Chinas aggressive investment in production capacity as well as high fab utilization will continue well into The supply of largearea LCD is expected to be greater than demand in up from in Like the semiconductor industry China must import LCDs to meet production needs in TVs computer monitors and smartphones China currently makes only about onethird of the panels it needs with BOE Technology Group the leading producer of FPDs in China Chinese display makers are expected to account for of global LCD production in up from in according to LG Display NYSE LPL BOE Technology saw its largesize panel shipments and consolidated revenues for increase and respectively BOEs overall production capacity in will grow for largesize panels inches and for small to mediumsize ones By maintaining high levels of LCD production the Chinese will have a negative impact on global LCD suppliers profit margins which include top market leaders LG Display and Samsung Display OTCSSNLF based in Korea Innolux CPT and AU Optronics NYSE AUO based in Taiwan and Sharp OTCPKSHCAY and Panasonic based in Japan LCDs compete with OLEDs organic lightemitting diodes for smartphones It is estimated that smartphones were shipped in with OLEDs up from in Apple uses a particularly highquality LCD using LTPS low temperature polysilicon in its iPhone and iPhone Plus However according to Nikkei Asian Review here Apple plans to introduce organic lightemitting diode displays for iPhones starting in South Koreas Samsung Electronics is currently the only company that can reliably massproduce OLED smartphone screens LG Display has a track record for producing OLEDs for television screens Given this the two companies will likely supply a large portion of Apples displays As shown in Table Samsung is the predominant practically only smartphone manufacturer using OLEDs instead of LCDs according to the OLED Association The forecast shows that Apple will introduce OLEDs in Table shows the percentage of smartphones incorporating OLEDs instead of LEDs OLEDs will represent only of all smartphones sold in and sold in But this large number is highly skewed because of the Samsung smartphones and to a lesser extent Nokia NYSE NOK and Apple The vast majority of smartphones including iPhones will be manufactured with LEDs Hence according to my analysis the rationale for attempted Chinese dominance in LEDs and perhaps a repeat of REE and solar markets During the past years there has been an explosion in demand for many items that require rare earth metals China being China capitalized on its rich REE deposits and cheap labor to drive down prices to a point that nearly every mine outside China was forced to shut down because they couldnt compete on price The ROW being the ROW allowed China to take away business because of cheap labor In China cut export quotas for the minerals needed to make hybrid cars and magnets for wind turbines smartphones computers and televisions by The result at the end of the composite price of the REE oxides tripled If that isnt enough China dominates the critical supply chain Rare earth materials require a number of processing stages before they can be used in an application Mining rare earth ore from the mineral deposit Separating the rare earth ore into individual rare earth oxides Refining the rare earth oxides into metals with different purity levels Forming the metals into rare earth alloys and Manufacturing the alloys into components such as permanent magnets used in defense and commercial applications Based on industry estimates rebuilding a US rare earth supply chain may take up to years and is dependent on several factors including securing capital investments in processing infrastructure developing new technologies and acquiring patents which are currently held by international companies I pointed out in a July Seeking Alpha article entitled Solar Is Hot But Woe To Solar Equipment Suppliers here that seven out of the worlds top ten manufacturers of solar panels are Chinabased companies as shown in Table below In China manufactured GW of solar panels representing of global production In that percentage increased to about five times the capacity of the Hoover Dam There was billion in capital moving into the solar industry in The largest individual transactions were debt financing arrangements by the China Development Bank Beijing China with recipients including LDK Solar Company Ltd OTCPKLDKYQ for USD billion Suntech Power Holding Company Ltd OTCPKSTPFQ for USD billion and Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Ltd for USD billion In March Linuo Group Co another solar firm said it had secured a billion Yuan billion loan from CDB The packages these enterprises receive include cash grants tax benefits and low interest loans with the longest expiry date up to six years China has long been the worlds largest manufacturer or solar panels and the industry famously used lowcost government loans to expand solar panel production dramatically causing solar prices to hit their current historic lows That strategy also led many Chinese solar manufacturers to crash and burn China Development Bank the stateowned policy bank created in to support the governments economic and infrastructure goals had billion in loans on its books at the end of more than twice as much as the World Bank As Chinese factories cranked out panels prices around the world fell Between and the price of solar panels dropped from to per watt pushing many American solar companies into bankruptcy The list below is for alone CSG cSi on glass closed by Suntech Gi DSCs bankrupt in reemerged as Gi Power with new investors Oelmaier Germany inverters insolvent bought by agricultural supplier Lehner Agrar QCells cSi insolvent acquired by South Koreas Hanwha Sharp aSi backing away from aSi retiring of its megawatts in Japan Solon cSi acquired by UAEs Microsol SolFocus layoffs restructuring for sale Sunways cSi inverters bought by LDK restructuring to focus on BIPV and storage The US Commerce Department levied tariffs of more than percent on imports of Chinese solar panels in May As exports shrank the balance sheets of many Chinese companies began to bleed A number of them went out of business Suntech Power based in China one of the worlds largest solar panel makers with about workers filed for bankruptcy in March International creditors are still trying to recoup millions lent to the company In the Hanergy Thin Film Power Group a Chinese company which is a world leader in the manufacture of solar products said it swung to a net loss of million Hong Kong dollars million in the six months ended in June compared with a net profit HK billion in the same period last year In Yingli Green Energy was plagued by solvency fears and failed to make a full debt payment but surged in October after announcing a partial payment of M Yingli is discussing how to repay on M of outstanding notes which are due in May The top global solar manufacturers Trina Solar Canadian Solar Jinko Solar JA Solar and the top American Solar manufacturers First Solar and SunPower NASDAQ SPWR The Chinese through a calculated series of maneuvers has managed to not only dominate the rare earth and solar industries but to practically eradicate nearly all the competition I see a similar pattern in the LCD industry with the Chinese focusing on the smartphone supply chain but also with a focus on the lucrative TV market In semiconductors the Chinese are part of global MA activity that reached monumental heights in But a strategic emphasis is on dominating the semiconductor smartphone market Already China is the manufacturing center for smartphones but semiconductors used in their assembly are manufactured by foreign companies It is my assertion that the Chinese wish to change that Therefore investors in public companies need to consider those companies in the smartphoneApple supply chain based on contracts they may receive But in a greater extent on those companies in the supply chain that may be acquisition targets by the Chinese </div></body></html>
