class='textDiv'>Intels Next Merger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recently completed the purchase of Altera and has talked about additional purchases to further increase its growth Intels growth areas include data center specifically cloud computing high performance computing and network function virtualization for the telecom industry IoT and nonvolatile memory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC recently completed the purchase of Altera with the intent to integrate Altera IP into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors to significantly grow Intels data center and IoT businesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had partnered with Altera for several years to get to know the IP and the people Only after this extended engagement did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>decide to buy the company This approach does not minimize the purchase price but it does dramatically increase the potential for successfully integrating Altera IP and personnel into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Look for IP that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can integrate into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors to increase growth If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sees an opportunity to expand its reach into markets it tends not to buy the company but instead invest in the company For example Intels investments into Chinese companies show a clear pattern and strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has put nearly billion in over Chinabased companies to date That figure includes its billion investment in chip maker Beijing UniSpreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics share of Tsinghua Unigroup last year and million into eight firms over the last year According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The investments demonstrate Intels commitment to fostering Chinese technology innovation and accelerating Chinas technology ecosystem development <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely continue to focus its buying on companies that provide IP needed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to better serve the IoT and NFV telecom industry complete purchases are often needed to integrate IP into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors A previous article described how the Altera purchase Altera IP integration into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>pursue the billion total addressable market associated with NFV billion and IoT billion All but about billion could be new business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In addition to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seeing critical IP that it needs for its growth goals it has also shown that indepth knowledge of the benefits of necessary IP can only be achieved through an existing partnership between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and the potential company to be purchased <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>worked with Altera for several years before buying it This approach may not bring the best price but it increases the chances of success in implementing the integration of the new IP into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products This long engagement provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with great insights into the IP understanding of the benefits of integrating the IP and establishment of good working relationships with the companys key employees First lets review who is likely not on the list Then the list will transition to more likely full purchases Maybe I am missing something please correct me if I missed something or add your thoughts in comments Micron NASDAQ MU Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has worked closely with Micron for years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already has all the access to Micron IP that it needs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>developed most of the technology There is no need to buy the headaches associated with a commoditybased company Very unlikely Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM There may be some IP that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would want but the partnerships have not existed The IP that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may want is focused in the mobile phone area which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not currently pursuing as a current growth area Unlikely Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC I dont see Applied Micro IP that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could integrate into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does not seem to simply buy competitors to reduce competition likely such a purchase would be blocked anyway as reducing competition I dont see any existing partnerships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Unlikely Lattice Semiconductor NASDAQ LSCC Seems to be close to Altera with the type of IP but may add some IP that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs I dont see any existing partnerships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Unlikely Chinese Companies See discussion above Likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to partner with Chinese companies to expand the footprint of x in China I dont see the IP that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs Buying a Chinese company would likely not be received well by Chinas government Chinese company outright purchases are very unlikely Inphi NYSE IPHI <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Inphi have been partnering for many years It is not clear if Inphi has IP that could be integrated into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products but maybe Inphi talks about partnering with a company for Silicon Photonics maybe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Silicon Photonic Gigabit module partner for enterprise in a big way in Maybe Cloudera A company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has worked closely with over several years is Cloudera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>owns at least of Cloudera privately held and relies on Cloudera for cloud system software related to Hadoop To make Cloudera a buy candidate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would need to see some IP that it can integrate into its hardware Maybe Cloudera seems to be mostly software and services so maybe not I dont see any clear strong candidates Please add in comments your thoughts on companies that may meet the criteria <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has made clear IP to be integrated into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products to grow faster AND ongoing relationshippartnership <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>likely has some candidates and will reveal them AFTER the deal is done Speculation about specific companies is hard and likely not going to reveal good longterm investments Speculation will likely continue to move potential acquisition stocks on a shortterm basis Intels approach of investing in IP that can be profitably integrated into Intels products is a great strategy and will have strong longterm benefits to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shareholders If you foresaw the decline of desktop sales with the transition to more mobile devices that have the power that most need for surfing the internet email messaging etc you may have exited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a while ago as a longterm investment Are you aware that messaging apps are now replacing even recent growth companies such as Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Some message apps allow a user to message for a Uber ride message to check your bank balance check your stocks message to order a pizza message to find the weather without ever leaving the message app Messaging using voice commands is growing too Talk to your device like your personal assistant Things change Keep changing to live long and prosper Intels growth areas are now cloud computing HPC NFV IoT NVM and more mobile computing The first three are the biggest current growth areas Cloud HPC NFV The last three are developing into significant growth areas Growing into all six of these areas requires lots of new IP Some of these IP can be grown organically and some are quicker and less expensive if acquired through mergers So far the growth in these new areas is replacing profits lost with the decline of desktop unit sales Soon these new growth areas will grow faster than desktop sales decline That is when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock will take off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is
