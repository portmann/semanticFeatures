The Winner Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Sep PM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation INTC Includes AMD FSC IBM MU QCOM TXN by Russ Fischer Most semiconductor companies have underestimated how much it costs to stay viable over the long term The history of the semiconductor business is littered with the bodies of companies who gave themselves away through low price A reader recently posted a comment that started me thinking He suggested that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC might be justified in their high margin pricing I wrote the following answer to his comment and then thought to share it with the Seeking Alpha community as a whole by posting it as an article Youve hit on a very subtle point It is very expensive to continually advance the state of the art in semiconductors and is getting even more expensive all the time Perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the ONLY semiconductor company that understands how much it costs to maintain this leadership over a year timeframe The giveawayartists are all gone Fairchild Semiconductor NASDAQ FSC Fairchild is Where the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>founders came from One of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>founders Robert Noyce invented the Planar Process while at Fairchild The Planar process is still the foundation for the lithographic magic used to make integrated circuit to this day Fairchild owned the patent to the planar process and was paid royalties by everyone in the semiconductor business for many years Fairchild spawned National Semiconductor National AMD NASDAQ AMD and many other players in the business Fairchild itself fell on bad times and was sold over and over again until finally National wound up buying them National spun them off as the discrete transistor company they started as What a humiliation National Semiconductor itself was finally bought by Texas instruments NASDAQ TXN pretty much for their customer list National was running mm production lines when the big players had been at mm for a decade National and Fairchild were the victims of not not being able to investing in the manufacturing end of the business Motorola Semiconductor They lost the IBM Corp NYSE IBM PC design and were never the Motorola I knew again Now they are Freescale NYSE FSL big deal Texas Instruments the coinventor of the integrated circuit soldiers on in the analog business much of which they bought Even TI could no longer compete in the bleeding edge technology after nm When the inevitable price war comes on analog ICs TI will be half their present size All the Japanese semiconductor companies were finally just bundled up as Elpida and sold to Micron NASDAQ MU for wait a minute they were given awayand the first lesson that post Elpida Micron shareholders learned is that it takes a crazy level of spending to keep the technology current and that there is no free lunch as some pundits seem to think Anyone remember Signetics AMD What a joke Even the mighty IBM had to bribe Global Foundries to take the obsolete IBM fabs off their hands <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is unique in the semiconductor business They have sustained very high margins in a cutthroat business They were able to do this by moving the technology along at a breathtaking pace and employing withering tactics to protect their intellectual property <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not always a warm and fuzzy company They have been brutal as a mother bear in protecting their business from lesser competition thank you very much Andy Grove <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought into Moores Law and never let go For those who think ticktocktock is letting go of Moores Law think again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is just catching their breath and solving the memorywall problem and memory cost problem with D NAND and D XP memory technologies The x increase in bit density represented by D XP over DRAM and the density of the IntelMicron approach to D NAND if applied to ALL transistors made not just Intels transistors all transistors would amount to a total industry node shrink or more There Mr electronics technology consumer a free node shrink with the associated cost decreases hows that for a gift from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>leads through process technology and materials science and lesser competitors follow through reverse engineering and theft of intellectual property Weve come to the point where the ending notes of this tune are Samsung OTCSSNLF TSMC NYSE TSM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Samsung now has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a competitor in memory in the form of D XP nonvolatile RAM Samsung doesnt have a nonvolatile RAM Samsung has DRAM and NAND and even D NAND Unlike Samsung <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a lock on much of the processor business where the memory will be used Unlike Samsung <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a pure play components supplier they dont compete with their customers in end markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will win the battle TSMC is a fine company founded by Morris Chang as a timeshared semiconductor foundry The company has grown into a huge and innovative business serving fabless semiconductor companies that dont have the scale to build their own fab TSMC bless their heart is slugging it out on bleeding edge semiconductor foundry technology with Samsung at the moment Both Samsung and TSMC are sharing business at the whims of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM The foundry business of necessity is much lower margin than the ODM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>business model There simply isnt enough bleeding edge business at foundry margins to support the cost of the technology arms race for both TSMC and Samsung One will have to back off Whoever backs off first will be out of the race forever I think TSMC will continue leadership in the broadbased foundry business at one node behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and regretting that they ever entered the node arms race with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has just entered the memory onramp Samsung will be very busy protecting their turf for the next several years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needed higher performance memory and Samsung and the others didnt respond So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had to do it themselves The irony of continued shrink wars between Samsung and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is that every shrink brings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>closer to the point of including both RAM and storage inside the CPU package to be lost to the outside suppliers forever That RAM and storage do eventually go in the CPU package is inevitable and quite near term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has about billion in untouchable recurring annual business in client and server CPU business add the RAM Business at billion and the storage business at billion and you can see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>becomes a billionplus revenue company in the not too distant future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will supply about of the value of the total semiconductor market The rest of the simple numbers will be net earnings billion share shrinking rapidly for share PE for share price growing due to share reductions Oh yeah dont forget that dividend which itself will justify a share price Buy the stock and turbo charge the gains with some Jan LEAPS As Andy
