prices are falling Big customers want to reduce their dependence on Qualcomm Baseband and application processors competitiveness will spike in coming years Qualcomm is overvalued compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>its a longterm sell Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ QCOM is facing headwinds this year royalty share is decreasing technology prominence in G and G is soft customers are building their own application processors and the share price looks quite overvalued compared to certain competitors The company may regain some price value once Snapdragon will be released if we assume that this SoC will be competitive against competitors and if we assume that overheating issues are old memories First of all the royalty business is a problem not to be underestimated Qualcomms customers like Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL are pushing to cut royalties fees related to old technologies and it looks like this trend is not over at all Qualcomm has a rich portfolio in the G sector but that is not the same for the G and G sectors Indeed its average royalty rate has been decreasing steadily for seven years Given that the average smartphone price is currently decreasing royalties are affected because they are generally priced in relation to retail smartphone prices China also is the source of several issues Chinese OEMs are underreporting orders Wang Xiang has been hired by Xiaomi and Chinese companies are increasingly adopting anticompetitive behaviors Qualcomm has a high exposure to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd OTC SSNLF and Apple the revenues derived from these two companies increased from of to of besides which this supplying share is still rising Its obvious that such a heavy reliance is not healthy to Qualcomm because an eventual Samsung and Apple detachment from Qualcomms products would deeply hit revenues and market share While other companies implemented and heavily criticized the Snapdragon Samsung has directly skipped this SoC due to overheating problems Tim McDonough Qualcomms VP of Marketing tried to pour oil on troubled waters stating that customers have simply overestimated the SD overheating issues Every SD smartphone faced lower battery life compared to the previous models and competitors phones Moreover certain companies had to lower the TDP to achieve better thermal dissipation Anandtech has shown that the average power consumption of LG Flex SD is higher than previous SD typical systems and the same goes for power efficiency It means indeed that SD is a very hot and energy consuming SoC even if other system components must be considered Every smartphone faces some kind of thermal throttling but SD throttles quite more than competitors You can see its behavior here It is also known that Samsung will probably use both the next SD and Exynos news news in its highend offer but anyhow its already clear that Samsung is planning to lower dependence on Qualcomm in the coming years Obviously its not possible to exclude that customers tried to exploit the heat issue to reduce the SoCs price since nearly every customer company loudly complained about it Speaking about Apple the company is succeeding in cutting down Qualcomms royalties and it will likely reduce its dependence on Qualcomms baseband chips It may happen because Apple has the tendency to not massively lean on one single company but it prefers to diversify its supplies Apple has already been switching from Samsung to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd NYSE TSM and vice versa in application processors but last reports claimed that Apple is stocking up A SoCs from both Samsung and TSMC pushing them to lower prices Qualcomms customers are already showing the will to create their own chips in order to optimize costs and to reduce their dependence on Qualcomm While some companies already have the knowhow to do it others will be able to in the coming years starting from Samsung Samsung already has demonstrated its ability to build and design excellent SoCs The Exynos clearly was the best SoC of thanks to a good design and to the nm FinFet production node made possible by Samsungs high quality foundries The company implemented the Exynos to substitute the SD therefore Samsung is likely to promote its own offer in the coming years even if it will still use SD in Samsung will release the successor next year a SoC that will be based on the new Mongoose core a modified ARM A architecture This approach is similar to Apples Cylone and Qualcomms Krait and Kryo cores As you can see in the next image Samsungs Mongoose M provides ace performances compared to the other competitors The posted image below simply collects the various leaked benchmarks discovered on the web Leaked benchmarks have been very reliable in recent years Exynos M reaches a Geekbench result of points in single thread and points in multithreading Such a powerful SoC would simply crush the competition concerning the CPU part disregarding the unknown TDP for a while Considering the high quality design the provided performances and its foundries quality Samsungs products become more and more compelling Beyond this the Korean company could also augment its SoCs employment on different devices a possible plan supported by the leaked info recently found on the web that shows another Exynos numbered powering a new device Samsung Lucky It will provide a performance similar to Exynos and it will come with GB of DDR This plan is more credible if we consider that Samsung is supplying its Exynos to other companies like Meizu as shown on an Antutu page with the model Niux It becomes even more credible if we consider recent news that was released on September The core Ananke that will substitute A and A lowendmidend is already being tested and it will be produced in a bigLITTLE package in late This last info consistently supports old news concerning Samsungs nm FinFet node technology The fact that Samsung is working on midlowend SoCs makes it unquestionable that this company wants to exploit its own foundries at full power maybe to become a major player in the application processors segment All of this makes me think that Samsung will steal some market share from both Qualcomm and TSMC implying a remarkable revenue reduction for the US company Huawei Huawei owns HiSilicon which is going to release Kirin and in the coming months These SoCs will be produced with nm node technology and they will provide quite astonishing performances Given the miniaturization level and the integration of the last ARM GPU Mali T and T implementation the Tensilica HiFi very good DSP and the dualsim LTE Cat modems these SoCs are brand new and competitive in every aspect Considering that this also is a Chinese company with the potential of delivering competitive prices Huawei is likely to attract a high number of customers further eroding Qualcomms revenues Xiaomi Xiaomi acquired Leadcore the fifth SoC Chinese producer It will release some entry level SoCs to substitute the Qualcomm ones in Beyond this Leadcore is planning to gradually use its SoCs even in the midend market in the coming years The LC SoC will power Xiaomi Redmi A and provides better performances in comparison to SD This shows that this company is already doing a good job with such a small firm Moreover Leadcores SoCs may reduce Qualcomms revenues coming from the entry level market LG LG Electronics Inc OTC LGEAF has been designing the Nuclun architecture for two years now As you have seen in the previous image Nuclun performs on par to competitors but well below Mongoose M It will be built at TSMCs foundries with the nm node technology like Kirin and it will come with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cellular modem and will be massively produced in H Qualcomm will eventually perceive reduced revenues from LG given that the Korean companys most famous and best selling smartphones are Qualcomm powered at the moment Nvidia Nvidia Corporation NASDAQ NVDA has never managed to acquire a relevant market share in the mobile market moreover in the smartphone market its market share is around zero Its true that Tegra K and X have astonishing performing GPUs but the downside is the very high TDP Given that Nvidia decided to down Icera operations in its clear that the company has a very low impact on competitors sales Nvidia will probably concentrate on the automotive laptop and small PCs markets media players MediaTek MediaTek Inc is going to release nm HPM Helio X MT Octacore A which will power some devices from Sony Meizu HTC Elephone Xiaomi and LeTV while others will be announced in the coming months Some of these customers are gradually detaching from the Snapdragon platform and they are likely to continue the trend Given the production node it may not provide great efficiency but the price is compelling and the A architecture has intrinsic low power consumption MediaTek will also release Helio X by the end of Its a tricluster composed of xA xA high clock xA low clock with a nm HPM node technology Looking at some leaked benchmarks it looks like this SoC may provide performance comparable to other competitors and lower heat generation Even if performance benchmarks look reliable there is some skepticism about heat tests By the way this SoC is attracting more and more customers since it seems to power the new HTC A flagship smartphone according to leaked info Finally MediaTek will release Helio X in Q This SoC will be a tetracluster composed of xA xA low clock xA mid clock xA high clock and it will be produced with a nm FINFET node technology which will provide very high performances on par to Samsung Mongoose M It must be considered that Helio X and Helio X will be updated to the last ARM Mali GPU T like Samsung M If we consider that these SoCs will be provided with competitive ISPs modem and other specifics will likely see a very high competitiveness in the application processors market In such a scenario Qualcomm will probably lose additional market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I have already talked about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC in my previous article which states that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will provide more compelling Atom X SoCs in the next few months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also may release a Core M SoC designed for highend phablets in coming years in addition to the Atom Broxton platform powered by Goldmont architecture Goldmont will probably be aligned to the Kaby Lake development line and it will be provided with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Gen HD Graphics refresh This GPU architecture will provide a massive boost to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom performances and efficiency Atom Bay Trail and Cherry Trail development was very slow it has been left behind in comparison to desktop development Baseband integration has been delayed to This issue has been creating enormous problems to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>even if it has tried to surpass it by subsidies In any case SkylakeY Core M is being tested on phablets right now If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be successful in these tests we could enjoy big changes in the future mobile application processors panorama Talking of baseband chips I have already mentioned the LG partnership <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>looks to be also well set for G chips and it has a stake in Spreadtrum a company which could be useful to penetrate the Chinese market Baseband features will be directly integrated on Atom SoCs in in order to exploit nm and nm nodes Such integration will provide lower power consumption and more simple logic boards features that will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoC a lot more compelling As for the IntelApple relationship it looks like the first company could provide some new baseband chips to Apple starting from Such a partnership could directly hit Qualcomm business since Apple is one of its biggest customers Finally it must not be forgotten that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Samsung and TSMC will have similar node technologies for nm production but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will use a nm beol for the nm node instead of TSMC which will still use a nm beol In such a scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the right trump cards to really enter the market and partially steal Qualcomm market share in coming years The market is giving an evaluation premium to Qualcomm in comparison to its industry sector and one of its competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation This premium may not be justified given their fundamentals even if there is no relevant difference in revenue growth and operating margin other metrics favor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a lot Analysts forecast an average YoY revenue growth of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and for Qualcomm In addition Qualcomms pricetocash flow is hugely higher compared to Intels This is quite strange given that the high cash flow has been one of the most important positive metrics in Qualcomm analyses If we also consider that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will increase its mobile market share while Qualcomm will likely partially lose its own market share Qualcomms stock perceives a not justifiable premium of Qualcomm has announced that it will enter the UAV market with its Snapdragon The most positive market forecast predicts a hobby and commercial UAV market around billion within Even if Qualcomm will manage to replicate its smartphone market share it would obtain revenue income quite lower than billion in which simply cannot compensate the other threats I have already mentioned Moreover the UAV market will have to face the regulation issue because regulations will probably set hard restrictions that would eventually reduce UAV market potential revenues Qualcomm is probably moving toward difficult years in this second part of the decade Royalty share is decreasing and the correlated revenues will probably shrink in the coming years due to its relative weakness in the G and G portfolio Baseband and application processors segments are likely to go through difficult times due to the rising competitiveness of customers that are more and more willing to design their own SoCs and chips Big customers tend to diversify their supplies and that is what Samsung and Apple are already doing Qualcomm may be a shortbuy for a speculative action only if SD will be able to perform well without generating overheating issues and only if its adoption will be fairly good I cannot say the same for a longterm bet Qualcomms market valuation is clearly overvalued against similar companies primarily in comparison to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation Just starting from PS PE and pricetocash flow in relation to the projected revenues and earnings growth Qualcomms overvaluation looks glaring I think that the PS evaluation could revert in the coming years a PE multiple of X and a PS multiple of X look feasible given that Qualcomm could face continuous weakness in revenues and a possible reduction in profitability With such multiples Qualcomm would fall at least an additional within roughly while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would probably be able to increase its valuation about in the same period Intels plan could be realized only if the company will be able to attack the smartphone sector and if it will be able to exploit Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT renewed energy From my point of view stay away from Qualcomm in the long run or short it Get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>instead Editors Note This
