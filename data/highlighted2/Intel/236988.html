Reasons Why Gilead Is A Better Investment Than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>And Reasons Why It Is Not Gilead Sciences Inc NASDAQGILD Seeking Alpha Gilead and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are both very large B market cap companies Gilead and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>both have huge profits and cash flow Gilead NASDAQ GILD and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC are two very large tech companies one biotech and one computer tech Although they do not compete directly they do compete indirectly for investment dollars Both have many adherents here on SA and rightly so However there are many differences in their investment profiles and in this article I will attempt to outline some of them As can be seen in the following table GILD sales are growing rapidly thanks to their HepC drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni Although there are many who doubt GILD can maintain this rate or anywhere close to it in future years I think the total market for HepC cure is in excess of B and will grow for the next to years I outlined my reasons for this optimism in this article Buy Gilead HepC Market Is At Least Billion Over The Next Years At the current run rate GILD is looking at sales of at least B next year Intels sales for the last quarters has been anemic but they do have some new products in the pipeline that could restore sales growth but the timing is iffy at this point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is well known for its high GM usually above But GILDs is even higher than that at That means that even though Intels sales are greater than GILDs to Gileads incremental profit per sales dollar increase is much higher Not only is Gileads GM much higher than Intels its gets to that GM much quicker than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does When the FDA approves a product the product is fully developed and ready to go commercial in very short order Thats because part of the FDAs approval process includes manufacturing and even packaging So when the FDA says go GILD can fire up the manufacturing immediately and get it out the door Of course sales and marketing have to take place too but if you look at the ramp up in Sovaldi and Harvoni sales went from zero to B in about a year Intels products have a longer ramp up due to the complexities of manufacturing products with nanometer spacing For example predictions for Intels new d NAND drives are of bits in over in and full production in Also the huge CAPEX involved means higher depreciation and amortization charges per item in the early years thus lowering GM Intels business of manufacturing chips requires an immense amount of capital New factories or fabs cost in excess of B each with Samsungs latest entry to cost more than B by the time it starts production in And with new technology coming year after year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must spend big dollars on RD to keep ahead of its competitors Pharmaceuticals on the other hand are less capital intensive than the IC integrated circuit business although they do have more product failures than the IC companies do Even though Intels sales are greater than Gileads over the last quarters Gileads profits were much higher If sales increase at the same rate going forward Gileads lower costs will result in an ever increasing profit lead over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Gileads Free Cash Flow is much higher too As might be expected based upon the above tables FCF also shows up in Gileads favor Of course more FCF means potentially more dividends more acquisitions and more buybacks or all three at the discretion of management It is a bone of contention with Gilead shareholders that Mr Market apparently does not believe that the HepC market will provide GILD with increasing profits for years to come Many analysts in fact think and earnings will be lower than s Since SovaldiHarvoni have not really gotten sales up to speed in Japan most of Europe China and South America I think there are increasing profits coming for years Not to mention the ever increasing political pressure to cure more and more HepC patients And there is the issue of competition which I will cover later in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand is believed by many to be on the cusp of big sales and earnings gains over the next two years or so via Skylake processor upgrades D NAND and the new d Xpoint However if you look at analysts predictions there is not much to look for in and Consensus estimates for and are and respectively which if true probably means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is fully valued right now If you listen to GILD managements Investor presentations or conference calls they are a model of clarity conciseness and conservativism They tell you what happened what is going to happen and answer all questions in a professional manner <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management on the other hand seems to have ADD things come and go never to be mentioned again We have heard about smart bracelets drones Haiku TB D NAND drives and now on very short notice a game changing product D Xpoint that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has supposedly been working on for years What we havent heard about is the extent of the Byr plus contra revenue that was buried in the PC group last year Nor do we receive any meaningful information on how or when they will grow IoT a CAGR market beyond the current YTDs I have been critical of Intels management previously in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Time For Some New Management and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Conference Call Much Ado About Nothing I have also questioned Intels ability to exploit the IoT market I ntel Internet Of Things Will Not Provide Significant Sales For The Foreseeable Future Gileads HepC products are wasting assets Gileads HepC products are a cure not a palliative like most drugs At some point in the future all eligible HepC patients will be cured and Gilead will stop making profits on it And unlike Intels processors they will not be able to make a bigger faster stronger new generation product like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does every few years Thus HepC products are one and done the only question being how many future customers are there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has less competition than Gilead at least for the next few years In less than a year two competitive HepC products have been approved One Viekira Pak from AbbVie is currently being sold and represents about of the market Coming in is a new product from Merck GrazoprevirElbasvir which may take some more market share from Gilead And although Gilead is far ahead in research contracts and worldwide marketing other HepC products on the horizon may take some share away The question is how much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on the other hand has two nearmonopoly products in CPU chips for both the desktop and servers These products will provide enormous sales and profits for the next few years but longer term will certainly have competition from ARM designed CPUs used by Apple Samsung Microsoft and Google This articles time frame for real competition is probably too short but gives the essence of the ARM argument More Woes For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Chip Chip Chipping Away At Chipzilla <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has some new products in the early stage of production that might provide for rapid sales and profit increases in a year or two <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a JV Joint Venture with Micron to develop a new kind of D NAND and an even newer type of nonvolatile memory called D Xpoint If they are correct in their market estimate and they can deliver commercial volumes at full margin the profits will be considerable if not at Gileads HepC level The question is when will they be able to produce commercial volumes at full margin I would guess for D NAND and for D Xpoint Obviously the sooner the better Gilead and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are both great companies and deserve the praise they receive by advocates on SA and elsewhere But as the quote above implies giving up the good for the great is the best investment advice At this point in time I see Gilead as the best investment due to its huge margins and low PE combined with what I think is a B plus market My only suggestion for Gilead is to do an Apple and announce a B buyback over the next years They could easily pay for it out of free cash flow and reducing share count by rd would increase profit per share to at least probably much more and would ignite the stock price similar to what happened with Apple Then use the inflated stock price to buy a new product line like they did with Pharmasset Source Unless
