style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC in a strategic move has agreed to buy Altera NASDAQ ALTR for billion in a deal that will cut out another chipmaker The worlds largest chipmaker will pay a share in cash for the maker of programmable logic semiconductors That is a premium of over Alteras closing share price on May and from March the day before the possibility of a transaction was first reported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is seeking a way to mitigate slowing growth accompanied by rising costs and trying to defend its most profitable business Altera will become an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>business unit to facilitate continuity of existing and new customer sales and support The transaction is expected to be accretive to Intels nonGAAP EPS and free cash flow in the first year after close <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>intends to fund the acquisition which is expected to close within six to nine months with a combination of cash from the balance sheet and debt The strategic side of the transaction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been looking for growth beyond the struggling personalcomputer market which has been declining since it peaked in Altera chips are used in a variety of markets ranging from communications to consumer electronics Alteras devices can have their function updated even after they have been installed in enddevices While theyre sold in relatively small volumes programmable logic usually requires the latest in production technology because its some of the largest chips in the industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to find more customers outside of his own chip business for Intels factory network which is the most advanced in the industry Acquiring Altera may help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>defend and extend its most profitable business supplying server chips used in data centers While sales of semiconductors for PCs are declining as more consumers rely on tablets and smart phones to get online the data centers needed to churn out information and services for those mobile devices are driving orders for higherend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors and shoring up profitability Creating value takes more than acceptance of value maximization as the organizational objective All companies affirm to maximize value but that is not true The choice of value maximization as the corporate objective must be complemented by a corporate vision strategy and tactics that unite participants in the organization in its struggle for dominance in its competitive arena That is clearly the case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The financial economics side of the transaction We define a sustainable competitive advantage as the difference the performance spread between the return on capital and the cost of capital a difference correctly measured that is after transforming GAAP numbers into a rigorous computation of economic profit after deducting the full cost of capital and eliminating the accounting distortions The higher the performance spread the bigger the competitive advantage Also as a long term value investor you know that over time market value and intrinsic value converge A company with a positive performance spread that is a return on its capital greater than its cost of capital a necessary condition for market value creation will see it decreases to zero if it is not able to embark on a new strategic value increasing trajectory It is exactly what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to do in acquiring Altera Finally we need to recall that the value of any company ie the market value of total capital is composed of two parts the value of assets in place or the value of the current operations ie the discounted value of the current net operating profits plus the value of the future growth opportunities In the simplified approach that we use here this second part is just the result of subtracting the first part ie the value of assets in place from the market value of total capital The connection with the fundamental risk is simple The greater the market value of the total capital of the corporation is composed of the value of the current operations the less significant is the value of the most uncertain part of the total value ie the future growth opportunities Let us apply these principles to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Altera In the following analysis we will see how actually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>unlike Altera is on a wealth creating strategic trajectory using our proprietary data and our own valuation methodology based on the integration of the economics of strategy and the principles of modern corporate finance The performance spreads of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have declined steadily from in March to in March In the context of a very competitive industry having a positive spread is already an achievement and it reveals the competitive advantage possessed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>But the decline is there and it tells the urgent need to reinforce the strategic trajectory Its intrinsic value per share has oscillated around during this period with a maximum of in It is now At the current market price May of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is fairly valued Moreover its current operating value represents of the market value of its total capital implying that the future growth value the part of the value coming from the most risky part of the total valuation is only Altera performance spreads have for the same dates declined from to minus Its intrinsic value per share has followed the same drift declining steadily from to to date It means that the price of paid by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for Altera reveals a premium of over the most recent intrinsic value At the current market price May of Altera is over valued Moreover its current operating value represents of the market value of its total capital implying that the future growth value the part of the value coming from the most risky part of the total valuation is Invest or stay invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>This stock is a rocksolid choice for the very risk averse investor It will pay off gradually over the next several years Anyway new investors do not have to pay much for the value of the growth opportunities and they buy the value of the assets in place at a fair price Source <span
