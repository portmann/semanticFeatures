article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article At CES Intels CEO reviewed products that will form the basis for Intels next multibillion dollar business units The basic building blocks Curie Real Sense Skylake Windows Linex Xeon Phi The experiences sports health entertainment industrial arts The Consumer Electronics Show focuses on consumer products with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>adding its focus on experiences made possible by technology This article makes an attempt to put numbers and dollars to the experiences described by Brian Krzanich Please add your own thoughts in comments Brian Krzanichs keynote address was chalk full of great experiences with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>partner products that are either out now or will be out in The first time I watched the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>keynote address my thought wondered to how is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>going to make money from these experiences This article focuses on an attempt to put numbers and dollars to the experiences <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shared I know a lot of you will attempt to put these experiences into existing business units and they will likely end up in existing units But I dont go there for sake of discussion in this article I believe the switch to experiences has three basic reasons CES is a consumeroriented show and consumers love amazing experiences <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants people to think of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a company that makes amazing experiences possible not just a PC company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants the next generation of makers to turn to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for the tech needed to provide consumers amazing experiences Many experiences were shared in the Keynote address This was not an exhaustive review of all the experiences <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>foresees Its a sample of the experiences that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is creating For example automotive is a big area that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did not mention in the keynote but in an interview at CES Brian talked about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>projects in the works to meet the needs of the automotive industry based on the same foundation of tech products Here is just a sampling of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reviewed during the keynote Understanding these experiences is best done watching the video Full stadium D modeling Video from cameras placed around a stadium is stitched together to create a full D model of the action Networks can show replays from virtually any position in the stadium This takes a tremendous amount of computing power provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In addition Skylake processors can have access to this so that an individual can create their own replays at their PC Eventually as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processing ability reaches mobile phones this type of replay can be done on a mobile phone Game stats Curie placed on snowboards BMX bikes etc at XGames to allow networks to show statistics real time of how fast how high rotations Gforces etc Curie placed in sports shoes Curie soon getting power from movement no battery to recharge Drones and robots Drones and robots using Curie Real Sense and Skylake for autonomous movement and producing tons of data to be analyzed in data centers Personal Trainer Curie in sunglasses providing real time statistics about pace impacts heart beat etc all using voice commands Then the processor communicates information and suggestions verbally for changes to the workout to achieve appropriate goals Hard helmets one of my favorites Im a civil engineer A helmet that not only protects your head but sees in D and can provide diagnostic information heatvibration levels above normal repair procedures operating procedures all hands free with verbal commands and projection on the protective lens attached to the helmet Fireworks without fireworks Hundreds of drones with light emitters forming D shapes in the sky moving in sync with music Endless possibilities No smoke or other pollution Dancers making their own music Curie attached to hands feet and fingers An air guitar that actually produces music These numbers and dollars are intended to provide a feel for the numbers and dollars and how these experiences can translate to meaningful revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The numbers and dollars are my best guesses You can insert your own guesses Curie Chips Hundreds of millions at each Billions of dollars Real Sense Tens of millions at each Billions of dollars Skylake Processors Millions at each Billions of dollars Zeon Phi Hundreds of thousands at each Billions of dollars These experiences can create billions of dollars in revenue and at Intels gross margin and tax rates can produce another billion dollars in earnings per year increasing current earnings by a third Such an increase in earnings would propel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock to over a share Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
