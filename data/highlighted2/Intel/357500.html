Alpha Intels recent Cloud Day focused on making Cloud deployment easier Intels Xeon and SSD announcements are good news but not great news Cloud Day points to slower DCG sales for the first half of likely a high singledigit increase and not enough to offset declining traditional server and PC sales Intels NASDAQ INTC Cloud Day highlighted the efforts and products the company is implementing to make Cloud deployment easier A few points made during the event Public private and hybrid cloud deployments are all part of the future NonSuper cloud growth is twice the rate of growth of the Super Endtoend security is now part of the client expectation New SSDs include the first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>D NAND SSD Sales of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SSDs for data center use has doubled over the last two years New Xeon processors provide improved efficiency and security SDI Software Defined Infrastructure open software stack is now providing X improved efficiency with better prioritization of tasks and better security My sense is the Cloud market is showing signs of maturing The focus for the day was not on wonderful new products or approaches It was on technical improvements that make the Cloud somewhat better and somewhat easier to implement With maturing usually comes slower growth with more improvements in software than in hardware <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is relying heavily on Jevons Paradox technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used reducing the amount necessary for any one use but the rate of consumption of that resource rises because of increasing demand The Cloud dramatically improves the efficiency of processors with huge increases in utilization rates in some cases from utilization to plus These improved utilization rates without increases in demand for computing would be devastating to a hardware supplier like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>We are likely at a transition where the efficiency of the Cloud has improved dramatically but the overall rate of consumption has not yet kicked into overdrive due to increased demand caused by improved efficiency This transition to the next stage of Jevons Paradox is likely a plateau resulting in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Cloud sales growth in the lower end of their outlook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to make Cloud deployment easier focus of Cloud Day Data collection needs to move from information provided by people to information provided by IoT and various video devices More mainstream use of video including D video analysis think beyond facial recognition to object recognition Full encryption of all data going into the Cloud Integrating HPC High Performance Computing into the Cloud <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working on all of these items and more to increase demand for Cloud computing These necessary steps to increasing demand for Cloud computing are having an impact on the demand for Cloud computing However the large increases in Cloud demand necessary to achieve CAGR growth in Intels DCG sales has not yet been seen I see these items kicking in to significantly increase demand for Cloud computing in and The industry is taking longer than expected to implement these initial stages of IoT and D video analytics This timing is part of the reason for my previous conclusion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will slump in and thrive In Based on past records and the lack of any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>midquarter adjustment to these numbers I fully expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings to be within these ranges However given the continued decline in PC sales and slower than expected DCG sales growth I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings to be below the midpoint of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provided outlook Part of this decline in PC sales and slower than expected growth in DCG sales is due to the weak worldwide economy and part to slower than expected implementation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products These two factors have increased the Osborne effect where buyers tend to hold back on purchases and delay purchases waiting for the next and better level of technology The chart below shows the recent rise in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock value essentially following the general rise in the stock market since February to It also shows the lows at around reached in May and more recently in August Overall this chart indicates weakening stock market confidence in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since December The chart below shows the longer term view of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price The top declining line indicates weakening overall confidence in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>revenues and earnings The three bottom lines indicate flat or rising confidence in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>future prospects despite lower near term earnings results and suggest a floor of to This chart also confirms that a convergence is likely in the late and time period where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will either show it is worthy of breaking out above or that it has failed to implement its turnaround programs CloudNFV memory and IoT and will fall below I expect drops to into the to range over the next six months to be shortlived after April and June earnings below midpoint of Intels outlook and represent a good buying opportunity unless the world economy takes a turn for the worse I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions
