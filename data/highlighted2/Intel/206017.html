YORK As a veteran of the global smart phone wars AppleAAPLO is used to courtroom battles with fierce competitors such as SamsungKS and NokiaNOKIAHE This week however a federal jury returned a verdict against Apple in a lawsuit brought by a different kind of adversary a public university The University of WisconsinMadisons licensing arm the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation convinced a jury that Apple had infringed its patent for improving chip efficiency when the company incorporated the technology into some of its phones and tablets Research institutions and universities have not traditionally been major players in patent litigation and even now schools still launch relatively few patent suits compared to private companies about to cases per year according to preliminary research by University of Alberta professor Tania Bubela But within that world WARF has become an aggressive litigator Since the foundation has filed lawsuits against different defendants according to a Reuters analysis of federal court data maintained by RPX Corp a patent risk management firm In the current case WARF is claiming million in damages from Apple As the dispute over how much the iPhone maker owes is hashed out critics are questioning whether schools receiving public money for research should be engaged in hostile patent litigation WARF however has argued that such lawsuits are key to monetizing inventions created at research universities and that protecting patents encourages innovation The Apple trial is now in the damages phase and if WARF gets anywhere close to what it is asking it would be one of the largest patent payouts ever to a university Attorney Michael Ng who has represented Australias national science agency in US courts said that universities are feeling forced into litigation In recent years there has been a greater reluctance for example in hightech to do voluntary licensing deals and that sometimes leaves holders of intellectual property with no other recourse In its current lawsuit WARF hired one of the countrys top patent litigators Morgan Chu to go headtohead with Apple attorney William Lee And last month WARF sued Apple again over the same patent this time targeting the companys newest products the iPhone S and S Plus and iPad Pro WARF also sued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp in but the case was settled the following year on the eve of trial WARF housed on the universitys Madison campus has been around for years and helps patent and commercialize the universitys inventions In alone it provided more than million in direct and inkind support to the university it said WARF declined to provide any of its staff to be interviewed for this article citing the ongoing trial Apple also declined to comment The patent at issue in the Apple suit was granted in and covered a predictor circuit to boost microchip performance developed by a computer science professor Gurindar Sohi and three of his students Sohi declined to comment In the years leading up to the invention Sohis research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research which provided about annually according to court documents In he and another professor also received a million grant over three years from the NSF and the Advanced Research Projects Agency All three of those agencies are credited in the patent itself which notes The United States has certain rights in this invention Some legal experts have criticized lawsuits over patents developed with public funding Government funding is being used to go after some of our most innovative companies said Robin Feldman a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law Do we want taxpayer money to fund this behavior Though universities are legally able to obtain patents considered a private right on research funded by public dollars This policy is being turned on its head she said But WARF has argued in the past as it did to the Federal Trade Commission in that companies that infringe on university patents should have to pay monetary damages Such penalties the foundation says encourage companies to license patents providing revenues on which universities depend on to create startups and commercialize their inventions In short strong patents and a high cost for infringement stimulate innovation its
