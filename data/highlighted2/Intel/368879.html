business according to Wall Street analysts in large part because the telecommunications companys efforts to become a force in Internet content have gone relatively well under the leadership of AOL Inc Chief Executive Tim Armstrong Verizon acquired AOL last June for billion its first big foray into the advertisingsupported Internet business and it is not yet clear how well the unit is performing financially Subsequent moves including the takeover of much of Microsoft Corps MSFTO advertising technology business a deal to buy Millennial Media for about million and the recent launch of the mobile video service go are also too recent to assess Yet analysts have given the big phone company high marks for allowing AOL to operate independently and folding in other recent acquisitions without much drama And they said Armstrong seems to be driving Verizons recent moves in go and recent acquisitions The management puts a lot of faith in Armstrong BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk said That faith derives in part from the belief that Armstrong did a good job at leftfordead AOL especially in assembling a strong set of products to deliver targeted digital ads to customers Combining AOL and Yahoo an idea that has come up many times over the years could instantly make Yahoo a major player in Internet advertising with Armstrong one of the worlds top ad executives at the helm analysts said Armstrong has good MA experience and a pretty solid ad tech stack B Riley Co analyst Sameet Sinha said Verizons handsoff approach that has worked with AOL though might not be suitable if the farbigger Yahoo were taken over With Yahoos struggling business the luxury of autonomy is simply not there Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said Verizon showed interest in Yahoos core business as early as December when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would see if there is a strategic fit for Yahoos holdings which include mail news sports and advertising technology Yahoo under pressure from activist investors launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABAN The first round of bidding is slated for next week and Verizon plans to make a bid sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its adsupported

user interests and tastes that powers its rivals in online ads chiefly Alphabet Incs GOOGLO Google and Facebook Inc FBO Armstrong who made his name leading sales at Google is highly regarded in the advertising community in contrast to Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer another former Google highflyer who has been struggling to revive Yahoo Mayer would likely leave after a VerizonYahoo deal analysts said Verizon is not especially interested in Yahoos massive stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan Corp T which are worth far more than its core internet business the sources said That could leave an opening for a bidder such as Softbank Group T Yahoos partner in Yahoo Japan which might be able to devise a way to minimize the tax bill that would come with any sale of the Asia investments Yahoo is ultimately Verizons to lose said Robert Peck Internet analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Theyre the leading candidate in this effort and can afford to pay the most because of cost synergies and scale Other players weighing joint or solo bids are media company Time Inc TIMEN and several private equity firms including Blackstone Group LP BXN and KKR Co LP KKRN according to sources The owner of
