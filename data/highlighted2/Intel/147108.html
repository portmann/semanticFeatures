economic recovery by the mainstream media Imagine running a rink company at the end of the roller skating fad in the s You know it is not going to survive for long How do you operate your business You milk it Well thats now Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site This is just a quickhitter post on another former leader that is breaking down As we have mentioned several times in particular on July and August the everthinning stock market rally is starting to lose the relatively few leaders still keeping it afloat That July post noted the relative weakness in the equalweight Nasdaq even as the capweighted index remained near its highs One reason was the performance of Apple Inc AAPL the largest stock in the index and the entire US market When AAPL is moving higher it can mask a lot of problems in the broader market Unfortunately for bulls AAPL is beginning to crack It began on the day of the July post when it got crushed following its earnings release It has since broken down more recently dropping below its post UP trendline As the chart indicates we are using a logarithmic scale AAPL prices held the trendline in and but broke below just last week Yesterday the stock tried to retake the trendline but it failed miserably losing over today For a market reasonably close to its week high that has exhibited an almost unprecedented deterioration in breadth it can illafford to lose the few leaders it has left especially one rotten apple that just so happens to be the largest stock in the world Wed Takeaction Wed Dr Engali Funny how a company starts to break down after it bends to Wall Streets will and takes on a bunch of debt just to repurchase shares at an inflated price so Wall Street can get out Maybe apple should focus on RD instead of social engineering and bending to the street Wed JRobby Guessing skipping rent and car payments to get the latest over priced Apple gadget is no longer part of the consumer behavior playbook Wed Bu This is awesome I laugh at all the Apple lemmings AAPL was a great company with Steve Jobs but he is gone and the current CEO is nothing compared with Jobs Its a music playing breast implant developed after market research found women were tired of men just staring at their tits and not listening to them Wed Temerity Trader One company One fing company and the fate of the entire fing financial world is totally dependent upon the number of IToys they sell Unreal Fundies big banks of all investors piling into AAPL all gonna get rich as the stock goes to infinity and beyond How goes Apple so goes the markets and the entire world A really sad commentary on humanitytotally driven by greed But get them fearful and they will run like rats leaving a sinking ship The Fed bankers know all this and that is why it is so important to talk happy talk all the time Economic recovery is strong thanks to our QE We are your heroes We saved all you little peoplebuy stocks Warren is There is no way out of this Demand was driven forward again by loose credit The lemmings obeyed and borrowed and bought crap from China Finally they are all tapped out and the plunge begins again Millions of immigrants will accelerate the final collapse not help prevent it We are Greece just a few years or months behind it Free healthcare for all Including illegals Entitlements galore Come get your EBT cards Why work Wouldnt that lower the cost of every thing it sells outside of China andhave little impact on the stuff it both makes and sells in China
