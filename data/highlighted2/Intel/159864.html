during testing At the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>anticipated Silicon Photonics reentering the market in late Along with many others I was disappointed with the delays to Silicon Photonics but it is better to do it right than go forward with a product that has issues especially in data centers where reliability and reputation are key think six nines of reliability Over the last nine months with a new Silicon Photonics manager from outside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has improved upon their Silicon Photonics product and is now touting it as a cost effective replacement for fiber optics in much of the data center to increase communication speeds around and between data centers In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is working on improvements to Silicon Photonics that will allow it to cost effectively replace more fiber optics as well as copper in the data center with faster communication speeds With data centers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has increased the processing speed so much with Moores Law that recently storage and connectivity have become constraints Intels introduction of D XPoint helps reduce the storage constraint and now Silicon Photonics helps to reduce the connectivity constraint At the recent IDF I had a great conversation with a systems person from Facebook NASDAQ FB He described having hundreds of thousands of processor units in Facebook data centers More data is sent across a single mega data center than across the entire World Wide Web Obviously a three meter long high speed meter connection is a constraint A twokilometer Silicon Photonics cable with the same speed increases flexibility and throughput significantly Silicon Photonics provides the data center with faster denser and longer reach connectivity Imagine the Facebook data center below in North Carolina filled with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon server units not reaching their full potential due to constraints associated with connectivity Silicon Photonics is a Key Enabler in the Transformation of Data Centers At one time fiber optics was thought to be the end all for communications Now fiber optics is a constraint in the data center Silicon Photonics takes what was previously performed in fiber optics modems and allows direct connections between silicon Lithography is used to define lasers right on the silcon This provides a huge advantage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in future scaling of Silicon Photonics to smaller and smaller sizes producing higher and higher bandwidth and faster and faster speeds The constraint associated with fiber optics is being replaced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with the faster more dense and longer reaching Silicon Photonics The current connectivity constraints require a hierarchy of connections where a bank of processors racks communicates with two levels a set of supervisory processors leaf and spine which then communicate with a mother of all processors the core For one processor to communicate with another it must go through the leaf through the spine to the core and then back through the spine through the leaf and back to the rack Each connection slows latency and uses power Silicon Photonics allows one level of supervisory computers to handle all communications without first going through a leaf or checking in with the data center core Eliminating these two layers improves network throughput significantly while descreasing power use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be connecting CPUs and switches
