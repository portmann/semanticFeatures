pricey MacBooksMacs Not every enterprise client will be able to afford the Surface BookSurface Pro HPs cheaper in tabletnotebooks are good alternatives to the Microsoft Surface laptops Tim Cook himself made it very clear that Apple NASDAQ AAPL will never createsell a converged MaciPad computer product This decision should help HP NYSE HPQ further improve its sales of highend laptops to enterprise users and creative professionals Investors should care that Cooks dismissive attitude toward touchscreenfriendly computers creates a big opportunity for HPs latest in tabletnotebook products The recalcitrant policy of Apple to only sell MacBooks with no touchscreen displays means the HP Spectre could render the MacBook Air less attractive among business users The affordable price tag of the Spectre comes with free detachable keyboard and LTE wireless connectivity makes it a perfect threat to the inch MacBook Air Unlike Apples latest Ultrabook the Spectre has a touchscreen display and it could also be used as standalone tablet Cook was also wrong to claim that the iPad Pro could replace Windows PCs Various handson reviews already proved that the current ARMbased iPad Pro is not yet a legit laptop replacement The iPad Pros lack of compatibility with industry standard xonly software means it is an inferior product that enterprise users will likely ignore The previous popularity of the MacBook Air helped Apple become the top seller of Ultrabook or smallerscreen laptops However the need to buy a separate MacBook and an iPad Pro to match the versatility of a Windows hybrid tabletUltrabook is a important issue for budgetconscious enterprise customers The significant cost savings from buying HPs in laptops is something that all IT managers would like to take advantage of The cheaper Spectre could attract business users who realize that the cheapest Surface Pro with no keyboard actually has the same hardware specs of the keyboardequipped Spectre My point is that HP has a great opportunity to not only win business clients away from Apple but also from Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Not every corporate IT manager will willingly accede to the high price tags of the Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Book in laptops Besides HP has decadeslong of experience supplying laptops to corporate customers If and when a company should decide to replace their old MacBooks it will be more costeffective to buy the Spectre instead of the Surface Pro HPs move to sign up to sell Microsoft Surface products was only a token gesture HP will prioritize selling its own Windows computers because HP could preinstall its own software Yes Microsoft will pay a commission for every Surface computer that HP sells However I doubt if Microsoft will allow HP to preinstall its commercial enterprise software products on the Surface Pro or Surface Book Like Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY I believe HP also knows that Microsofts ambition to become a PC vendor makes it a rising rival that should not get any help HP also sells topend Windows workstations to attract designers video editors and CAD artists HPs Mac To Z campaign has been going on for many years now It aims to convert Mac Pro users to switch to the more costeffective and more powerful HP Z Workstation computers The focus on creating Mac Prolevel workstations helped HP become the leader market share in desktop workstation sales HPs closed collaboration with leading software vendors like Adobe NASDAQ ADBE and Autodesk NASDAQ ADSK likely helped it optimize the Z Workstation computers to win the attention of demanding creative professionals HPs cheaper alternatives to the Mac Pro also comes with an onsite year warranty while the Mac Pro comes with a year warranty It means HP builds topquality workstations that are absolutely worthy of multiyear highcompute abuse The latest ZBook Workstation laptops are now also ready to encroach on the sector that the MacBook Pro now reigns over Upgrading the Mac to Z campaign to attack the top laptop of Apple is a shrewd move The more affordable Windows basic ZBook u again comes with a touchscreen display I opine that the HP ZBook u is a smart replacement for the MacBook Pro Creative industry professionals will not only save a great amount of money buying Wintel HP Workstation computers they also have the option of running Mac OS X El Capitan on them Yes HP sells its Workstations with preinstalled Windows or Linux operating systems However its an open secret that many techsavvy buyers now buy cheaper Wintel workstations like the HP Z to create a hackintosh This is something that investors should take into account Apples decision to optimize its desktop operating system for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC x processors made it easy to create cheaper hackintosh versions of the Mac Pro and MacBook Pros HPQ is a Buy HPs longterm highend PC business benefits from Apples refusal to release a touchenabled or a in Mac The bigspending customers of Mac computers will not remain loyal forever HP should exploit Tim Cooks blunder and really go after those Mac customers who are already dissatisfied with their Mac laptops and desktop computers A strong focus on competing against the highmargin Mac and iPad Pro in the enterprisecreative market is better for HPs bottom line Let Lenovo reign as the top global PC vendor with its focus on lowcost computers HP will only suffer if it tries to match the bottompricing strategy of a Chinese PC vendor Lastly HP has decadeslong track record of supplying reliable enterprisecentric laptops and workstations This is something Microsoft cannot yet claim Yes the Surface Pro was a trendsetting product last year that is winning the wallets of business users However I
