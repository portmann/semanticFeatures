Time To Sell Or Yes Even Short Facebook Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebooks current billion valuation is not cheap Buy low and sell high applies now history has taught us that lesson often Never in my tenure of writing articles on Seeking Alpha have I been attacked more than for my last article when I suggested that the Facebook NASDAQ FB goal of billion users by may be unattainable despite using conservative metrics in my assumptions For that reason I decided to re examine my thesis As a result of this reevaluation I have concluded that my original thesis was not only accurate but if anything too conservative Now I am going to be the first to acknowledge that anyone who has held FB stock has done very well Too many people who own the stock in its very short history of being a public company claim that Facebook is just starting to ramp up and things will never go bad History suggests otherwise and I will delve into that later But for now let us focus on the billion valuation that has priced perfection into the stock price Those who have bought FB stock have indeed done very well Good for them Investing however is about the future and preservation of capital as much as it is about how well a stock has served you in the past With that being said Im going to once again start by discussing FB trends the expectation of billion users by and finally what history suggests will happen to Facebook Below are the Facebook trends for the past five years While exhibiting growth that has indeed made shareholders very happy in the past one needs to review the data and ask if this growth which the company themselves acknowledges is going to slow down will lend itself to a market capitalization much above the current billion The company itself has acknowledged that growth has and will slow down From page of the annual report We expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and we achieve greater market penetration It would not be unrealistic given the companys own admission of trends slowing down to expect the following growth rates in the next three years While these growth numbers still indicate future growth it is a hard argument to justify assigning these numbers to a company with a billion market cap that is priced for perfect execution going forward Additionally with China and India currently countries that Facebook is not allowed in future growth is severely curtailed unless either of these countries reverses their decision and allows Facebook within their borders In the case of China RenRen Tencent OTCPKTCEHY which owns the qq messaging service and WeChat are all firmly entrenched All have well established footprints with a total of over million monthly users Sina Weibo is another Chinese site that is similar to Twitter Even if Facebook is eventually allowed in China they face a steep uphill battle to gain any significant market share The competition they face is unlike any they have seen before FB has become successful by creating user engagement They are not a company that fights and wins their users in markets that are already well established In India the decision to reject Facebook is a recent one and centers around questions pertaining to internetorg Specifically India blocked Facebook because they claimed that FBs plans are illegal plans that violate net neutrality Once again there are already many companies trying to divide up the social media platform and associated services in India Among them are Simplify simplifycom Germin germincom and BlueOcean blueoceanmicom Also of concern are countries where is already a firm Facebook footprint Some such as Germany are starting to question Facebooks tactics Just this past week as reported in a CNN article Germany raised concerns about the privacy of Facebook users and opened an antitrust probe To be fair I should mention that Instagram Messenger WhatsApp and Oculus are still growing rapidly The core Facebook service however is the largest and oldest The challenges of growing the user base maximizing advertising and income generation as well as minimizing account closures are challenges that all subsidiaries will face in the future Past growth and success are no guarantee of future success The current stage of Facebooks growth has them at an allimportant crossroads Will the growth continue That question is why the rest of the world matters The market penetration of the United Sates is quickly reaching a cap The majority of those in the United States that want to be on Facebook have already signed up As discussed in my prior article Mark Zuckerberg has mentioned that his vision for Facebook is to have billion users by It has been suggested by some that I do not use this metric because Mr Zuckerbergs comment may not have been serious or he may have simply been blowing off steam It has been quite some time since the comment was made however and there has been no refutation or rebuttal to the comment by Mr Zuckerberg so I tend to think that the comment was genuine and truly reflected a belief he has for Facebooks growth Regardless of if Mr Zuckerberg was serious or not it is important to analyze how much possible growth lies ahead for Facebook Here is a recapanalysis of how that is more than likely unachievable All world population data is extracted from United States Census Bureau data As mentioned earlier Facebook is currently blocked in China and just recently in India as well As a result of that the population estimates to evaluate the feasibility of Facebooks billion user claim do not include those two countries In Facebook had monthly active users which translates to of the worlds current population To achieve billion users Facebook would need to register of the worlds population of all ages in all other countries But lets not forget that not all of the world population is computer literate old enough to use a computer or even has a computer or smartphone In reality in there will be almost billion people under and over billion under years of age and million over years of age From that number we dismiss half of them of which live in India or China and another a very conservative number for being computer illiterate or not having computer access that means we are still excluding another million people from the base of potential Facebook users As a result we need to reduce the worldwide population able to use Facebook by said million resulting in a new total of billion possible Facebook users So the question arises How can Facebook sign up billion users if the universe of possible users is only billion The scenario of billion users is impossible to achieve My last and favorite argument revolves around the lessons that history has taught us These are lessons that Facebook investors refuse to acknowledge Investors always look to the past to gain a possible edge on what may transpire in the future for their investments All companies Im using are high technology companies that were once industry leaders sound familiar This is not an apples to oranges comparison Im going to concentrate on what has transpired over the years with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY All are in the technology fields and have to one degree or another had an impact on what has made Facebook the powerhouse that it is today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made the chips that every computer uses There will always be a demand and with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>being flush with cash it was the undisputed semiconductor chip maker No one would ever be able to overtake them right Sixteen years after the companys August share price of shareholders are watching shares trade hands for as I write this article That is down from the all time high That is despite having a lower valuation than FB a PE of vs FBs PE of and having stellar yearoveryear earnings growth Yahoo used to be the dominant search engine Coupled with their email and message boards they were a social media company before social media companies were known No one could ever compete with them right Sixteen years after the companys per share valuation investors watching shares change hands at as I write this article which is down from the alltime highs despite having revenue growth that was exceeding FB Earnings also began flowing for the first time There was nothing that could stop Yahoo right Someone forgot to tell that to Google My favorite history example is BlackBerry Remember when BlackBerry was the best smartphone on the market No one ever imagined Apple would be the force that they are sound familiar The stock went from May s to the current as I write this article which represents a decline of despite having revenue growth that makes Facebook look like a rookie still playing ball in the minor leagues with only aspirations of ever making the big leagues History teaches us valuable lessons but we need to be open to accepting and acting on these learnings Facebook has been a terrific growth company and investment Current trend analysis however suggests that the companys self acknowledged slowdown in user growth trends will translate into a company that cannot support a share price and billion market capitalization let alone an even a significantly higher valuation expected by the minions At current levels Facebook cannot be recommended as a buy or hold Therefore a sell or short would be the only logical conclusion Also before the question is asked Im not currently short FB I only play the long side of the equities markets This article is intended to express my views that FB is no longer an appealing longterm purchase I personally do not have not and likely never will short FB or any other stock Disclaimer Investing in stocks such as Facebook can be risky There is no guarantee that your investment will be safe There is also a great likelihood that you may lose some or all of your investment This is particularly important when considering the shorting or any stock Please do
