#A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron IMFT concentrating on NAND and nonvolatile memories has been doing well and is about to explode in the best sense of the word August has a number of key dates for this JV and its technologies Wall Streets sellside analysts are too busy looking at the wings on the fly on their windshields They arent looking down the road at the big picture when it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron Technology NASDAQ MU They are concerned about the death of the PC the tax rate and inventories in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>They are concerned with a supposed Chinese bid the death of the PC and a Samsung yettobebuilt fab in the case of Micron One key area they are not currently writing about is one of the biggest nearterm profit and revenue drivers D NAND and SSDs built on this technology coming out of the IM Flash Technologies joint venture between the two companies Refresher Course How big is this SSD thing Many will remember that these beans were spilled by Rob Crooke at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Day on November I dont remember a single Wall Street analyst report which focused on this crystal clear road sign in blazing neon Heres slide from that Investor Day As slideware investordayspeak goes this is pretty good the star is November and they show us this market will be penetrated by But the real beef is in Crookes remarks at about minute There he states that the SSD industry has grown from in to billion in and is only penetrated Lets see billion billion total addressable market And what has IMFT done differently Brian M Krzanich <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Chief Executive Officer reminded us there was something different in the IMFT recipe in these remarks from their recent earnings call D NAND is looking quite good From cost yield and performance I dont think weve gone public with much of those numbers right now But what we have said is that D NAND especially with the architectural choices that Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chose we believe gives a significant cost and performance advantage over their competitors and those specifics are holding as we go through the ramp process Authors emphasis added We know one main architectural difference is IntelMicrons adoption of a time tested floating gate technology vs the charge trap selected by Samsung OTCSSNLF and SanDiskToshiba And while there are many devotees of the chargetrap approach I think I will line up with Brian Krzanich CEO of the largest chip company in the world Micron and SAs own Russ Fischer all favoring the floating gate approach We wont know the results of this battle for quite a while and need to have IMFT floating gate parts in the wild which can be benchmarked and beat up This will be a tech battle and press release frenzy that will out do the Edison vs Tesla DC vs AC Betamax vs VHS TDMA vs CDMA battles of yesteryear Heres Russ on charge trap vs floating gate Heres where it gets a little interesting We know that the four D NAND suppliers are using different approaches to the technology The biggest difference is that IntelMicron picked floating gate as the storage element while Samsung and apparently everyone else chose a charge trap technology which is an easier technology to implement in a D structure In recent analyst presentations by Micron management there have been hints that not all is well with the charge trap technology used or planned to be used by everyone but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron In a recent Jefferies presentation Kipp Bedard VP of Investor Relations mentioned that the Samsung charge trap is so leaky that a thumb drive full of pictures stored in a desk drawer might come up blank in six months You can listen for yourself here at about minute Now Kipp has been around this business since Christ was a corporal and isnt likely to throw this kind of stuff out unless its true because payback is really tough What are the mileposts for which we should watch August is going to be a terribly busy month and we are likely to get a whole lot more than a peek at what is going on with IMFTs D NAND and new nonvolatile memory Flash Memory Summit Ill bet the talk by Darren Thomas Micron Analyst Day Im betting that Micron is about ready to hand some good news to their shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Developer Forum I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will tell us why they have added persistent memory instructions like CLWB and PCOMMIT I bet we see something new on persistent memory United States Bankruptcy Court hearing in re Energy Conversion Devices In his excellent article and comments thereto Stephen Breezy makes the case that the ultimate resolution of the Energy Conversion Devices bankruptcy is critical to the rollout of PCM or phase change memory This oft delayed case has a critical hearing on closing the case scheduled Conclusions The SSD opportunity will grow from billion in to billion in per the remarks of Rob Crooke cited above Let me go way out on a limb here and theorize that the IntelMicron approach will prove to be significantly better than Samsungs which are already having problems with heat and random erasures in existing SSDs and may be lagging in D density I believe there is a chance IMFT could secure half of the market when it is penetrated in Onefourth to Micron for an additional billion in revenue Onefourth to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for an additional billion in revenue Make that billion each when the market
