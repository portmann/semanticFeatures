from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to fail to gain traction in high growth markets Intels server dominance appears unassailable in the near future and the market should continue to grow The PC market will get more challenging for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with no catalyst for market growth and emerging competition from AMD was yet another year where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC was unable to show growth with success in some areas offset by deficiencies in others Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continued to dominate important markets those markets regressed I have been ambivalent about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for quite some time as past articles indicate and the stock price has remained pretty steady during that time The company is so large its easy to find success and failure in different segments and those segments have remained largely the same for the past few years Having listened to Intels technology conference I was very disappointed in the leadership and the lack of candor and realism in the remarks given by it The company even went so far as to say Skylake was the largest processor jump in the companys history In fact its a relatively minor upgrade and does not even approximate the generational jumps in processors up to the Pentium Pro release in This was just one of many comments that put me off I remain very pessimistic about management which I hope is understandable given the inability over the past decade to effectively benefit from new growth markets As we look at the Q revenue we see not only a yeartoyear drop on a quarterly basis but also a drop for the first nine months of the year With the cost of sales up gross margins naturally fell The Client Computing group was largely responsible for this decline but the larger problem is that the Internet of Things group did not grow and this was considered a vital growth area The reality is this market is just not there yet and without standardization it is not clear when or if this market will grow and who the winners will be ifwhen it does I do believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has good products in this market as I have covered in past articles but this does not guarantee success I was expecting better from this group The Data Center group grew but only about which is significantly lower than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had projected With the client markets including smartphones doing significantly worse than expected I do not view this unfavorably All things considered its doing quite well and it should also benefit from the new products based on the nm process more than the PC market so believe this could become even stronger for the company Naturally competition will be ramping but its very difficult to see anything meaningful in If we look at the biggest threats to Intels dominance in servers it comes from ARM NASDAQ ARMH based solutions IBMs NYSE IBM POWER and OpenPOWER and AMDs NASDAQ AMD upcoming x solutions One only needs to look at AMDs deemphasis of the ARMbased K as well as the Seattle platform to get a clear indication of where ARM is with regards to servers ARM may one day represent a real threat to x in this market but that day is not today and not tomorrow Given how long it takes to develop both hardware and software platforms as well the very slow pace of adopting new platforms by server customers ARM will not have serious market share this decade Anything else is wishful thinking and unrealistic IBM represents a more real threat but even here this platform is not ready There is no question IBM makes extremely powerful and capable machines exceeding even those made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but these carry a price tag which largely prevent them from gaining significant market share OpenPOWER does attempt to address this and has the backing of very capable companies but it is still developing products and is currently severely limited in scope compared to the x market It is certainly further ahead than ARM With IBMs unquestionable expertise in this type of technology in both hardware and software it could represent a threat before the turn of this decade However considering where it is now and how long it takes to adopt new technology in servers its very difficult to see this taking significant market share from x in the next year or two Which leaves AMD and the Zen architecture AMD does know how to make server parts excellent GPUs and very good lowend processors Its not as clear the company knows how to make a competitive highend processor and has not in quite some time Although AMD has gained some overall PC market share in Q and in commercial products its important to note that both were quite minor and both markets are much more price sensitive than the server market This has left AMD with of the server market as price reductions are generally ineffective and there is little AMD can do to materially increase market share with the current product offerings We should also note that Zen will initially be targeting the PC market and only later the server market Again we have to consider the slow pace of adoption even considering Zen will use the same instruction set as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>products and theres very little chance of AMD gaining significant market share in or Whether it can later on will depend largely on how well it can compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>server chips and its far from obvious that it will show competitive characteristics Ill reiterate pricing will not remedy a technological deficiency in server parts like it can in the PC market So I do not see the Data Center Group having any real competition near term and believe it will continue to be a driver of growth The market itself should continue to grow Although data consumption may not be growing as fast as it was it is still growing Furthermore the move to nm will give newer processors favorable power characteristics visavis older ones which could stimulate replacement cycles When we look at the Client Computing Group we see a different situation This group includes the PC market tablet market and the phone market which makes seeing specific numbers for each quite difficult No doubt this is intentional as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management likes to cover up problem areas with inappropriate groupings like this After all what do lowcost phones and the PC market have to do with each other If you answer they share in some cases the same architecture one only needs to look at the Data Center Group to see that this applies even more with respect to the PC market Although the SilvermontAirmont architecture could never be confused with an excellent one Intels wide breadth of supporting technologies still give it a good chance in the low end phone market as the SoFIA platform gains momentum Another bright spot is the tablet market has collapsed and with it the massive losses associated with Intels contrarevenue program which I had derided in previous articles Management failed badly here and lost over billion pursuing a market that soon fell into a massive decline It is not hindsight to say management should have seen this as many of us saw this incredibly obtuse program as poorly conceived long ago Luckily this appears to be less and less of a strain on the company although the real problem has not been addressed management The type of management that actually thought this was a good idea but thought selling processors to Apple NASDAQ AAPL for the initial iPhone was a bad one One they could not make money on There are other problems though that will only get worse Apples AX has become so powerful the days of Apple using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips in Macs is likely coming to an end This processor has at least the same IPC as Intels highend mobile parts As such it easily beats the Core M and is quite close to higher clocked i processors in performance There are big cost savings for Apple to using their own processors especially when they all use the same instruction set They also have much more control over the final product Although the AX is still not quite as powerful enough to replace x in the highend the enormous strides it has made show the time is nearing when it will be It is also important to note that these will almost certainly be made at TSMC NYSE TSM or Samsung OTCSSNLF and not at Intels plants further fueling the success of these competitors to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Apples successful processor designs not only portend an eventual move of the Mac to ARM but also limits the market for Intels processors in the tablet and phone market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has already accepted that its phone products would be lowend so it is not a big deal there But it does put more pressure on the tablet market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which in any case is already not in great shape The PC market will also get worse with AMDs move to Zen We do not know how much better it will be than AMDs current products but it is safe to say it will greatly close the gap that currently exists I say this because it finally moves AMDs processors to FinFETs and by all indications has substantial per core improvements over Excavator It is very possible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to have an overall advantage but if they are close this will put much more pricing pressure on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>With Intels delay of a nm part Kaby Lake which is likely the same architecture as Skylake given the timing will be Intels product that will compete with Zen It is conceivable AMD could have a product at least somewhat close to Kaby Lake although we should reserve judgment until we have more substantial information Storage Class Memory has been getting a lot of attention lately Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>initially exaggerated the characteristics of D XPoint it is still a very compelling technology However despite the nonsense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was trying to advance it does not in any way approximate the speed of DRAM and any uses in that capacity would bring with it a severe performance penalty unless the unit it was attached to was equally low performance However it is significantly faster than EEPROMs or Flash and should be cheaper to make than DRAM so will occupy a very important area between DRAM and Flash the latter of which is roughly times slower latency than the former There are three types of memory technologies vying for this space phasechange resistive memory and spintransfer RAM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and its partner Micron have chosen phasechange for D Xpoint Its not clear which of these will ultimately succeed it is clear the market for a memory with the persistence of Flash but with speeds closer to DRAM will continue to grow All in all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains mixed On the plus side the server group seems very safe and almost certain to keep growing The lowend phone market should also grow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as SoFIA matures IoT is less clear as it has not shown growth and the market has still not matured The jury is still out on D Xpoint although I do feel mildly optimistic towards it The PC market will be a challenge and likely continue to get worse in the foreseeable future How this all adds up is unclear but my guess would be mild growth in I do believe the server market will see a more significant uptick than the PC market will see a down tick In reality server growth seems nearly certain a continued erosion of PC revenue much less so I also believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will gain traction with SoFIA albeit it might be muted initially gaining momentum in the latter half of and into I also think D Xpoint will be a compelling technology in server scenarios but probably may also require time before it becomes a significant part of Intels revenue None of this will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a high growth company but any growth after so many years of stagnation has to be considered favorably Factor in the very attractive dividend and Intels relentless stock repurchasing programs and there could still be value in this as an investment stock especially at these relatively low prices Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
