gains by the end of AMDs management team is concentrating on just a few profitable areas The AMDIntel performance gap is about to shrink substantially On May Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD had an investors day conference where it outlined its future direction for products and sales During this presentation it made several points that I think will lead to a bright and profitable future In recent weeks AMDs stock price has dropped to about share giving it a market cap of only billion Thats barely of Intels NASDAQ INTC billion market cap In this article I will review what was presented and why it will result in a whole new AMD in the next years I will also explain how this new concentrated focus should lead to substantial profits It is important to see what AMD is not going to do as well as what it is going to do During this presentation AMD CEO Lisa Su presented a page outline of AMDs future plans Page was perhaps the most interesting in telling us in no uncertain terms what AMD was not going to invest in As the following chart shows AMD will be avoiding all the lowmargin products that might look good for sales but not for profits I agree Mark Papermaster is AMDs Chief Technology Officer formerly from Apple NASDAQ AAPL He outlined the three technical areas AMD will be concentrating on x CPU cores or Zen ARM cores or K and graphics enhancement By far the most important one to my way of thinking is Zen an all new x CPU that will be produced on nm FinFET just like Intels Skylake although it will probably be at least a year behind The point is that AMD does not need to beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with Zen it only needs to narrow the performance gap and it will certainly do that The key clause is this one Energyefficient FinFET design scales from client to enterpriseclass products Next up was Forrest Norrod the General Manager of Enterprise Embedded and Semicustom Business Group Norrods group is the nonPC part of the business and within that the most important part is the enterprise Thats where the big margins are and where a lot of energy and dollars will be spent I hope anyway With Zen and to a lesser extent K ARM in AMD will once more be able to challenge Intels death grip on the data center business Last but not least was the presentation of CFO Devinder Kumar who had the difficult job of explaining how AMD is going to manage its limited cash flow over the next few years The best point for me was Kumar saying any excess cash over billion would be used to pay down debt although theres none due until I also was surprised to see that in spite of all of AMDs myriad problems EBITDA has actually increased over the last three years Thats a very positive point I highly recommend viewing all of the presentations from AMDs website here Theres always a certain amount of song and tap dancing at these events but overall I thought it was well done It is obvious that under new management theres an increase in focus and discipline Product lines have been narrowed and priorities have been assigned Im fairly confident that the highest priority is the Zen development This is the product that will drive profits and cash flow to new heights Zen is designed to compete directly with the nearmonopoly status of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x product line both desktop and server By producing it on a nm FinFET process it will be AMDs first competitive CPU since perhaps the Athlon Will it compete with Intels highest performing products I dont know maybe not but it will be competitive over a huge swath of what was formerly unassailable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>country Whereas right now AMD competes only in the bottom or so of the desktop line Zen will conceivably make it competitive over the bottom and maybe even higher And in the server area it does not have any competitive product right now so it will certainly have access to a much higher percentage of enterprise sales than it does now And believe me OEMs and other big CPU customers cannot wait to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>get some competition Competition will drive prices down across the line so OEMs will be buying AMDs Zen products whenever and for whatever product they can Even if desktop sales are flat or down slightly overall I predict that AMD and Zen will increase AMDs market share So how much of the x market will AMD need to be successful Well consider the fact that in billion billion from PC Client and billion from Datacenter of Intels billion revenue came from legacy x products Thats right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is basically an x shop it makes huge gross margins and almost all of its profits from the legacy x line So if we assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x sales go from billion to billion in and AMD only picks up a very modest share from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>we are looking at billion in incremental sales For a small cap billion revenue business like AMD thats a very large sales increase and a hardly noticeable sales loss for a behemoth like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>As the much smaller player in the x duopoly AMD stands to benefit enormously by an enhanced competitive product like Zen The following chart is somewhat conservative It assumes only billion in revenue in which allows for a million loss in revenue from nonx products The gross margin from CFO Kumars presentation was from to so I used and The SGA is the lower end of Kumars to because AMD has been very disciplined in the SGA area AMDs decadelong problem has been execution and that is the biggest risk It just does not deliver the products as described on time is a long way away and cash flow could be a big problem between now and then if legacy products cant generate enough sales andor margin to keep them cash flow positive Takeorpay contracts with Global Foundries could bite them like they did in when they had to pay million TSMCs or a different contractors nm FinFET process does not produce a high enough yield to deliver Zen products in quantity Sometimes we forget that AMD is a bitplayer in the x CPU market But it is a very profitable duopoly though right now only profitable for the big player <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Because of the distorted market shares the little guy can greatly improve the outcome by picking up just a small piece of the big guys market Zen is a product that can do that At the current price of about you should look at AMD as a longterm LEAP without an expiration date The other advantage is AMDs price in is uncorrelated to the market and could be used as a hedge on a market downturn between now and then On the other hand nothing new or exciting is going to show up until at least the fourth quarter so you could probably wait until then to make an investment Source AMD This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AnkleBiter Is On Its Way To Substantial Profits Disclosure The author has no positions in any
