Apple already has annual redesign cycles for the key components of the iPhone the processor and the operating system In light of intensifying competition its more likely that Apple will fully redesign the iPhone every year starting this year Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone is facing intensified competition from Samsung OTCSSNLF and Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi Private XI and may face the first ever yearoveryear decline in sales for fiscal year Recent rumors that Apple will move the iPhone to a threeyear refresh cycle suggests that Apples management will respond to this pressure in exactly the wrong way I disagree When the Nikkei reported that Apple would move the iPhone to a threeyear refresh cycle appeared on May I found it so ludicrous that I decided to simply ignore it I had already written about the Nikkeis gratuitous trashing of the iPhone a couple of weeks before I didnt think that this latest rumor was even worth writing about Like so many rumors if theres an audience that wants to believe it it tends to take on a life of its own The May Nikkei rumor has now been so oft repeated on the Internet that its being treated as if it were solid fact The latest example of this is the naive and uncritical regurgitation of the rumor yesterday by Don Reisinger of Fortune Like so many recent rumors the Nikkei report is more about disparaging Apple and its products than making accurate prognostications Lets look at the rumor in a little more detail and the reader will see what I mean Apple will likely take three years between fullmodel changes of its iPhone devices a year longer than the current cycle In a typical twoyear term fall was supposed to see a major upgrade But the changes on the model to be launched this autumn will be minor such as improved camera quality The move is largely due to smartphone functions having little room left for major enhancements A slowing market is another factor The article insists that the iPhone will look almost like the iPhone s and offer minimal improvements The article completely ignores Apples most important technological innovation in the iPhone Apples custom designed systems on chip SOC Instead the rumor suggests that Apple is dependent on its suppliers for innovation Reisinger basically repeats this with the same utter lack of understanding of Apples semiconductor innovation Why do the rumors consistently ignore Apples innovation in semiconductors This would seem to be a glaring omission considering that Apple took the industry by surprise when it introduced the first bit ARM smartphone processor in for the iPhone s Most importantly Apple doesnt just license designs from ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH but does its own ground up designs that consistently outperform its industry peers Apple has been producing fresh SOC designs every year regardless of whether the iPhone is an s generation The next SOC for the iPhone will likely put Apple ahead of the pack again With competitors such as Samsung and Huawei also scratchdesigning their own SOCs Apple couldnt possibly put this element of the iPhone on a threeyear refresh cycle Why does the media consistently ignore this element of Apples engineering prowess Let me suggest an answer Its because Apple has become one of the most powerful and influential semiconductor companies in the world I made this point over a year ago here on Seeking Alpha At the time I pointed out that Apples semiconductor business treated as a standalone business was growing far faster than the industry and faster than the top three semiconductor companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN As of the last article I only included data through fiscal year for the companies involved Including results for fiscal Apple accelerated its growth while the industry including Apple declined overall as I show in the following charts Keep in mind that for Apples semiconductor shipments Im only counting iOS devices because Apple reports its iOS device unit shipments I assume an equivalent revenue of per chip probably very conservative If Apple TV and Watch were included Apples numbers would be even higher Another possible explanation for the rumors may be to blunt what is likely to be another revolution is mobile SOCs that will debut with the iPhone This is the use of a new chip packaging technology pioneered by Apples foundry partner TSMC NYSE TSM called Integrated Fan Out InFO I can imagine the readers eyes glazing over at this but bear with me This is important What InFO does is allow even more functionality to be integrated into the SOC package by providing a way to integrate multiple separate chips along with the SOC TSMC has all but made it an open secret that it is working on InFO for Apples next SOC slated to go into the iPhone This will be the first ever use of InFO in a high volume mobile device InFO will allow an overall reduction in the size and thickness of the current circuit card assembly CCA in the iPhone For reference I show the CCA front and back from the current iPhone s Imagine that circuit card assembly getting thinner by virtue of not having to have components on both sides Power consumption for the iPhone will probably be reduced as well partly through the use of InFO partly through greater integration of functions into the SOC itself Every year Apples SOCs have integrated more functions allowing for the use of fewer external chips InFO will accelerate this process of parts count reduction Reduced power consumption will allow the battery to be smaller as well The net effect will probably be a reduction in the volume and weight of the phone that could be more than incremental A thinner phone will require significant redesign of the internal structure in order to avoid a repeat of bend gate Apple addressed this issue with the s generation and will be sure not to ignore it for the iPhone All in all I consider these changes to add up to a significant generational redesign regardless of what the exterior of the phone looks like In addition to the rumors that the iPhone will be little changed have been rumors that the next iPhone in which would be an s year will be greatly changed with the inclusion of Apples first ever OLED screen Looked at objectively one would think that the obvious conclusion to draw is that Apple is abandoning the s generation approach for an annual design refresh But somehow this just gets completely twisted around Apple is already doing annual design refreshes for the critical components of the iPhone the operating system and processor So why is Apple supposed to fall back to a threeyear cycle Because it cant afford a oneyear cycle Come on The sensible conclusion is that Apple is moving to a oneyear cycle Naturally every year the magnitude and types of innovations will not be the same I made fun of the limited innovations in iOS this year calling this an s year for iOS but changes will not be consistent from year to year Apple is still releasing a new version of iOS every year not every three years The same goes for SOCs Apples one year cycle refresh for the iPhone is bad news for its competitors good news for its investors I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a year investment horizon
