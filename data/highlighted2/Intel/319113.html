Holdings The Four Billion Device Advantage ARM Holdings plc NASDAQARMH Seeking Alpha ARM reported substantial growth in Q in processor shipments revenue and income yet was punished by the market The ARM ecosystem continues to grow supported by major partners such as Alphabet Apple and Qualcomm In the December quarter ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH reports that billion ARM architecture devices were shipped an alltime high To put that in perspective thats more than all of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC processors currently in use including PCs and servers The ARM processor ecosystem has become a huge and unstoppable behemoth ARMs yy revenue growth for Q was in British pounds in USD to million Operating income was million up yy in USD up in pounds Despite these excellent results ARM closed lower the day of the earnings report on February An article in Benzinga was fairly typical of coverage of the stock Analysts Agree ARM Holdings Is A Dead Stock So now if we are to believe Mr Chowdhry mere revenue growth is no longer enough there has to be acceleration of growth or the stock becomes uninteresting Theres a clear double standard here The Q earnings reports of both Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>were warmly received by analysts despite an absence of growth let alone acceleration In addition Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Q results were rightfully acclaimed in the media as very strong results but the results of ARM and Alphabet are very comparable Alphabets Q revenue increased by yy and operating income increased by The market reaction to ARMs results is in my view indicative of just how inefficient the market is in the shortterm As Ive observed market behavior the past few years its becoming increasingly apparent that the market isnt reading the actual earnings reports of companies like ARM or Apple NASDAQ AAPL its just reading the media take on them Theres currently a battle for investor hearts and minds playing out in the media along various technological fault lines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>vs ARM Windows vs Mac Android vs iOS Generally the tech media are playing it safe and appealing to conventional wisdom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must ultimately triumph over ARM Windows over Mac Android over iOS Part of the problem with the conventional wisdom is that its selfcontradictory A good example of this is the difference in reaction to Googles results compared to ARMs I pointed specifically to Google because its one of the key players driving growth of the ARM ecosystem In Q nearly million smartphones were shipped according to IDC All but an insignificant fraction of those used ARM processors and more than of them employed the Android operating system Googles Android has been and continues to be a huge growth driver for ARM especially since Android has been adapted to so many other devices including set top boxes and car infotainment systems Google currently claims greater than a billion active users of Android As I pointed out in Sundar Pichais Very Good Call Google appears to be poised to convert Android into a truly universal operating system that will span desktop laptop tablet and smartphone For the most part these will all be based on ARM devices Googles move not only expands the target market for Android but ARM as well Apple also contributes another roughly million iOS tvOS and watchOS users which are based exclusively on Apples ARM architecture devices iPhone iPad Apple TV and Apple Watch Apple recently announced that it has a billion devices including Mac in active use In an interview Apple executives stated that there are million iCloud users less than the total number of devices because Apple users often have more than one device So Android and iOS users total more than billion more than is commonly claimed for Windows about billion and almost all of these run on ARM processors More importantly the ARM user base is actually growing whereas the user population of Windows has been stagnant for years As large as the smartphone market is it accounted for only of total ARM processor shipments in Q The balance was made up in areas such as telecom switching and even a few servers but mostly in the so called embedded controller market This has always been a strong area of growth for ARM due to lightweight low power and low cost of ARM based controllers The embedded market is rapidly transforming into the Internet of Things market as ARM controllers receive Wifi and cellular communication capability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has placed high hopes of capturing a significant portion of the IoT market but ARMs cost advantage is eventually going to overcome Intels efforts just as it did in smartphones One of the chief beneficiaries of the move to connected embedded devices will be Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM which is looking for adjacent markets and IoT is in its cross hairs Qualcomms experience in modem technology and combining modems with application processors on a single chip gives it industry leadership in this space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has yet to integrate any of its modems on any of its processors As one looks at the ARM revenue and processor shipment data for the past few years it becomes obvious that revenue has grown almost in lock step with processor shipments as the chart below shows Operating income has trended even higher due to the fact that operating expenses have grown more slowly than revenue ARM continues to expand its RD but has been careful to do so at a slower rate than revenue growth Also the opportunities to accelerate revenue growth do exist Revenue growth for ARM was greatly accelerated by the advent of the bit version of the ARM architecture ARM v which gave ARM processors much more muscle Apples first ARM v processor was introduced in Q and by the following year many competitors such as Samsung OTCSSNLF were bringing ARM v devices to market ARM receives higher royalties on ARM v devices The chart below shows ARMs yy revenue growth for pounds ARM is continuing to enhance the performance of the ARM architecture in order to make it more useful for personal computing and server applications ARM continues to develop low power and low cost variants for the embeddedIoT market as well The bottom line is that I dont see any justification for the negativity about ARM ARM has three huge industry partners going for it Alphabet Apple and Qualcomm Thats a lot of firepower on ARMs side Increasingly Ive been drawn to the conclusion that in the area of ARM vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ultimately ARM will overwhelm its opponent It already has a gross numerical advantage and its gaining rapidly in performance Apples latest Apple Ax processor in the iPad Pro is about as good as an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core m The fact that it isnt quite as good should not blind anyone to the overall trend ARM processors are rapidly gaining on Intels Core series Which means that ARM processors are becoming competitive for general purpose computing and even servers Ive pointed out that Qualcomms efforts in the server area could bear fruit But even if Qualcomm falters in this area the overall trend is clear ARM processors eventually are going to win over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>on cost in every market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>serves or aspires to serve There is the interesting issue of whether ARM is overvalued It has kind of seemed that way in the past year but as the reader may have noticed ARMs normalized stock price has fallen below the operating income curve in the above chart This suggests to me that ARMs valuation has corrected There may still be some more downside Since the end of ARMs stock price declined another along with much of the tech market I doubt that theres any hurry to buy ARM but its a stock Ill be looking at as a buy in the near future In the mean time its very definitely a hold I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with
