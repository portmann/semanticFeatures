The Recent Executive Shuffle Good For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels top ranks went through some reorganization with the departure of Renee James Generally speaking investors react negatively when top executives leave unless if theres some sort of succession plan or if this was broadly anticipated for quite some time Its likely that this will further consolidate and simplify the decision making process for Intels current CEO Brian Krzanich Investors have interpreted this as positive news However it puts further pressure on Brian to deliver a blowout on second half earnings Otherwise hell be quickly out the door too In recent months boardrooms have become antsy with their CEOs and its no wonder people need something to believe in especially when theyre chasing after stocks on the back half of a multiyear market rally Intels NASDAQ INTC recently had an executive shuffle and its not clear whether this will positively impact the company over a longer timeframe Quoted from The wall Street Journal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp said President Rene James is stepping down to seek a chief executive job elsewhere one of several management changes announced Thursday as CEO Brian Krzanich pushes the chip maker to move more quickly Ms James yearsold is one of the most prominent female executives in Silicon Valley and the highestranking woman ever at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>She agreed to stay until the end of the year to help with transition planning Mr Krzanich said in a letter to employees In another highprofile change longtime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Capital chief Arvind Sodhani would retire in January the company said The recent executive shuffle is a little hard to evaluate so I decided to put on my reading glasses and go through some industry journals to get a better sense of how executive departures impact the price of a stock For the most part the reaction to the recent departure was positive as evidenced by the stock price but generally speaking its not always the case that this occurs I think what differentiates this departure is that initially both Renee James and Brian Krzanich were tasked with running the company as CoCEOs However according to the WSJ Brian Krzanich was able to take over many of Renees responsibilities So James departure can be interpreted positively as shes become more redundant and less important in the daytoday operations of the business Furthermore it may give Brian added flexibility when making strategic decisions or larger acquisitions In addition when asked to name the key factors affecting an organizations reputation in the investment community CEO reputation was among the top six factors cited That was nearly on par with the companys historical reputation itself and more important than the brand equity of a companys products and services When CEOs change investors are more than twice as likely to sell shares in a company as they are to buy them All things being equal nearly of investors said they would sell a stock solely on the basis of the new CEO the FTI Consulting survey found while only said they would buy the stock on the same basis Generally speaking executive transitions can be a little a tricky for shareholders In this case the positive response and the undulating confidence in Brian Krzanich shouldnt come to anyones surprise as hes a pretty astute manager and has been able to pivot the company in the right direction Mobile and enterprise are the two growth pillars for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at the present moment and while the company has scaled back RD theres no denying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had made inroads on both fronts in the past year For the most part I think shareholders can anticipate the stock to recover going into the end of the year PC demand should stabilize following the launch of Windows Also continuing share gains in mobile and ongoing growth in enterprise will lift the share price higher Therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation and price target Source Was The Recent Executive Shuffle Good For <span style='background-color:
