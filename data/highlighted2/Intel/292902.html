my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article TSMC reported an yy decline in revenue for Q TSMCs results and guidance for Q indicate that parts of the smartphone industry are under considerable stress TSMCs business with Apple continues to be a source of strength for both companies as TSMC is poised to deliver the processors for the next gen iPhone TSMCs NYSE TSM Q earnings report was decidedly mixed for the company Revenue for the quarter declined by yy and guidance for Q was for another yy decline For Apple NASDAQ AAPL the news was positive however as revenue from the most advanced processes used for iPhone and s has been growing since Q Most importantly TSMCs cutting edge technology will confer a significant new advantage for the next iPhone Last quarters TSMC earnings teleconference was extremely informative from an Apple investor perspective as I highlighted in What TSMC Has Revealed About Apples Future Perhaps there was a perception on Apples part that a little too much information had been divulged prompting an executive level call from Cupertino In an atypical move TSMC elder statesman and Chairman of the Board Dr Morris Chang presided over the TSMC earnings telecon this past Thursday He fielded most of the questions allowing the coCEOs CC Wei and Mark Liu to speak only rarely I got the distinct impression that Chang was there to make sure that nothing pertaining to Apple was said Fortunately for us he was only partially successful However the tighter control of information and the nature of TSMCs financial reporting do make it somewhat difficult to draw conclusions regarding Apple for the December and March quarters Daniel Eran Dilger was quick to hail TSMCs overall revenue growth for of as casting doubt on bearish sentiment about Apple But Dilger didnt take a very careful look at TSMCs results Most of TSMCs revenue growth occurred in the first half of the year with flat revenue in Q and the above mentioned revenue decline of yy in Q TSMC has been hurt by declining business from customers such as Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM TSMC was sole source for the A processor in the iPhone Plus so the tremendous success of iP more than compensated for Qualcomms decline in the first half of the year For iPhone ss Plus A SOC production was split between Samsung OTCSSNLF and TSMC reportedly with for TSMC The production split along with the fact that TSMC has other customers for the two nodes nm and nm being used for iPhone and s production makes interpreting TSMCs results problematic TSMC only reports revenue for the combined and nm nodes In the chart below I show revenue for Q and Q for and for the and nm nodes In only the nm node was operational In Q TSMC ramped up the nm node and combined with its existing nm production produced a huge yy jump in nm node revenue of However the Q increase was very modest at yy The revenue from nm was virtually all due to Apple TSMC was sole source for the A SOC in the iPhone Plus so all of Apples iP production used TSMC The same cant be said this year but in the chart below I give my estimates for TSMCs nm processor output used by Apple for Q and Q of and As the reader can see theres been a yy decline in TSMC processor deliveries to Apple in Q mostly as a result of the split with Samsung but also due to a decline in shipments of A processors for the iP Does this mean I think theres been a yy decline in iPhone shipments for the December quarter No it doesnt TSMCs production in Q was more than enough to exceed Apples needs for processors for the iPhone and s series given the split with Samsung I currently estimate that Apple sold between million iPhones of all types in the December quarter The main concern I have right now is for the March quarter yeah me and every other Apple investor Both Foxconns and TSMCs monthly revenue declined towards the end of the December quarter which was in marked contrast to last year But this was total monthly revenue from all sources and both companies have other customers besides Apple Given all the supply chain rumors that have been going around its hard not to be a little concerned about the March quarter The March quarter may prove to be the tougher compare than December I point out the decline in iPhone processor shipments for TSMC in Q not to sound alarms about iPhone but to point out the need for Apple to jettison Samsung as a foundry partner as soon as possible It is generally assumed that TSMC will be the sole source for Apples next generation SOC to be used in iPhone the A Focusing on TSMC will enable closer collaboration as well as reduced cost for Apple This is where information divulged by TSMC at the Q earnings call gets interesting TSMC has a chip technology called integrated fanout or inFO for short InFO provides a very compact way to combine multiple chips in a single package that also promises to be very cost effective compared to existing technologies TSMC indicated that only a few major customers will be offered inFO in seeming to confirm a recent rumor that Apple would be one of those customers for the A The advantage of inFO is that it provides a way to combine many different functions in a single package InFO could provide a way to combine functions currently performed by chips from Dialog Semiconductor DLG power management and Cirrus Logic NASDAQ CRUS audio codec within the A package along with a wireless modem from Qualcomm Theres already a process going on to incorporate increasing functionality onto the SOC InFO just accelerates this process The ongoing process of putting more functionality on the SOC combined with inFO may serve to explain the guidance of many Apple chip suppliers Most of these suppliers are living on borrowed time Eventually some or all of the functions performed by external chips will be consolidated into the SOC or the inFO package Even for separate silicon integrated via inFO Apple may choose to license designs and produce the silicon itself Declining revenue is probably going to become a fact of life for Apples nonSOC chip suppliers At the very end of the teleconference TSMC finally let fall an absolute gem of business intelligence HSBC analyst Steven Pelayo asked Okay And then my second question was you had an anchor customer at nanometer in the second half of that appears to be staying on nanometer as they go into Does this mean there could be die size increases as they add more functionality and perhaps more wafers needed from you Well I dont comment on the die size but I can tell you that they add a lot of functionality inside So you look at the smartphone they have become better and better SOC functionality invariably grows as process node shrinks and its the second tier chip suppliers that get hurt in the process This may be at least a partial explanation for the tales of woe we are hearing from them I recently received a comment to the effect that didnt I realize that Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC were in talks concerning foundry services When I get comments like this it seems to me that the commenter just isnt up on current events Apple allowed Samsung to be a second source for nm FinFET in late because it just couldnt take the risk of inadequate supply for the iPhone s launch last September There was a lot of added expense associated with this since the Samsung and TSMC processes were not identical Apple is clearly motivated to reduce foundry suppliers and there is already so much momentum in favor of TSMC that I dont see any possibility of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gaining a foothold Dr Chang repeatedly emphasized during the teleconference the element of trust that TSMC brings to the table Can Apple really trust foundry services from companies that are also arch competitors When you go to a foundry you have to show them the details of your SOC design Can Apple really afford to keep doing that with either Samsung or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I dont think so In the long run theres too much chance of data leakage out of the foundry to other parts of the competitor company Fortunately for Apple TSMC is rapidly becoming the technology leader in foundry services TSMCs inFO will provide exclusive cost and performance advantages to Apple for its next generation smartphones due to arrive this fall And nm will follow in TSMC will likely be the first foundry to achieve full scale production at nm Although there may be some near term concern about iPhone for the March quarter the TSMC partnership will cement Apples technological leadership in smartphones for the next two years Apples profit share for the smartphone market estimated at appears quite secure even if Apple does suffer some near term decline in market share I remain bullish on Apple and consider it a buy Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
