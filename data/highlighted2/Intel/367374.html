Reasons You Cant Short Facebook Hold Rating Now But Looking To Go To Buy Rating Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebook is a game changer with years of market leadership ahead No other player can easily catch up to Facebooks share of social Facebook NASDAQ FB is expected to report earnings April th after the market close There seems to be some concerns about Facebooks upcoming quarter from several Wall Street firms We think there is a chance that revenues can accelerate and beat Street estimates despite many of the recent worrisome reports Because the stock is up in a deserved straight line we have to be patient for a pullback For that we have a hold rating If the stock were not up in a straight line it would be worthy of a buy At times traders have the urge to short a stock up too much on value which is typically a losing plan unless they sniff out a chink in the armor For that reason we wanted to list reasons why we dont think Facebook is a short for potentially years to come Revenue growth was up in Q versus in Q The twoyear run rate of growth has been consistently now for quarters see chart below If they keep up the growth then the reported revenues should be above the Street expectations for the next couple of quarters You can see above that the Street numbers imply a slowdown of the extremely steady year trends which may prove conservative Facebook May Weather An Economic Slowdown On the last conference call the company said they were not seeing a slowdown unlike other companies We think that a slowdown may spur advertisers to more carefully review their ad spend and ensure that it is directed to high ROI projects Facebook has the ability to show their advertisers the direct payback immediately We expect this to cause Facebook to take share from

international company has tapped into over the last couple of decades is still virgin territory for Facebook This is a huge opportunity for them And if you say does not include stock compensation and other regular expenses so then they still have GAAP EBIT Margins which does include the kitchen sink That doesnt exist everywhere Mobile About To Increase Their Growth Rate Mobile is most of their revenues and growing faster stealing share fast from the PC business If the pace of mobile continues it will take the companys overall growth rate higher In fact last quarters revenue growth rate did accelerate from previous quarters For consumers they own that mobile experience right now Near Reach to Year Olds If you are an advertiser and you want to target people that change their mind to switch buying habits thats this demographic As people age they stop changing as much You need to catch them young There is almost no other opportunity out there for an advertiser to capture the entire target audience in one choice Facebook offers that choice which is unparalleled in any media vertical If we think back to past competitive fields on new technology industries one player won there were close seconds and the leader kept their lead for some time Facebook won social Apple NASDAQ AAPL GoogleAlphabet NASDAQ GOOG and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT cant win it back for one reason For social the amount of people using the platform matters to the users themselves cycling the winners competitive position and consumer stickiness Here consumers need to be on Facebook Its going to be tough to rip them away from need to be This is share to keep which is in the hands of Facebook not to lose Technology winners can hold their lead for decades Think back to Microsoft that didnt relinquish their PC lead for years Facebook has that potential How can you face people saying I shorted Facebook Okay waiting to buy makes sense but shorting may be embarrassing at least in the long term Imagine admitting you shorted Microsoft Apple or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC years ago Great companies and great talent are one thing but a great company needs a visionary
