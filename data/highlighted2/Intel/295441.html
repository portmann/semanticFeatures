but may initiate a long position in INTC over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article The PC market saw another bad quarter in Q even though the scenario is less negative if we account the detachables IDC and Gartner expect flat growth in detachables included The Windows upgrade and new graphic cards could increase PC sales The performance per watt increase for new graphic cards will be massive given the jump from nm to nm and the Polaris preview I expect PC sales to be equal or a little better than forecasted with positive implications for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft IDC and Gartner recently released their Q report for PC sales they estimate a reduction of in Q while IDC estimates a reduction of for IDC also states that the reduction sets at in Q and in the entire with detachables It is clear that Skylake and Windows lifted only a bit of sales but IDC and Gartner also expect that the scenario will change and it is getting better in IDC expects a little growth of in accounting for detachables also while Gartner expects a decline of without accounting for detachables There also is another report from Gartner that shows that PC sales are going to grow in the following years traditional PC in devices mostly thanks to the in devices All of this is similar to previous forecasts released by Gartner and IDC in the previous years but you know that they turned out to be quite unreliable Will this year show the same behavior This time I think that things are going to get better First of all the upcoming lineup of ultrabooks laptops and in tablets looks more and more complete at this stage Lenovo Samsung HP Dell Acer and Razer have shown a lot of good looking thin and more powerful devices providing various devices with thunderbolt ports some enthusiast gamers will be happy a real sense camera more portability high crafting quality products and mostly a higher availability of different solutions most of all in Until the only valid choice for in devices was the Surface Pro lineup but starting in things look quite different with a higher grade of competitiveness I expect that the in devices will partially lift the PC growth issue given that it is the segment with the highest growth potential but that is not the lone segment which will help the PC sales Nvidia Corporation NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD are going to make a big jump with their GPU architecture and technologies they will go with nm node process and they will provide new architectures Pascal and PolarisCGN introducing also the HBM It is true that common users do not need a discrete GPU Productivity users mainstream users and casual gamers find the integrated GPU to be sufficient for their needs But for those who are geeks nerds enthusiasts typical or hardcore gamers or they use some kind of GPU intensive programs video editors D editors graphic designer and so on those are a different matter That is where things are changing this year First the technology node jump is quite remarkable jumping from the nm to the nm provides an enormous boost for transistor density electromigration decrease and power efficiency The projected boost is quite bigger than the jump from nm to nm therefore we can expect more performing graphic cards through the year Nvidia and AMD will introduce the HBM with a potential bandwidth of TBs per each GPU chip providing a very high computational margin and the chance to quickly execute calculation with lower cache miss fear and decreased slowdowns due to filters These two companies will provide new architectures with doubled transistors renewed shaders prefetches and so on For what concerns the FP units Nvidia will finally provide full FP calculation at double speed of FP Maxwell could not First Polaris preview showed that AMD is able to provide a graphic solution as fast as the GTX Maxwell but demanding half of its power consumption Given that even Pascal will jump from nm to nm it is easy to say that Nvidia will provide a massive efficiency boost too Therefore the next GPU generation is going to show great performance per watt boosts which will be a very positive factor for both mobile and desktop environments This implies that laptops and ultrabooks in the H will come with beefed up graphic solutions becoming a lot more desirable At the same time the desktops workstations and servers demand for graphic cards will likely grow up this year given the massive projected boost for both peak performance and performance per watt Obviously professionals gamers and enthusiast users which are likely to get an upgrade this year cannot move massive sales But it is evident that the upcoming solutions are able to provide something remarkable at least from the graphic and quality point of view that was not available in the last few years and this must increase sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQ INTC has managed to attain a very good boost with its HD Gen GPUs in fact it is able to meet decent performance that was not predictable in the past In addition the eDRAM versions are sold at a price similar to the other normal i and i SoCs providing graphic performance at least on par with a Nvidia M <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to release its HD Graphic Gen this summer with Kaby Lake and the MorganfieldWillow Trail platforms Given the great performance per watt jump that Nvidia and AMD will provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may be working on some very optimized graphic architecture moreover if it wants to obtain great improvements in the mobile sector with the Morganfield platform powered by the Goldmont cores A performing GPU is one of the requirements to compete even in the highend SoC segment Finally we must not forget that VR will start to drive some sales and that is something to look for in the following years Microsoft Nvidia AMD and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are all companies that could generate additional revenues from this market Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Windows is another important factor to consider it is true that Windows did not stop the PC sales slump yet but expectations are brighter for the next couple of years For example the enterprise segment will see an increase of device sales in relation to Windows because the demand is really consistent but the firms were not ready andor keen to integrate Windows in their systems with Windows things are becoming quite different Note that a lot of the new ultrabooks and in present at CES are devices suitable for the business and enterprise segment In addition testing Windows at business level takes a quite long period of time therefore it is natural that Windows will lift sales only starting from You can grasp this point looking at this link the Windows business adoption timeline comprises that was likely to immediately use Windows is going to update within one year and a is going to make the update within one to two years Obviously those who are willing to update within one year will be concentrated on the second part of the timeframe Therefore the first six months have been more consumer related Another important factor is that there are hundreds of million of old PCs which are at least four years old and they are waiting for some upgrade or total renovation The installed base is very huge and it hides a very consistent sales potential Take me as an example I assembled my last PC exactly seven years ago and I made two small upgrades through the years This PC has served me well even after three or four years it is still fast powerful enough and effective Now after seven years it cannot provide decent performance anymore and when I consider new technologies real sense Windows various CPU generations various GPU generations M SSDs Thunderbolt laptop capabilities and so on I understand that its time is running out Obviously my needs are more professional or business like and they have changed through time but this segment is quite big and important and if you have read the previous assumptions you will understand that the market is probably going to settle and grow at least a little In addition remember that it is very hard to see a business or professional user to live with the same piece of hardware for seven years What about consumers Consumers are the most resistant customers at this point Excluding gamers and enthusiasts which I have treated before in the article the average user is capable of living even with a seven yearsold PC if it is a highend one At the same time there are various common actions which are simply replicable by a tablet a phablet or a smartphone and that is one of the main causes for the market slowdown and China related problems But there also are various operations which still cannot be smoothly achieved without a laptop or PC and that is why detachables are growing fast The consumer market may be the most problematic but still it could find a somehow stable settlement in the next couple of years Among these matters Windows Mobile could be an additional market mover in some way Windows Mobile looks good with the only problem being the lack of applications But from this point of view developers are starting to pay more attention to the Windows mobile environment with various upcoming universal applications that were not present before In addition having a Continuum between Windows desktop and Windows mobile it will obviously bring in some new customers which consider the system unification as a strong point At the same time a recent MSDN document showed that Microsoft is really working on a x Windows Mobile version an OS that could be able to virtually run a lot of x applications That would be a great and very interesting feature first of all for the enthusiast and professional segments but also for the consumer sector The synergy with continuum could be really massive and it would be the right and perfect way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to gain market share in the mobile sector attacking directly the mid and highend market Here comes the real issue China The recent Chinese downturn is concerning and it is putting pressure on companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and AMD But it is the entire macro environment in China that makes investors to tremble AMD has cut its guidance for next quarter due to China issues while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>showed soft demand from China from both the consumer and enterprise segment China and emerging markets will likely continue to be consistent headwinds for PC sales and sectors like DCG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>but given the scenario year will probably be positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft while PC sales could still see some growth in H Microsoft is expected to see a big adoption growth in the enterprisebusiness sector as already stated therefore its services will likely meet growing revenues and profits At the same time the outlook would change for better But even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will likely see better times in the last Q call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stated that Skylake production pushed the nm products to reach more than of the CCG solutions lowering its inherent costs In addition i and K SKUs for gaming those topend processors and unblocked multiplier processors enriched the product mix obtaining an alltime volume The consequence is that the sector revenue was down only by and the gross margin increased QQ Therefore with flat or low PC sales growth for we can expect a revenue increase for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which will continue to ramp up nm production Kaby Lake is coming in mid increasing the nm portfolio and its scalability new SoFIA SoCs will be introduced during nm SoCs also increasing nm portfolio and scalability and we will see a new global GPU offer which will obviously drive an additional enrichment of i and K SKUs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since enthusiasts will be more keen to make a beefy upgrade this time This will be mostly related to the new GPU offer which will trigger new graphic cards in the following months and updated laptops and ultrabooks mainly in H The upcoming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphic Gen may move additional sales if the performance increase will be similar to the Skylake upgrade There also is curiosity about the CPU side where Kaby Lake must be a new architecture and it must be seen what kind of performance or performance per watt increase will be obtained Clearly the recent months of turmoil related to ISIS China and oil issues makes the scenario quite difficult to be predictable By the way I rate Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a buy on the long term mainly accounting for the enterprise growth for Microsoft and the possible CCG growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still discounts the traditional CCG issues and the Q results the reaction to Q is excessively influenced by the sentiment and it is a quite good entry point for the long term Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still has high potential with D Xpoint Network Virtualization Cloud memory business the and FPGA Altera business In particular the Altera business is really underestimated when a preview sample already showed very remarkable improvements in performance and efficiency Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
