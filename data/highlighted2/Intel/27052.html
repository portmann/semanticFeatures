Seeking Alpha The diminution in the PC client business is baked into the share price Investors will focus more on mobile losses and cash burn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is set to announce quarterly earnings afterhours on Tuesday Analysts expect revenue of billion and EPS of The revenue estimate assumes a decline sequentially Below are the companys historical financial results The expected decline in sales of the PC client group is well known The following are two other key metrics investors should focus on Last quarter Intels mobile communications division had contrarevenue of million and an operating loss of billion If Intels mobile strategy works it could offset revenue losses from its PC client group In The company placed chips in million tablets Recent rumors suggest its XMM G baseband modem will be inside the iPhone in certain emerging markets a big coup assuming the rumors are true The question remains Can Intels mobile operations turn a profit Management has declared it will raise mobile revenue while wringing out million in costs During the earnings call I expect investors to ascertain how credible management is at executing its mobile strategy The company is expected to use a new financial reporting structure where it combines the operations for chips for personal computers with the operations of chips for mobile devices Whether the new reporting structure is an attempt to obfuscate revenue andor losses in its mobile division remains to be seen Either way expect analysts to drill down on mobile operating losses If its operating losses continue Intels mobile strategy may have an expiration date The companys mobile losses dividends and stock buybacks have taken a toll on cash flow In the company generated positive cash flow of billion However the company experienced cash burn of billion in and billion in Part of that cash burn has been driven by stock buybacks and dividends which totaled billion in That said cash on hand declined from billion to billion at the end of the year Total liquid assets cash shortterm investments and trading assets declined from billion in to billion at yearend That is a longwinded way of saying that a few more billion hits to cash could create a financial strain Before it gets to that level either Intels mobile strategy dividend payouts or buybacks may have to be shuttered Dividend payouts have consistently been about billion The dividend is important for yield hungry investors in the current low interest rate environment Cutting the dividend would be disastrous and would signal that the company is in serious trouble financially The dividend would be the last to go if at all The growth of mobile devices has encroached on desktop PC use and this trend will continue To stem losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may need to increase prices of its mobile chips sacrificing market share That said I do not see the company shuttering its mobile operations any time soon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bought back nearly billion in stock in INTC is up over over the past months yet off the week high set in Q If worse comes to worst <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would most likely end its buyback program first Longs shouldnt fret though if the stock continues to decline or if the general market pulls back there will be ample opportunity to buy more shares at a lower price Revenue declines in the PC client unit are baked into the share price Investors should now focus on how well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is executing its mobile strategy and managing cash flow Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Earnings
