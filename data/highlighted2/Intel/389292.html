#A9E2F3'>Intel </span>financial performance while strong has disappointed investors Notwithstanding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock has outpaced Qualcomm for several years Neither stock looks particularly attractive near term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC investors dumped their stock last week on what some saw as less than expected financial performance and outlook The fact is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings were robust and the sellers may rue that decision Year over year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>posted an gain in revenues and a gain in net income That is not shabby for a company the size of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The weakness in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock may have less to do with current sales and profits and more to do with trends in the chip market AMD NASDAQ AMD is making a last ditch effort to resurrect itself as a key competitor by licensing x technology to third parties and introducing its Zen line of processors this fall with expected performance gains of about That together with its world class GPUs may be enough to let AMD survive and ultimately become a profitable competitor At the same time Intels massive share of server processors is vulnerable not only to a resurgent AMD but also to ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH processors from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC The server market continues to grow but nonx based servers now have a meaningful share of the total pie making up billion of the million total market in the fourth quarter of Having said that the nonx segment demonstrated a decline while the x server market grew in that quarter A reversal of that trend would be a serious setback for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and while it is too early to predict such an event there is little doubt that the ARM based server manufacturers are eager to capture more volume in the segment particularly in server farms supporting cloudbased services The potential for increased competition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>comes at a time when the PC market is in steady decline with growth in Windows based two in one devices insufficient to offset the erosion of the traditional PC market Longer term Intels growth in microchips for the Internet of Things IoT should develop into a meaningful business but that event seems distant today with IoT chips currently representing only of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sees billion chips for IoT devices by but those chips sell for pennies Even so billion chips at even per chip still comprises a billion market which is large even by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>standards In the IoT market comprised an estimated billion chips Qualcomm is the key competitor in IoT markets and reportedly shipped billion in IoT chips in Intels IoT chip shipments were billion according to the company With the PC market in decline and a measureable risk that competition may take a bigger bite out of server markets now dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>investors might move to the sidelines for a while and monitor Intels progress in the IoT space Despite some success in tablets Intels effort to carve out a major role in mobile communications have been disappointing and there is no reason to believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is on the verge of any major breakout in the mobile market except possibly the potential for a modem in a future iPhone Intels expensive foray into tablets saw it take a sizeable share of the noniPad tablet market but at a great cost as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>effectively subsidized its Atom processors to bull its way into the tablet space Today that strategy looks like misadventure as its success in tablets came at the expense of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>powered netbooks which have virtually disappeared In the first quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips for tablets fell In past articles I have suggested a long position in INTC and a short position in QCOM made sense given their relative valuations and industry dynamics This thesis has held true over the past several years with an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>outperforming an investment in Qualcomm by a wide margin I have been bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since the stock traded in the mid teens but at this point Im on the sidelines I would like to see either resurgent growth in PCs which is unlikely or more shortterm success in mobile which I see as even less likely to take a long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at the moment I remain convinced the company is a solid holding for longer term investors and that the IoT market will emerge as a new growth pillar for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>over the next decade I see a somewhat similar path for Qualcomm as it yields to pressure from Chinese competitors in the applications processor space and to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in modems but carves out a substantial piece of the IoT market It is unclear who will be the ultimate winner in semiconductors Investors could either hold base positions in both if they must participate in semiconductors or avoid each name until the trends are better established For my money there is little compelling reason to be invested in either of these names today Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote
