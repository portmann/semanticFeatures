Reports circulating of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>getting a modem into iPhone Over the last couple of years there has been a lot of speculation about when chip giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC will finally get into Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhone Recently the chatter has perked up again with rumors of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>getting a modem into an upcoming Apple smartphone Until we actually see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>inside of the iPhone investors should remain lukewarm on the financial impact of Intels mobile prospects although the headline might be enough to move the stock The analyst at Cowen stated that supply chain evidence points to Apple using Intels modem as a second source for some SKUs of a forthcoming iPhone The analyst continued by saying that Apple would likely test the waters with this product on a lower end phone or tablet first likely aimed at nonUS and nonChinese geographies If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could gain of Apple modem volume the chip giant could see a boost to EPS of or more That would equate to a little more than of the adjusted earnings per share figure that analysts are looking for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to deliver this year but would essentially double the companys EPS growth Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is likely to give multiple EPS figures this year as it adjusts for expenses coming from the Altera acquisition While that headline EPS boost seems rather nice I remain a bit skeptical that it would happen First the analyst stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs of Apple modem volume but yet details how he only expects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to be contracted for certain models aimed at certain regions and most likely ones at the low end Until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>proves it has a top tier product here it seems unlikely that Apple will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a lot of business at first especially not with its flagship phones Additionally with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>trying desperately to get its foot in the door Im sure that the chip giant would be giving Apple a bit of a break on cost here Remember those contrarevenues that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>used to make inroads in the tablet business They really hurt the companys profitability and I figured wed see something similar here Dont forget Intels mobile efforts are included within the Client Computing Group which is Intels largest revenue segment meaning any progress will be buried in the results Before investors celebrate any potential Apple win another analyst on the street recently threw cold water on the news Stacy Rasgon stated the following when calling the reports extremely optimistic and perhaps unrealistic As to what we think about the reports in question Well we do believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>appears to be gunning for the socket and the general idea that AAPL might want to secondsource QCOM at some point seems plausible However for a variety of reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>capturing of AAPLs volume at this stage in the game seems extremely optimistic to us to wit Intels offerings appear underspecced they dont have CDMA they are manufactured on a worse process node raising the spectre of battery life Intels forward roadmap appears much worse that Qualcomms and Intels track record on mobile execution remains extremely spotty And such a large potential share loss appears inconsistent with Qualcomms commentary on chipset margin trajectory so we conclude that at least Qualcomm themselves do not foresee such a large loss forthcoming It has been nearly a year now since we first heard rumors of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>getting into the iPhone and perhaps things are finally happening However the financial impact would seem to be limited and I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will see a dramatic benefit to earnings per share Perhaps the more important part will be perception in terms of how investors see Intels mobile efforts With the chip giant being well behind in the tablet and smartphone race losing billions of dollars a year an Apple win should please shareholders In the end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to continue diversifying away from the PC business as one analyst recently stated that PCs are doing worse than expected so far this year
