long INTC MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Intels iGPU solutions are no longer a joke OEMs will find them costeffective solutions for laptops minicomputers and tablets Intels increasingly more competent integrated GPU technology could inspire PC OEMs to rely less on Nvidia and Radeons discrete video cards Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD should take notice that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC is hellbent on its mission to eliminate the need for discrete video cards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>confirmed at CES that it is developing a gaming NUC Next Unit of Computing with a quadcore thGeneration Skylake Core i and Iris Pro Integrated Graphics Processing Unit iGPU Skull Canyon is testament to Intels industryleading capability to miniaturize more powerful PC designs The skull logo of Skull Canyon echoes the trademark of the fictional hero The Punisher Skull Canyon could deliver serious punishment to AMD and Nvidias desktop and mobile GPU business The gamescentric Skull Canyons upcoming release essentially renders AMDs Project Quantum project dead The Project Quantum concept PC unveiled by AMD last year uses a NUCstyle design with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core i CPU coupled with a Radeon R Fury X video card However the Q tentative release of Skull Canyon leads me to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>not AMD will release a gamerfocused Mini PC this year Once Skull Canyons reference design is made available it is unlikely that Project Quantum will receive any serious consideration from PC manufacturers More advanced integrated GPU designs are essential to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and its PC OEM partners Intels high price tags per tray for its Core i products are justifiable considering they now come with more advanced integrated GPUs Instead of gaming laptops with discrete NvidiaRadeon cards OEMs could get away with similarperforming gaming notebooks exclusively using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Gen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>graphics for only Intels increasinglybetter iGPU lessens the necessity for a separate sub Radeon and GeForce video cards The Skull Canyon project could convince manufacturers to ship out midrange and highend computers without discrete video cards One less pricey component saves manufacturing cost A savings of by eliminating the discrete GPU allows for lower retail price tags A cheaper computer always improves its chances of finding more buyers A PC without discrete GPU also delivers better energyefficiency and heat dissipation Skull Canyons use of a quadcore Core CPU inside a tiny housing reveals Intels most powerful consumer processors are now less prone to overheating In my experience using the discreet GPU inside my gaming laptops even for nongaming activities is still a major factor towards overheating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is helping PC builders eliminate a major temperatureraising component inside portable and small computers The Iris Pro will be the first GT iGPU with Execution Units EU It could deliver significant performance improvement over the old GT Iris Pro which only has EUs The GT Iris Pro touts comparable GPU benchmark scores against AMD and Nvidias notebook GPUs Even under full HD x graphic tests the Iris Pro iGPU is already competitive Please study the chart below from Notebook Checknet The Iris Pro beats AMDs Radeon R laptop GPUs The Skull Canyon Iris Pro iGPU will likely compete better with Nvidias GeForce GTX mobile GPU series If not then the next generation of nm Iris Pro Graphics could do this I am confident <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to improve its integrated GPU technology to further enhance the attractiveness of its processors NUC is Intels platform for minicomputers that continues to see strong market success Equipping tiny PCs with more powerful CPUs and graphics processors is Intels preparation for the eventual death of desktoptower PC products Skull Canyon foretells a future where consumer and gamingcentric computers would all come in palmsized or smaller configurations Intels advances in integrated GPU design are not only for the pleasure of gamers too The GPU also serves as a hardware accelerator for software performance in computers Business users and creative professionals should appreciate that Intels Gen graphics now offer GPUbased hardware acceleration for media editingencoding Imaging software like Photoshop CC and AutoCAD could now also get a GPU boost from Intels integrated graphics Even Office and have GPU hardware acceleration My point is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should be congratulated for coming up with an iGPU with features that were previously only available from discrete video cards Intels increasingly better iGPU solutions are a longterm tailwind for the company Nvidia and AMDs GPU business could eventually get reduced to a niche market limited to video cards <span

fall headoverheels for the chance to use Apollo Lake inside gamesfriendly sub computers The integrated Gen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphics again boasts competitive GPU benchmark scores against mainstream Nvidia and AMD video cards There is no reason for OEMs to take notice of current AMD APUs because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is coming up with cheap thgeneration processors with outstanding GPU capabilities The current twogeneration older nm AMD APUs will remain unattractive compared to Intels nm processors Furthermore AMD recently confirmed that it can only probably release the highend version of its nm Zen CPUs this Q Zenbased APUs will only be available in Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
