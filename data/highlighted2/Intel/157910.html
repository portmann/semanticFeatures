Apple TV are expected to launch One of the mysteries of the September event just announced by Apple NASDAQ AAPL is why the huge venue San Franciscos Bill Graham Civic Auditorium At seats it more than doubles the capacity of previous iPhone events Are there really media people willing to travel to SF just to see the new iPhone and Apple TV This feels much bigger than what we Apple analysts have been assuming The launch of a new iPhone is a big deal I realize so maybe there really are people going to San Francisco to see it My sense is that there could be much more on the menu Not that iPhone wont still be center stage It will Ive discussed the forthcoming iPhone probably to be called iPhone s at length so despite its importance Ill tread lightly on the subject MacRumors has a good run down on iPs rumors The next iPhone will contain numerous improvements making it the best iPhone ever The system on chip SOC will be fabricated using Samsungs OTCSSNLF most advanced nm FinFET process making Apple only the second smartphone maker to use the process With an expected GB of RAM I believe that the Plus version will be fully capable of running the multitasking features Apple showed for iOS at WWDC Whether Apple will endow the iPhone with multitasking or reserve it exclusively for the next gen iPad remains to be seen but Im sure that multitasking is coming to the iPhone eventually Its too obvious a discriminator for Apple to pass up Many other components are getting upgraded including a new faster Qualcomm LTE modem capable of a breathtaking Mbsec download rate sorry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC fans better luck next time Also rumored are an upgraded Mpix camera capable of K video and Force Touch capable screen Recent leaked images of the new screen show a new IC that could be related to Force Touch Like many other Apple investors Ive been wanting Apple to get serious about its hobby for some time The need to do this has been clearly demonstrated by recent research results that showed Apple TV overtaken by Amazon NASDAQ AMZN in the US market for set top streaming devices The rumors about the next Apple TV have been predicated upon what would be required to make Apple TV competitive again the ability to run apps downloaded from an App Store a more powerful processor to run the apps such as the A from the current iP and a more capable remote to enable interaction with the apps It also appears that Siri will be a big part of the new Apple TV And by being a WiFi base station of sorts the new Apple TV will be able to provide centralized management and monitoring of any home automation devices based on Apples HomeKit standard So Apple will be able to establish a firm beachhead in the living room to compete with Amazon and even console makers such as Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Sony NYSE SNE As consumers increasingly rely on their smartphones and tablets for most personal computing needs the living room is becoming the last refuge of the nonmobile personal computer Integration with mobile devices will become an important discriminator and here Apple has the advantage Apple TV will be accessible from any iOS device as well as Apple Watch Siri based control will also be available through any iOS device The iOS Continuity feature will be extended to Apple TV as well Tasks and apps that are started on an iOS mobile device will become activated on the Apple TV if desired just by entering the room Previous generations of Apple TV were experiments iOS devices that werent quite the equal of even the iPhone The next generation promises to become much better integrated into the iOS ecosystem and play a pivotal role in the home Other up and coming stars of the Apple pantheon might put in cameo appearances such as the large screen iPad Pro But I really dont expect the Pro until October Here the issue is production capacity for the iPhone s SOC I expect the supply of SOCs to be somewhat limited until TSMC NYSE TSM comes on board as a second source to Samsung later in the year Until October I just dont think there will be enough of the nm parts to support both the new iPhones and new iPads We could also see an appearance by Apples Watch OS WOS and iOS have been in beta more or less in tandem since WWDC so WOS could roll out at the same time as the iPhone s simply because when the new iPhone is ready the new iOS will probably be ready as well Will the new iPhone and Apple TV be enough to galvanize investor support and keep the recent bounce in Apples share price going Probably not I know Oh cynical me But really when hasnt an iPhone launch been greeted with the utmost skepticism in the business media As soon as the event is over well be treated to a veritable avalanche of reasons why this next iPhone will flop The processor is too slow The camera doesnt have enough pixels The screen isnt bright or colorful enough Most importantly the novelty of the big screen has worn off The bloom is off the rose Apple has had its day in the sun Weve all heard it before Many are realizing that China had been turned into just another bogeyman with which to scare Apple investors Despite this I dont expect the media negativity about Apple to abate until the fiscal Q earnings report at the earliest I expect the real turnaround to be in January of when Apple reports December quarter results Despite the fact that a new iPhone and Apple TV form a very credible basis for a special event I cant escape the feeling that Im missing something The size of the venue makes me suspicious that Apple has some big surprise planned Ive been wracking my brain trying to come up with a possible new product Apple Car Naaah waaay too far in the future If Apple even has a rolling test bed Im sure its nothing they want to show at a special event The only other thing I can think of might have something to do with virtualaugmented reality Apple is known to have been hiring engineers to work in the field Apple is also known to have obtained a patent for VR goggles that would use an iPhone as the display unit I dont know that the patent would really serve as the basis of a viable product but it shows where Apple wants to go Apple wants to build on the iPhone as a highly capable portable computing device with very capable graphics and a retina caliber display VR goggles have a geeky lack of coolness that is very unApple so I cant see Apple getting serious about such a device With augmented reality goggles such as the Microsoft HoloLens the device at least has the potential to eventually become something people would wear in public without embarrassment If Apple could develop augmented reality glasses that were actually inconspicuous it would have a huge
