enterprise market Unlike Samsung which will only use the Snapdragon on some versions of the Galaxy S Microsoft again went Snapdragon for its new flagship Lumia phones Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM stock definitely benefited from the recent news that Samsung OTC SSNLF will use the Snapdragon next year for some models of its upcoming Galaxy S I also expect that Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT exclusive use of Snapdragons on its new flagship Lumia handsets would also inspire more bulls to rally around QCOM The Microsoft Lumia Windows phone has the hexacore Snapdragon and the Lumia XL has the octacore Snapdragon v These two Windows phones are likely to be available for purchase this last quarter of Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is already listing accessories for these two Windows smartphones The commercial launch might therefore happen sooner than we expect A comparative specs sheet reveals these two Lumia phones are geared toward affluent customers and enterprise clients This is great because Microsoft has a bigger clout than Samsung on the US enterprise market I expect the Lumia and XL phones to be play an important role in selling more Snapdragon and Snapdragon processors Microsofts ambitious pricing for the inch Lumia XL puts it in direct competition with the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone S Plus and the Google NASDAQ GOOGL Nexus P Slapping a price tag showed Microsoft is confident enough to go toe to toe against the most expensive phablets Apple is no doubt the undisputed champion when it comes to selling luxury gadgets However judging by Microsofts pricey Surface Book laptop and new Lumia flagship phones Nadella is only too willing to scrap it out with Apples most expensive products While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC benefits from Microsofts move to become a highend laptop vendor Qualcomm is the derivative beneficiary of Microsofts aggressive push toward highend Windows highend phones The two Snapdragonpowered Lumia phones are fully compatible with Continuum for Phones These makes them great alternatives to the Pocket PC concept of the Acer Jade Primo The Jade Primo also has Snapdragon inside it Microsoft and Acers Windows Mobile OS highend phones could all function as desktop computers when docked to a monitor or TV set The Microsoft Display Dock transforms Windows phones into useful office computers Microsoft made efforts to code its mobile Office apps and Outlook scale properly to give people real desktop PClike productivity when using a Windows smartphone Continuum is a killer feature of Windows phones that Apple or Samsung will find hard to match Those two lack industrystandard software that is as powerful and famous as Microsofts Office I therefore expect more enterprise clients to favor the Lumia and Lumia XL over other highend smartphones that cannot function as pocket computers Small and medium businesses will appreciate the cost savings of buying just a Snapdragonpowered Windows phone instead of replacing their entire set of older desktop PCs QCOM is a Buy Im now convinced this ARMbased fabless semiconductor company has a solid lock on Lumia phones The economic benefits of Microsofts move toward selling highend phones is easy to comprehend Instead of just supplying entrylevel chips like the Snapdragon for sub Lumia phones Qualcomm will now be able to ride Microsofts big need to sell its highend Windows phones Microsoft sold tens of millions of its Lumia phones last year However most of them are of the budget variety Microsoft finally realized that its bad business to sell cheap Windows phones at a loss Unlike Google Microsoft still lacks the mobile advertising platform to make selling dirtcheap hardware a winning proposition Microsoft is therefore moving toward higherpriced phones Qualcomm will supply Microsoft the necessary flagshipworthy Snapdragons to make nextgeneration Lumia smartphones remain competitive versus the best Apple and Samsung phones Qualcomm shareholders would only truly appreciate Microsofts loyalty once more highermargin Snapdragons gets inside premium phones The margin on a Snapdragon v is obviously higher than that of the Snapdragon Editors Note This
