class='textDiv'>Apple The Sleeping Giant Goes To War Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apples March quarter results were about what I expected Apples June quarter guidance was below my expectations Apples NASDAQ AAPL March quarter earnings came in just about as I expected but the June quarter guidance was not pretty However the guidance and earnings call comments reveal much about the impact of the iPhone SE much of it good in the long run To defend the iOS ecosystem Apple is being forced to slug it out with competitors in a bruising price war With a cash horde of billion its a war Apple can afford to fight and win The fundamental message of the earnings report guidance is that the days of high margins both gross and operating are over for now Apple guided to a much lower gross margin of percent compared to the March quarters Given the operating expense guidance of about billion this puts operating margin at about assuming that Apple gets close to its high end revenue guidance of billion This is a steep drop from Apples customary operating margin It seems to me that most analysts havent fully processed what the guidance means Most analysts are so accustomed to thinking about Apple as a high margin niche player that they cant imagine it doing anything else Under this assumption perhaps the expectation of the bears is reasonable When confronted with what they viewed as the inevitable assault of just as good commodity smartphones they expected Apple to retreat into the elitist isolationism that characterized Apple in the late s Things are so much different from back then Apple is not on the verge of bankruptcy and its production costs are much closer to its competitors It also has significant technological advantages in its operating systems and custom designed processors Most importantly it has a large billion ecosystem of Mac OS iOS tvOS and watchOS users Apple is now faced with competition from very capable smartphones from Samsung OTCSSNLF Huawei and Xiaomi Private XI that are priced at the midtier but are very competitive in performance Huawei has imitated Apple in producing its own custom designed processor the Kirin for use in its top end phones While not quite as good as Apples A in the iPhone s its very good The processors in the Samsung and Xiaomi flagships use the Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon which is at least as good as the A if not better Apple might have decided to simply wait out the June quarter assuming that the iPhone would once again restore its supremacy The processor in iP will undoubtedly leapfrog the competition but its unclear that Apple or any of its competitors can achieve permanent advantage The impact of iPhone SE provided a tipping point in Apples thinking As Apple management acknowledged in the conference call demand for the SE was much stronger than expected The SE demonstrated that demand was much more elastic Moving to what was for Apple an unprecedented low price point stimulated demand more than expected While margins are undoubtedly lower for the SE I dont doubt that its still profitable The SE showed that Apple could grow down market profitably without sacrificing user experience or cheapening the brand or its products The SE provided a path forward through the competitive landscape but it would mean a dramatic change in profitability at least in the near term I was like most people a little surprised and disheartened by the June quarter guidance Before I get to an analysis of the guidance let me just summarize the comparison of the March quarter results with my expectations before the earnings release As the reader can see I got fairly close in most estimates And I scored a bulls eye in RD expense I had modeled billion and it came in at billion As I expected operating margin declined as Apple continues to invest in RD expansion while trimming costs slightly in SGA Moving on to the June guidance in the conference call Apple pointed to a number of factors for the revenue decline including macro headwinds foreign exchange headwinds the impact of SE sales lower margins and a billion channel inventory drawdown Not mentioned is the impact of competitive pressure from some very good smartphones from Samsung LG HTC Xiaomi and Huawei Well one wouldnt expect Apple to highlight this in their earnings call but its clearly a major factor especially in the yy revenue decline in Greater China for the March quarter My reading of the guidance and the billion channel inventory drawdown is that this is very much reflective of the mix shift to the SE The SE is in effect cannibalizing sales of the more expensive iPhone The cannibalization is mostly temporary as I expect the iP to be discontinued once iPhone is released in September The billion drawdown is clearing the channel of iP Plus inventory in anticipation of the iP When iP is released and iP discontinued the iPhone lineup will make more sense There will be sizes of iPhone all running the A processor and available at significant discounts compared to the iPhone Based on Apples guidance Ive prepared an early preliminary estimate of June quarter results Ive incorporated the impact of the SE and the new inch iPad Pro In the conference call Cook indicated that iPad could have the best revenue compare in over two years This implies sales of about million units I consider this credible in light of Intels discontinuance of contra revenue and the steep decline in tablet processors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shipped last quarter down yy Ive always said that I felt this was a major factor in the iPad sales decline so removing this pressure can be expected to be beneficial One thing I want to point out is that Im still booking continued growth in RD sequentially I believe the predictions of massive layoffs at Apple are simply ridiculous Apple is expanding the RD workforce for a very good reason and will continue to do so especially as Campus II nears completion There may be slowing of hiring but not across the board layoffs Apple will be testing new lows in operating margin in the June quarter In the past when Apples margins dropped in to the midtwenty percent range such as in the market was not happy and Apples share price suffered In fiscal Q Apples operating margin will be even lower so there really isnt any reason to expect a recovery in share price for the June quarter I think the probability is high that Apples share price will only go lower And of course there will be a nonstop litany of bearish predictions about Apple that wont help The price war could be long and bloody and will undoubtedly test the patience of Apple investors Its going to take time for investors to adjust to the new reality of Apples margins Despite the negative impact on share price lowering margins and becoming more price competitive is something that Ive long advocated Were already hearing in the media that the decline of the iPhone was inevitable Thats not what was inevitable What was inevitable was that Apple would come to this juncture faced with having to compete on price Under the circumstances I still recommend the stock as a buy but with the caveat of investing for a long term year investment time frame I believe the stock probably has further to drop I think it will be an even better bargain by midSummer and plan to hold off on purchases until then Im perfectly comfortable holding the stock and have no concerns about Apples long term viability I remain long Apple Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL QCOM I wrote this
