Time To Buy Defense Stocks Cramers Mad Money Seeking Alpha Nov AM ET Includes AAPL ACM AGN APD ARG COST CP CS EOG FIT GD GM GNC GPRO GS INTC JACK LMT MSFT NOC NSC OXY PRGO RTN SFM SHLD ULTA by SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Today is the day when many stocks that had been languishing or puttering or just plain going down finally awoke from their slumber and regained their gusto as part of a broader move higher said Cramer One such stock was Apple NASDAQ AAPL which rallied on Wednesday when GoldmanSachs NYSE GS upgraded it to convictionbuy list as Apple can now be viewed as a service provider which can benefit for many years due to its huge install base Some time back Apple was downgraded by Credit Suisse on the pretext of inventory checks by their Asian team However reports from an Apple supplier said that sales are strong For the record I like hearing from Tim Cooks Asia team a lot more than the Asia team of UBS or Credit Suisse or whatever other firm might convince you to trade Apple and not own it said Cramer Apple trades at just times earnings which is way less than the average stock in the SP which is like some metalbending auto parts company according to Cramer At the level set by Goldman Sachs Apple will trade more like an aerospace parts company which makes Cramer happy The same case applied to Allergan NYSE AGN Costco NASDAQ COST and Jack in the Box NASDAQ JACK where investors are willing to buy highquality companies after looking at them more objectively After today maybe the bottom line is that the markets loveydovey stock list the ones that are anointed by big money managers is expanding back to companies that have delivered great results said Cramer One of the fastest growing enterprise software companies Salesforce reported a great last quarter by beating estimates posting higher than expected revenue and raising fullyear guidance Cramer interviewed founder chairman and CEO Marc Benioff It wasnt that long ago that I was sitting here with you and we were talking about our first billion year Now I am so excited to announce that next year we will do more than billion and we are still the fastest growing enterprise software company ever said Benioff There is almost B deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the company has won some major contracts The company had great deals with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC General Motors NYSE GM Sprouts Framers Market NASDAQ SFM and one of the biggest engineering companies Aecom NYSE ACM When asked about his relationship with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Benioff said that they are a partner rival and friendly competitor Fitbit NYSE FIT vs GoPro NASDAQ GPRO Fitbit is often called the next GoPro as both had huge IPOs and became controversial later Both are in the wearable technology business driven by software along with many other similarities The important factor is that both companies received approval for quicker lockup expiration Cramer took a deep look at each company individually to find out which is better to invest in Fitbits stock has fallen from its highs due to the secondary offering Fitbit is offering M shares of which M are from existing shareholders to raise capital in order to invest in RD which means the company is interested in gaining market share and solidifying its position GoPro on the other hand sold stocks worth M to establish a charitable trust Giving half a billion dollars to charity is a wonderful thing to do no question but this show is about helping individual investors try to make money And having insiders dump that much stock on the open market was very bad news for GoPros shareholders said Cramer The current time is a lot like the s when President Ronald Reagan also advocated a military buildup that led to the rise in defense stocks Im not trying to be a warmonger or a fearmonger or a profiteer but I have to wonder do we even have enough aircraft carriers to do all of those things Do we have enough planes Do we have enough missiles Do we have enough soldiers in the right places asked Cramer The US could be overstretched Im not advocating a political position here Im simply giving you my bestguess prediction about something that could be very important to your portfolio Because if I am right then you need to know what happened in since it could play out all over again said Cramer This means that the defense stocks like Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT to Raytheon NYSE RTN to General Dynamics NYSE GD and Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC should be bought Norfolk Southerns NYSE NSC takeover bid Should Norfolk Southern NSC accept the per share takeover bid by Canadian Pacific NYSE CP or should they hold on for a higher price Cramer reminded about the deal where Air Products bid for Airgas NYSE ARG for which was eventually rejected by CEO Peter McCausland Airgas now got more yesterday and they accepted GNC Holdings NYSE GNC Buy Perrigo NYSE PRGO and not GNC Jim Cramers Action
