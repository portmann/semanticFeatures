<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Trying To Hide Its Mobile Troubles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has changed its financial reporting structure again Mobile group is being merged with PC group After the bell on Monday we received some interesting news from chip giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC The company announced that it would be changing its financial reporting structure beginning with the release of its Q report Normally this news wouldnt have been that big but it basically represents a degree turn from what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did just a year earlier In this article I look at the latest news and see if the chip giant is trying to hide its mobile troubles When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced Q earnings the company had five reporting operating segments PC Client Group Data Center Group Other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture operating segments Software and services operating segments and All other Just a few months later prior to the Q report the company announced that it was changing its financial reporting structure At this time the company announced a new operating segment the Mobile and Communications Group This segment included the Phone Group Tablet Group and MultiComm all of which were previously in the Other IA operating segment In the April release the company stated the following The company will revise the presentation of its operating segments to reflect changes in our organizational model which are aligned with our critical objectives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fell behind in the tablet race and has been working to play catch up in recent years The Mobile Group has seen some terrible results lately reporting a billion operating loss in after a billion operating loss a year earlier The group reported a paltry million in revenues last year after nearly billion in While the tablet and smartphone space is a large one that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cant ignore many wonder if the company is wasting too much money trying to get its foot in the door <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did ship million tablet chips in above its million goal but the losses did pile up The hope for this year was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could reduce its mobile segment operating losses by million That gets me to the companys most recent announcement where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has decided to again change its financial reporting structure The following statements are from the press release announcing the news The company will revise the presentation of its operating segments to reflect the combination of the PC Client Group and the Mobile and Communications Group to create the Client Computing Group The new group was created to address all aspects of the client computing market segment and utilize Intels intellectual property to offer compelling customer solutions Actual results will be reported with the firstquarter earnings report At that time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will also provide commentary on the companys goal to improve mobile profitability by million in There are two key points to think about here The first part is the smaller one and thats the goal to improve mobile profitability by million this year One has to wonder if the company is failing to meet that goal because I would think if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was ahead of the goal it wouldnt have changed its reporting structure Even though the segment would still be showing losses I would think the company would want to highlight progress being made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did warn about Q revenues so it is possible that results in the segment are not coming in as expected The second part is the more major one in my opinion and that is the thought process about the Mobile Group in general By merging the segment with the PC Client Group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can essentially hide its massive losses for the segment In the PC Client Group had more than billion in operating profits and almost billion in revenues The Mobile Groups revenues last year would be almost a rounding error in this new segment although the operating loss would be a bit more meaningful While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to provide an update on the million goal at the Q report what happens at reports after that The company may not discuss the matter again and may not answer any analyst questions on the issue I recently applauded Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA for its decision to become more transparent with the investment community In that sense I am a little disappointed with Intels decision to merge these two business segments and become less transparent If the mobile segment is doing poorly it will be an unwelcome sign for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bulls Just last month I noted how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares had rallied on a rumor of a potential Apple NASDAQ AAPL win to get a modem into an iPhone in Those that are fans of the chip giant were looking for the mobile segment to become a major revenue driver for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the next couple of years If that were to be the case you would think the segment would have its own line in Intels results not merged in with a much larger PC group Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>may decide to change its reporting segments again next year In the end Intels recent financial reporting structure change leaves some interesting questions to be answered It was just a year ago that the company broke out the Mobile and Communications Group in its results Now that segment has been merged into a new segment that includes the massive PC segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will provide an update on its million mobile profitability improvement goal at its upcoming earnings report One must wonder if that news will be negative especially after the recent revenue warning Im a big fan of companies being more transparent with the investment community Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing just the opposite here with a segment that is supposed to be very important moving forward Source Is <span
