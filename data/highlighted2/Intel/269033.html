nm FinFET process AMD will finally release nm CPUs and GPUs next year On the other hand Intels upcoming entrylevel nm Apollo Lake processors will again hurt AMDs lowendmidrange PC business in Apollo Lake processors will have Gen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD graphics that have support for Ultra HD K video resolution and GPU hardware acceleration After being stuck in nm process for so long Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD confirmed last month that it would release nm processors and GPUs next year GlobalFoundries nm FinFET technology will help AMD catch up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC in Intelmade nm processors were already in commercial products since September INTC greatly outperformed AMDs stock over the past two years because of AMDs failure to keep up with Intels rate of advancement in processor manufacturingdesigns This stock performance trend might still continue well into because of Intels upcoming Apollo Lake processors Without upgrading to nm AMD may incur more unsold inventories of outdated nm chips AMD had to write down million over unsold processors during its recent quarterly earnings report We all look forward to AMDs nextgeneration nm desktopmobile processors However the Digitimes report that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will release cheap Apollo Lakebased processors in mid spells trouble for the upcoming nm CPUAPU products of AMD The nm Carizzo and CarizzoL SoC from AMD this year were never competitive with Intels nm BroadwellU and Skylake processors It is the reason why AMD had no choice but to skip nm and nm and go directly to nm so it could achieve parity with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The nm Apollo Lakebased <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors will reportedly come with the new Gen HD graphics technology Intels Gen integrated GPU supports Ultra HD K x resolution and Hardware Acceleration for Media Editing This is a very important equalizer to the oftenbetter integrated Radeon GPUs of AMD processors While many gamers will probably prefer cheap AMD Radeonpowered desktops future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Apollo Lakeequipped PCs may win favor from creative professionals who want an Integrated GPU with Hardware Acceleration support for Photoshop or Premiere The highend Skylake Core iK is the first product that uses the Integrated Gen GPU the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Intels Generation integrated GPU IGP now has a Multi Plane Overlay feature This is similar to AMD Radeons D renderingvideo playback path adjustments technology used in the Carizzo SoC I wont bother you with numerous technical improvements that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made for Gen GPU What matters most is that DigiTimes is now claiming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is coming up with cheap x processors that could compete with the builtin Radeon GPUs of AMD APUs This enhanced GPU feature is important because PC manufacturers will then have little reason to support Radeonpowered APUs A Gen Graphicspowered Apollo Lake CPU will make it possible for PC vendors like Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY to come up with decent sub computers My point is that Intels integrated GPUs are now good enough for most PC vendors This is why Intels IGP has helped it corner share of the overall GPU industry Thanks to widespread OEM support <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has more than market share in desktop processor sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD Graphicsequipped entrylevel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs are most likely beating sales of Radeonpowered APUs Intels Gen integrated GPUs might even be good enough for budgetconstrained PC gamers There are millions of PC buyers that cannot afford a Radeon or Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA graphics card Going forward there might be little need for people to buy NvidiaRadeon GPUs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is plotting to release sub Apollo Lakebased processors with an IGP that could play any modern PC games under lowmedium graphic settings As per the tests of Digital Trends the Gen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD has a better DMark Benchmark score than AMDs Godavari AK APU The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>HD is faster than the excellent Radeon integrated GPU of the AK Like what the chart above revealed the budgetfriendly Apollo Lake could really eventually hurt the sales of sub budget APUs and discreet GPU products of AMD and Nvidia The huge pool of buyers of lowend computers means there is money to be made in lowermargin Apollo Lakebased processors Anything that will encourage people to keep on buying affordable desktop and laptops is good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I also see energyefficient Apollo Lake processors getting inside sub in tabletnotebook products next year Unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AMD has so far avoided the in notebook products Investors should therefore include <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and not AMD in their portfolio Gen GPUequipped Apollo Lakebased processors will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>erode AMDs market share in lowtomidrange computers Sad but true its the PC manufacturers not the endconsumers who actually decide which new x processor designs get to thrive or die Yes AMD will come up with great nm processors next year that have amazing benchmark scores However Intels dominant influence over PC OEMs means AMDs Zen products will probably again get weak industry support Sad but true PC OEMs who kowtow to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are slowly killing AMDs x PC processor business Unless Dr Lisa Su can persuade major PC vendors like Lenovo to support AMDs upcoming Zenbased processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to enjoy market share in x CPU sales Lastly Intels continuing improvement of its integrated graphics processing IGP technology also is a headwind for AMDs discreet Radeon GPU sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>therefore is the safer bet for investing Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be
