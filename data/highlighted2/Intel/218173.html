quarter let me turn the call over to our CEO Ford Tamer Ford Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Thanks John Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for our Q earnings call Q was another very solid quarter for Inphi and we are pleased to deliver these results to our shareholders We are announcing record nonGAAP revenue of million for the quarter which represents yearoveryear and sequential increases respectively Our nonGAAP gross margin remained strong at We are also announcing record nonGAAP operating margin of million or and nonGAAP EPS of which is a increase over our EPS one year ago Our free cash flow this quarter was a record million bringing our overall cash and shortterm investment balance to million On the product and customer fronts this was a busy quarter for Inphi To walk you through the events of the quarter let me return to our familiar FedEx planes trains and trucks analogy to describe Inphis data movement interconnect progress Starting with planes our optical interconnects for the longhaul and metro market In late September we attended the annual European Conference on Optical Communications or ECOC show There we announced the sampling of a new surface mount linear driver This is an adaptation of our very successful quad linear driver in a more cost effective packaged designed for higher volume Gigabit and Gigabit coherent applications We developed this surface mount package to meet our longhaul and metro customers significant existing need for higher density and lower cost solutions We are also seeing increased customer traction with our new Gigabaud optical interconnect product family We are confident that both the surface mount and the Gigabaud Amplifier and Driver product will contribute to our revenue growth in Moving onto trains Our networking interconnects within the data center Also at ECOC we showcased the worlds first Gigabit Gigabit Gigabit and Gigabit Ethernet PAM Solutions for cloud interconnect By doubling the bits transmitted at the same baud rate PAM is now recognized as the preferred modulation method for more efficient optical and copper interconnects both within the data center and between data centers Inphis PAM Gigabit dual lambda technology was demonstrated at ECOC and is ready and available for designers to build line cards and modules today for nextgeneration data center platforms of tomorrow We remain confident that our networking interconnect solutions will continue to ramp in driven by our Gigabit and Gigabit physical layer devices our clockdata recovery or CDR and the many PAM designs currently underway for Gigabit Gigabit Gigabit and Gigabit And finally the portion of our business that correlates to trucks is our memory interconnects inside server and systems There we remain ready and well position to regain share Specifically this quarter we announced sampling of the secondgeneration of DDR registers and buffers which consume less power while allowing DRAM to run up to megatransfers per second with increased capacity Because of this increased performance and reliability we anticipate strong market acceptance continued market share gains and revenue ramp in the first half of and continuing through mid While announcements are key indicators of Inphis progress what really matters is how our customers react Our module system OEM and data center customers expressed robust interest and demand in our new optical networking and memory interconnect products With that you can see that in Q our planes trains and trucks continue to roll along on track delivering data faster and further As we progress through the fourth quarter and look ahead I am pleased with our product positioning in the various markets We remain confident in our outlook driven by a resumption of the business in China and our multiple new product introductions I offer a sincere thank you to the strong team here at Inphi that is working x to make all this possible Now let me turn the call over to John for a discussion of the financial results And I look forward to addressing any questions you might have at the end of this call John John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Thanks Ford Now let me recap the financial results for Q As Ford mentioned in the third quarter of Inphi reported revenues of million which was up yearoveryear by approximately The nine months yeartodate revenue was million on a nonGAAP basis which also represented yearoveryear growth While this growth was due in part to the October acquisition of Cortina even when we add the Cortina and Gig SerDes business for this first nine months of the year into the base the core communications business continued to show approximately organic yearoveryear growth and we expect that growth to continue through Q of this year We define our core communications as Amplifiers and Drivers as well as Gig Gig and Gig physical interface products Our communications business continues to represent roughly of our total revenues through Q The core communications products continue to represent to of communications while the legacy communications products represented the remaining to As was the case in Q in Q we continue to see some strength in transport and legacy revenues relative to expectations As expected in Q sales of product into highspeed memory applications were up sequentially as sales of DDR products grew on top of sales of DDR which remained relatively strong We expect sales of our DDR products to keep growing into Q This should bring us to revenues for the year in highspeed memory in the range of million to million Gross margins on a nonGAAP basis came in at slightly ahead of where we expected and including approximately of IP licensing revenue in the quarter Based on the current forecasted mix for Q and an ongoing stream of IT licensing revenue we expect the gross margins in Q to be in the range of to On a GAAP basis we were closer to breakeven in GAAP operating income in Q now at a loss as compared to Q when we had a million operating loss The delta between GAAP and nonGAAP is approximately million made up of five basic adjustments As discussed previously the GAAP loss includes stock compensation expense of million purchase accounting related adjustments totaling million as well as some acquisition transition expenses which were shortterm retention bonuses of million that were part of the purchase agreement Finally we also had related tax effects to these additional expenses along with valuation allowance adjustments and other tax charges totaling million tax benefit all netting to million of additional expense in the GAAP books The Q GAAPbased result a loss of million or per share compares to a net loss of million or per share in Q of The Q GAAP net loss was negative more as a result of interperiod tax allocation between the quarters throughout A more telling comparison was the GAAP pretax loss of a year ago of million which now compares to Q of GAAP pretax loss of just The more current Q number also included million of largely purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Cortina In fact this is what we would see on a nonGAAP basis about a million improvement in net income from the third quarter of and million for the third quarter of at million Now for further clarification and analysis of the operating results lets turn to some additional nonGAAP measures and comparisons As I just said on a nonGAAP basis the net income for the third quarter of was million or per diluted share which was up slightly and consistent with the nonGAAP net income of million or per share in Q of NonGAAP operating expense for the quarter totaled million This was up million from the previous quarter as expected Again in Q and Q we have reverted to a higher level of customer cofunding for RD reflected as an offset to RD expense This is serving to offset a higher program spend on certain projects which on a net basis still drove expenses higher by approximately in Q and will drive incremental spending up higher in Q by an estimated As in customer cofunding of RD will continue into but its expected to be somewhat less and will again vary by quarter Overall in Q we were able to deliver an operating income margin of In Q with slightly higher gross margins and slightly higher operating spending we believe we can deliver operating margin in the range of to With regard to the nonGAAP tax provision in Q consistent with Q we are currently expecting approximately which does not include the benefit of a restoration of the federal RD tax credit for In fiscal when the RD credit was restored in Q our nonGAAP effective tax rate for the year dropped to approximately We are uncertain whether the credit will be restored again in the fourth quarter of this year To affect fourth quarter reporting then would depend on the bill passing through the US Congress before the end of the calendar year Now turning to the balance sheet Overall cash was up million in the quarter from million to million This was due to strong cash flow from operations in Q of million up from a comparable cash flow from operations in Q of million The improvement is largely due to favorable changes in the working capital which generated about million The company also had capital expenditures of million which was up as expected from the million in Q This also allowed us to generate million of free cash flow which is up and consistent with the million in free cash flow we generated in Q We continue to expect a similar level of cash expenditures in Q of Accounts receivable came in at million or days sales outstanding as compared to million or days sales outstanding at the end of June Inventory on the balance sheet at the end of September was million which included million of acquisitionrelated stepup in inventory value as compared to million at the end of June which included million of stepup in inventory value Excluding the relative stepup in inventories inventory days was down to days or four turns at the end of September compared to days or about turns at the end of June The inventory balance is still a bit higher than normal due to a variety of reasons which weve covered in the past We continue to work on bringing the inventory balance down over time Payables decreased to million or days in September from million or days outstanding at the end of June due largely to the timing of inventory receipts in the quarter Now let me recap the business outlook for Q I remind everyone again that the following statements are based on current expectations as of today and include forwardlooking statements Actual results may differ materially We do not plan to update nor do we take on any obligation to update this outlook in the future Our forecast of Q revenues is in a range of up approximately to up or million to million We expect nonGAAP gross margins to be in a range of to We expect nonGAAP operating expense to be in a range of million to million We are currently estimating the nonGAAP effective tax rate to be for the year again this does not reflect or include a potential reduction if Congress renews the federal RD credit during the fourth quarter We are confident these components should then align resulting in nonGAAP operating margin between and This should then lead to nonGAAP net income of between million and million which on approximately million estimated diluted shares would result in estimated nonGAAP earnings of between and per diluted share We also estimate stockbased compensation expense to be between million and million In addition we expect about million from purchase accountingbased adjustments In Q we also have another quarter of flowthrough of steppedup inventory value estimated at about and we expect about in acquisition transitionbased expenses This would imply a GAAP net loss in the range of to million GAAP loss per share would then be a loss in the range of to per share A more complete reconciliation of the Q GAAP net income forecast is attached to the last page of the press release We will not update this outlook during the quarter until the time of the next quarterly earnings release unless Inphi publishes a notice stating otherwise so please ask any questions you may have today during the general QA period Hey guys Congratulations on the nice results and outlook Ford lots of excitement it sounds like around the PAM opportunity all the way from Gig all the way up to Gig Now that youve got another quarter under your belt youre recently back from the ECOC show can you give us a sense what the PAM ramp timing looks like as you come through or Gig and Gig singlelaser opportunities still most likely the first to ramp or do you see opportunities for Gig modules getting pulled in And then Ive got a couple of followups Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Thanks Quinn So you are right Gig and Gig will be first to ramp followed by Gig and thats going to be in the second half of and we expect the Gigabit to ramp in the first half of Having said this I do want to put this in context We look at overall Gigabit ramp for our business We could discuss the long haul and metro at some point In the data center we have our original Inphi Gigabit organic businesses which is the CDR and the Gearbox and thats still growing strong and expected to keep growing in We also have a new lowpower CDR that is being rolled out into four lambda CWDM application and we expect that to ramp along with the Silicon Photonic Gigabit module partner for enterprise in a big way in as well as both DML and EMLbased Gigabit modules for cloud data centers in the second half of So Gigabit story includes many driver one of which is PAM and were still very confident on PAM and had some good qualification progress in field trial in the third quarter Great And then just a sort of followup on that commentary If I look at the Laser and Driver business to date I think its mostly been driven by the long haul or metro coherent applications And if Im correct you have fairly small revenue today from Drivers and Amplifiers in the Datacom G Datacom modules is that correct And if that is correct as you look into how big could that Datacom module be for the Laser Drivers and CDRs and Amplifiers Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Quinn that is correct So our business today on the Amplifier and Driver is up over longhaul metro We do expect a platform solution bundled with our PAM offering to come to market in the second half and thats where we are excited about and that could be a significant opportunity for us We have not yet quantified it but we are confident that this will allow us to reach our revenue goals for next year Great And then just switching over to the memory interface market One of your newer competitors that market recently announced that they had some technical issues and therefore were going to miss the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>call cycle Can you give us any updates that youve seen on the competitive front as we prepare for the next platform ramp server platform ramp from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>next year Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Yes We continue to gain share So we have said on the prior call we will double our revenue in the second half of and we are doing what we said we would do so our revenue is on track to double from the first half of to the second half of And were also on track to continue to gain share and double again in and continue to gain share through the mid so were still confident in our the statements that we made in the past Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley Your line is now open Please go ahead Joe L Moore Morgan Stanley Co LLC Great Thank you I wonder if you can just talk a little about the service provider environment You alluded to the slowness in China that you saw in Q and that that will get better next year Can you what do you see there in Q Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Yes Thank you Joe We have seen a resumption of the China demand The big pause there was the Phase of the China mobile deployment which impacted us and some other vendor And what weve seen is now increased customer demand especially for our Gigabit coherent amplifiers And we believe this will continue through Q and into next year Joe So we think the delay was a temporary situation and were excited about the growth that this could mean for us moving forward especially combined with some of the latest Infonetics report that are indicating a growth in coherent ports yearonyear from to Joe L Moore Morgan Stanley Co LLC Great Thank you And then separately can you talk a little bit about Gig Gig adoption in the data center and how sensitive you are to the timing around that adoption over the course of the next year Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director So if you look at the latest corporate presentation that weve uploaded to our website we are now forecasting a small delay in ramp So weve taken the number down from K Gigabit port in down to K ports and thats based on a Crehan Research report that we can forward to you But the good news is then the same Crehan Research report is more bullish on that adoption in and bringing the numbers up actually in and Most of our revenue for the new lowpower CDR and the new PAM offering and the accompanying amplifier and driver were assumed to be second half for us anyhow So the delay we believe is about a quarter and for us its not as big of an impact Its a small impact to the second half but it could actually play in our favor because it reduces the time from introduction to the time our products are available by about a quarter which could play to our advantage Yeah hi nice results This is Eric calling in for Tore I wanted to follow up with some of the questions earlier on your memory interface business It sounds like thats coming along as youd planned and even a little bit higher the range you gave for calendar year What do you think is your current share of that market and how does this look exiting the year and into next year John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President So Eric this is John I think right now we believe we have probably around of the register side of the DDR market and were gaining that share into the back half of this year And wed expect to be able to get to somewhere around share next year and then a full share sometime in as Sky Lake launches Great So obviously then youre getting good feedback from the Gen product On the PAM besides your largest customer who was kind of in the midst of or largest competitors in the midst of being kind of acquired are you seeing anybody else on the competitive front Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Yes actually the largest competitors are the ones not making noise Theyre actually a range of smaller companies mostly private that are actually either partners or competitors Theyre actually mostly partners So weve got a range of private companies that we are partnering with to take this to market and we are weve got one major competitor thats also a private company that you probably know who Im referring to Thank you Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch Your line is now open Vivek Arya Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner Smith Inc Thanks for taking my question Maybe Ford to start with I think you mentioned that you were seeing some improved demand from the China business I know its probably a little early But how sustainable do you think this recovery is Because we have seen in price cycles where there is a deployment over a couple of quarters and then there is absorption of all that capacity So just conceptually how is your visibility as you look out into the first half of next year Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Vivek if I could predict a macro I probably would not be sitting on this call But I think from where we sit today we feel confident that Phase of the China mobile infrastructure has resumed So based on the data we have today were seeing obviously orders flowing back And the good news the inventory levels were fairly low so were going to see a direct impact into Q and Q We at this point were calling this going back to normal so were not we believe that this Phase has been approved and moving forward But thats the data we have today I mean itd be hard for us to say that it may not stop again in six months And we dont have that visibility unfortunately As of today its moving forward Vivek Arya Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner Smith Inc Understand And maybe Ford as a followup so next year there are expectations that the number of base station deployments may go down Could you help us understand I assume that youre probably a little bit more tied to say backhaul and the core of the network and then the metro network rather than base stations and radios per se is that a fair assumption So can you still benefit even if the number of base stations goes down but just because there are more subscribers coming on theres a need for greater capacity So there are parts of the network where they will still need to spend Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Vivek youre right on We are more tied to the number of subscriber as we are to the number of base station We really are predominantly a backhaul type of story So the predominant revenue we get from the infrastructure business is really our driver and TIA business and that is tied to really long haul and metro type offerings which are directly correlated to number of subscriber as opposed to number of base station Vivek Arya Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner Smith Inc Got it One last one as a very quick housekeeping If John you could give us some color around the relative sequential growth for your comms memory and IP business in Q and if you have some color for us on how IP could trend in it would be very helpful Thank you John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Yeah Vivek I think in Q we had about of IP licensing revenue We expect a touch more than that in the fourth quarter this year and then wed expect kind of a modest level again next year similar to the amount of IP revenue that well have this year There are opportunities there and well kind of continue to pursue them as they come along So and then otherwise I think we talked already about our highspeed memory business growing sequentially in the quarter and that communications grew per se although not as not quite as strong in relative terms as the highspeed memory did So we did have a good quarter overall And when you look at the yearoveryear growth the core communications is still sustaining this yearoveryear growth capability Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Your line is now open Ross C Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Hi guys Thanks for letting me ask the question Congrats on solid execution in a difficult time I guess Ford youve gone through a ton of different design wins drivers new products et cetera If you were to put those all together and just think from a dollar perspective as opposed to a percent perspective how would you rankorder the biggest drivers of growth as we go into Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director So our the biggest driver of growth as opposed to biggest revenue period right I mean youre looking for growth Remember some of these are going from small base Obviously the new product as a percent growth would probably be the largest growing ones just because were starting from not much Ross So I could take you through if youd like the different businesses and we could talk about magnitude and percent Ross if that makes sense right Ross C Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Sure Yeah thatd be great Thank you Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director So if we start on the memory side as we said the DDR is going to be high growth It would double again from to so thatd be a nice growth factor for us But if you keep in mind that it would be offset by a declining DDR we then overall expect that to dampen that growth on the memory side right between the DDR growing in a very nice way and DDR declining On the long haul and metro markets thats the largest business we have today and its been growing at the corporate number for the overall communication business And the number of ports next year is expected to grow tremendously by yearonyear and we also have some new offerings taking us into metro with the surface mount driver Now there what happens is we are under pressure from a price decrease So the number of ports would be offset by the price decrease and would be helped by the continued transition to linear and the continued entrance into new markets such as Metro and CFP Digital and CFP analog So weve got in that market great expectation for the CFP digital as well as some new design we got on CFP analog And then coming to networking the core business which was the Gigabit networking as well as the Gigabit and Gigabit physical layer devices we acquired from Cortina are still expecting to get some nice growth driver as the Gigabit continues to ramp and we get some more designs with the and Cortina into servers The PAM and the new lowpower CDR are going from a very low base almost no revenue in to speak of so that growth should be very high just because youre starting from a very small number And finally transport is doing better than expected So transport is actually holding up better than expected and we do expect some incremental potential revenue So you put all this together and we are confident in getting to the consensus number that is currently out there But we are we want to be cautious on setting expectations ahead of ourselves and would like to keep executing and delivering a step at a time Ross C Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Thats great to hear There are so many different drivers I guess to summarize all of that from a revenue perspective if you put it together it sounds like the mix between towards your memory and your communications in general will probably skew a bit towards the comp side further in is that fair Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah I think fair Ross But both businesses are expected to grow And so you know I would expect to see something in the to range for the server side of the business over time and something in the to range for communications business That mix will generally continue Ross C Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities Inc And then I guess the followup to that John you guys have done a great job on the gross margin this year Given the new products some of the ASP transitions that Ford you talked about how should we conceptually think about the puts and takes to gross margin as we go into next year again with the IP revenues assumed to be relatively similar yearoveryear John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President In general I think we can maintain the gross margin levels I would always assume theyre going to go down basis points a quarter and hope that the reality proves us wrong and our job is to bring in new technology which were doing And I think thats going to allow us to maintain a fairly stable gross margin picture over the course of Ross C Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Great And then my last question will be on the OpEx side of things You talked about comfort with the consensus and wanting to keeping that under control for next year But just again conceptually when you look at the new product launches you have and the areas of investments that you look forward to for next year how should we think about the general OpEx trend that you guys are planning to run for John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Well I think again well see OpEx rise in and some of that will just be a function of not having quite as much customer cofunding as we had in here But in general were I think comfortable with Street estimates right now for OpEx which I think are trending around million or so and thats obviously up from this year but again its just a function of the customer cofunding per se Srini Sundararajan Summit Research Hi Thanks for taking the question Congrats on your good performance My question is have any of the mergers strengthened any of your competitors John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Srini Sundararajan Summit Research Right But with respect to your business what has been the effect of the mergers with respect to your business meaning even though it became pound but thats relative to size but John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President At this point the business continues to grow We remain very focused on growing the business achieving the best possible shareholder return and supporting our customer success We understand the benefits of scale In fact for us Cortina was a very successful acquisition for both Inphi and Cortina employees customers and shareholders So we remain open to possibility of scaling on our side Srini Sundararajan Summit Research Okay great One more question What is the reason for your high days of inventory and then what actions might you be taking to reduce it John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Srini this is John We disclosed a couple quarters ago that one of the things that came along with the Cortina acquisition was a supply of a Gigabit framer a very successful part that Cortinas shipped hundreds of millions of dollars over time but they had a last time buy notice from their foundry before the acquisition And we received the last time receipt of inventory in the March timeframe so we received a fairly solid chunk of inventory that were shipping overtime here We dont really have any concerns about being able to move that inventory or ship it but it is you know putting a chunk of inventory on the balance sheet Im not too worried of days Id rather have it come down to around days over time here but were making progress with it so Im not too uncomfortable at this stage All of my other questions have been asked and answered Thank you Brian Alger ROTH Capital Partners LLC Thank you Good afternoon guys and Ill echo the congratulations Wondering if we could look into the opportunity Obviously sounds like long haul and metro continued to be the right main drivers from a revenue standpoint But as we look at the Gig opportunity inside the data center can you maybe walk us through what changes are occurring with the largest data center providers in terms of moving towards Inphi and why we think whether its the second half of or what specifically is going on within those data centers that from an architecture standpoint is coming our way so to speak Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director The biggest change Brian is being driven by the introduction of Gigabit switchers and NIC cards So these new controllers and new switches are driving the uplink to Gigabit And because of these new switchers having the need for very dense interconnect the latest introduced switchers can support up to QSFP Gigabit module The need for powereffective and costeffective interconnect is skyrocketing And if you look at the different presentation by various data center participants everyone is pointing to the big bottleneck being the meter to kilometer Gigabit interconnect Inphi is supplying all the guts that go into a QSFP module and we do believe that weve got all the interns that would make those QSFP modules the most powereffective and the most costeffective modules in the industry for the kilometer applications So there are a bunch of players in the market today that are coming to market with PSM modules Those PSM modules are not capable of delivering kilometer distance So where we are focused and where both our CWDM four lambda solution as well as our two lambda PAM solution are focused are really these kilometer QSFP Gigabit module and thats going to be a major need for the data center of second half and And Inphi we do believe will be a strong player in that market Brian Alger ROTH Capital Partners LLC Okay great And just as a followup John you mentioned that the core communications was up about yearonyear splitting hairs between where were targeted How should we think about core communications in taking everything into account between the obvious large support growth in the metro and the emergence of Datacom and Gig How should we think about that core communications growth in the timeframe relative to John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President It should be a fairly similar growth pattern Brian I think weve talked and I think youll see it on our latest presentation charts on the website but youll see the growth in Gig ports expected for so I think around So but obviously just some ASP erosion but the growth rate is not unreasonable relative to the port count growth Brian Alger ROTH Capital Partners LLC Ruben Roy Piper Jaffray Co Broker Thank you Ford I just had a followup and clarification on some of the Gig commentary that youre making as it relates to PAM Is there still an opportunity that somewhat materially would you say around two lambda Gig or is this PAM opportunity really skewed towards Gig and something that we should expect starting second half of next year Last quarter you had talked about some initial shipments spring of Im just wondering if the changed or if its just the status of the way data centers are going to adopt PAM in general Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director So Ruben maybe the way to think about our PAM is first its going to be Gigabit okay So what the data centers are doing is adopting our solution first for Gigabit because right now there is a solution out there that is exclusive to one system OEM And so weve got many other OEMs adopting our PAM solution as its a costeffective and powereffective Gigabit solution and so that youd probably see that deployed first Second youll see the Gigabit so Gigabit would be on heels of that Gigabit We expect the Gigabit to probably ship in around mid then we expect the Gigabit PAM solution to ship in Q Prior to that though on Gigabit sort of when I talk about QSFP and the whole gut the CDR solution could ship slightly before the PAM solution or around the same time in Q as well So we start with Gig then we go to Gig with both CWDM and PAM and then we expect the Gig to be probably end of early And then we expect the Gigabit to be the first half of So thats sort of the succession of the different speeds Hopefully that clears it up Ruben Roy Piper Jaffray Co Broker Thats very helpful Thank you Ford I guess just a quick followup You mentioned showing a solution that works with the Silicon Photonics partner Silicon Photonics has come up a little more recently in some of the discussions around tradeshows and some of the companies that are participating Would you say that that thats a technology that is starting to look like its going to enter commercialization I dont know over the next months to months or is it still something thats kind of out there Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Actually it will enter commercialization in a big way next year So in two areas we you probably know theres a strong vendor in the long haul metro type of space who is coming to market with a digital CFP solution and thats a strong partner of ours Theres also in the data center space an LR type of solution There is a strong system OEM which has an internal silicon photonic solution and thats a strong partner of ours So we in both the long haul metro as well as data center markets we do expect Silicon Photonics to happen in a big way in And were at this point getting good visibility into improved ramp into for both segments Now there are other partners that would be coming to market later in the year that have not disclosed and were not ready to disclose But we do believe Silicon Photonics starts in and grows strongly from there on Gus Richard Northland Securities Inc Yes thanks for taking my question Based on the guidance you gave for your memory business is it reasonable to assume that the DDR revenue is going to be about million sort of implied am I getting that correct John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Gus Richard Northland Securities Inc Okay And then whats your expectation for that market for next year John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Well DDR will continue to decline and DDR will grow And right now wed expect that they at least offset each other We think DDR will grow a little bit more then DDR will decline So we should have a little bit of growth overall or we may have more growth than that We just want to wait and see how the design wins unfold and what volumes actually ship Gus Richard Northland Securities Inc Got it And then just to be explicit on the OTN business Was that down sequentially Can you talk a little bit about what youre seeing in that market John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Weve just seen some relative strength there Gus And what I would say is that there were design wins where people have equipment thats continuing to ship and there may be other newer solutions or platforms that just havent come out online as fast as people thought originally and so people continue to ship with the Cortina framing and mapping solutions and were happy to oblige as long as theyre continuing to ship in volume Gus Richard Northland Securities Inc Okay So that business is effectively running flat with last year or is there just a slight decline Any color again would be helpful John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Gus Richard Northland Securities Inc Okay All right Thank you very much Appreciate you taking the questions Thank you And our last question comes from the line of Richard Shannon with CraigHallum Your line is now open Please go ahead Richard Cutts Shannon CraigHallum Capital Group LLC Hi guys Thank you for taking my questions I guess just a couple from me I was reading through my notes from earlier in the call about a question about share in DDR John I think it was you who was responding to the question I think you mentioned kind of number for next year and then maybe number in I wrote in my notes that youve mentioned just registers Did you mean to be that both for registers and buffers or is it specific to one or the other Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah I meant for both In reality were shipping registers today and through this year and then well begin we think this would buffer sometime next year so that will enter into the mix and will contribute toward that share build Richard Cutts Shannon CraigHallum Capital Group LLC Okay perfect Thats what I thought Second question regarding the new drivers Ford youd mentioned some pricing pressure in the driver space and ASP ratchet down I guess just a couple things When and how is that happening Is that based on competitive pressures and are you also seeing the amplifier side or is that kind of resisting the pricing pressures Ford G Tamer President Chief Executive Officer Director Richard this is a regular ASP decline that weve been experiencing for the past few years So its not anything unusual Its just a regular course of running that business Richard Cutts Shannon CraigHallum Capital Group LLC Okay Fair enough I guess just last question for me Regarding the customer cofunding it sounds like youre expecting some funding to go through at least part of next year When do you expect to see the product result of this work Is this something that will happen before the end of next year is it further out than that John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President No we expected to see the fruits of the latest customer cofunding shipping in the back half of next year Richard So the projects tend to run months to months depending on what were doing or what were trying to put together for somebody and then sometimes theres a followon project But were already shipping product today and starting to ship in volume for things where weve got cofunding a year and a half to two years ago So its kind of an ongoing Richard Cutts Shannon CraigHallum Capital Group LLC Okay Can you say whether the programs are ongoing whether in the communications or memory space or both John S Edmunds Chief Financial Officer and Vice President They generally have been in the communication space but theyll be in both Richard Cutts Shannon CraigHallum Capital Group LLC Okay Great Thats all the
