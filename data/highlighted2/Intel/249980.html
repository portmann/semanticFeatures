Intels Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management acknowledged its mobile business losses under questioning by analysts Despite this an SA contributor has taken issue with my contention that Intels mobile business continues to lose money Under questioning by analysts at its recent Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC CEO Brian Krzanich frankly acknowledged Intels mobile business losses not once but twice Despite that SA contributor Alex Cho appears to deny the losses in a recent article and asserts that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is wellpositioned in mobile Given that the most important mobile device continues to be the smartphone and given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has negligible presence in smartphones I would have to disagree The specific analyst questions about mobile losses occurred during the first QA session The first question was from Mike McConnell of Pacific Crest and occurs at the minute mark in the video Just a quick question on the mobile outlook for next year You have a full year of SoFIA next year which gives you a lower cost structure and the contra revenue going away for a full year Why wont the losses go down by even more than the million Theres a couple things One theres still a fairly large investment in our modem and were trying to get up onto our yearly cadence as were ramping the volume Youre right were eliminating the contra weve got that Were continuing to improve our product mix but were still ramping our volume Were going into phones with our APUs and modems but at a fairly cautious rate So its about volume It is indeed about volume The second analyst whos name I couldnt quite make out but he was from Barclays asks at the minute mark On mobile with the guidance youre essentially halving the losses that you started off with The next part probably would require revenue to make that a profitable business Is that a possible target to actually make that a profitable business We see many companies pursue modems and most have bowed out because its a two prong problem You need to get carrier approvals but the small OEMs just dont add up to a lot of revenue Where are you in terms of carrier approvals and proof of concepts so that you can elephant hunt the big SKUs And could you actually make this business profitable Absolutely we can make this business profitable The modem is currently shipping around the world including the US Its in the Asus Zen Phone and you can walk into an ATT store today and buy that The which is our next generation cat modem is shipping to customers and carriers and validations are ongoing today So people are out testing the today for shipment in products next year Weve got both Spreadtrum and Rockchip working on products Spreadtrum is starting to get into the design mode Rockchip building on different levels of iteration of their product And we showed you with the Internet of Things that all of those things have to be connected I dont know what else is required to realize that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still losing money on their mobile business other than to listen to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management have to say on the subject Theres hardly a financial analyst interchange of some form be it quarterly earnings calls or Investor Meeting where the subject doesnt come up Furthermore no one can offer enough compelling evidence to support the notion that theyre actually losing money on a consolidated operating basis from mobile But no one has argued that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has lost money on a consolidated basis due to its mobile business All during when the Mobile and Communications Group MCG racked up billion in operating losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still had net income every quarter No one disputes that Its been argued and Cho seems to repeat these arguments that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was merely making investments that it needed to make anyway and that it was just by some unfortunate quirk of accounting that those losses got booked under the Mobile and Communications Group This really defies common sense No one would fault <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for wanting to make investments in its future But the losses in MCG were a function of the almost complete absence of revenue for the year For the entire year of MCG only had million in revenue and for Q actually managed to achieve negative revenue of million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also bragged that it sold if it can be called that million tablet processors These were Atom class processors that were accounted as part of the sales of MCG not the PC Client Group This comes to per tablet processor Even less if you assume that MCG had some other sales as well This was contrarevenue in action The difficulty for analysts has been that since the beginning of MCG and the PC Client Group have been combined into the Client Computing Group CCG which had operating profit large enough to cover the losses of the MCG Does anyone believe that when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>slammed the two groups together the losses just suddenly went away Regardless of the rationale that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management offered for the reorganization it did serve to obfuscate the mobile losses and make their determination more difficult for outsiders The billion MCG loss for was a fairly big chunk taken out of Intels billion operating profit for that year and so could be assumed to be unpopular with investors Difficult to determine but not impossible to infer at least approximately MCG had been losing about billion per quarter and this was almost all operating cost since there was virtually no revenue coming in As soon as the groups were combined the combined groups operating cost went up by you guessed it about billion as the chart below shows This was despite the fact that revenue for the combined group was lower yy than for the PC Client group alone as I show in the chart below Ive focused on the mobile losses not because of the dollar amounts per se although they are not insignificant but because the losses point to the breakage in Intels mobile device strategy up to now As I pointed out in Part of my series on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Investor Meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>appears to be pivoting away from the strategy The most tangible signs of the change in strategy are that operating costs are coming down for CCG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management have given assurance that contra revenue really is going away and the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>projects sales of only million tablet processors in Q a drop yy Intels mobile device strategy was a failure because it was an attempt to impose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture processors on the mobile device industry that was and is doing quite well without <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside Now that contrarevenue is going away the sales of the tablet Atom series processors are evaporating And what of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in phones As much as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management were fond of bragging about how many tablet processors have been sold theres never been any mention of how many phone processors were sold Because the number is miniscule and not likely to increase SoFIA now dubbed Atom X series was to have been Intels great hope for its future in smartphones Next years X will be moved to nm and feature Intels LTE modem However the Airmont cores it will use are already used in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom X In performance benchmarks the X is already inferior to the best ARM architecture smartphone processors from Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Samsung OTCSSNLF At best next years X will find a place in rd tier smartphones for developing markets where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been a niche player for some time The lack of a true mobile device business probably dooms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>unless it can somehow find a way to adapt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is on the wrong side of the paradigm shift that has seen Apple Samsung Huawei and now LG embrace the custom system on chip SOC rather than buy commodity processors Commodity processor makers such as Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM are adapting by moving down market where the profits are more difficult to come by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Qualcomm appear to be on a collision course to try to invest the low cost end of the mobile device market But Qualcomm has the benefit of superior ARM architecture processors as well as vastly more experience in communications technology Frankly I give the edge to Qualcomm I consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel
