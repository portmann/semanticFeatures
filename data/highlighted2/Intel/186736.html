smartphones from Google have to settle for processors that are a year behind Apple Watching Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Nexus phone event today brought home to me how noncompetitive the commodity smartphone market has become compared to Apples NASDAQ AAPL iPhones Google unveils a supposedly flagship phone the Nexus p but its saddled with a Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon which isnt even competitive with last years iPhone system on chip the A In effect the entire commodity smartphone market has fallen a year behind Apple Weve been hearing a lot about the Qualcomm Snapdragon since its going into so many supposedly premium smartphones such as the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro and now the Google Nexus p made by Huawei This is the version which apparently has fixed the overheating problems that are thought by some to have caused Samsung to reject it for the Galaxy S The Snap is the bit SOC Qualcomm should have had a year ago when they needed an answer to the iPhone s second generation bit SOC the A The fact that its now going into so many phones just shows how disadvantaged the commodity smartphone makers are becoming by being dependent on commodity processors Samsung has the most competitive with Apple SOC around the Exynos that goes into the Galaxy S but theyre not sharing The fact that the Snap is the next best available option just shows how broken the commodity model has become The performance difference between Apples current generation A SOC and the Snap has become so profound that I dont think anyone can reasonably argue that Apple will not have a significant market advantage as a result Anandtech has recently been benchmarking the iPhone s and heres just one of the benchmarks using a Google supplied browser benchmark Notice that Anandtech threw in the Microsoft Surface Pro with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core i processor even though it wasnt really appropriate for a smartphone comparison I can only assume that they did it just to have some device that was faster than the iPhone s Also note that the A in the iPhone is more than twice as fast as the in the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro The is the poster child for everything thats wrong with the commodity processor model It was late to market to begin with being introduced about a year after Apple shattered the industry with the worlds first bit ARM processor in a smartphone the A that was introduced with the iPhone s in September Then it failed to win acceptance by Samsung for the S supposedly due to overheating problems Actually to some degree Samsung rigged the competition with its own processor by virtue of being able to use its own nm process The had to settle for TSMCs nm process the same that was used by Apple for the contemporaneous A in the iP But while Apple was able to engineer a highly competitive with Samsung processor in the A despite the process disadvantage Qualcomm was not This underscores the central advantage that Apple and Samsung have gained over the commodity processor makers such as Qualcomm Apple has been able to leverage its huge profitability into a world class processor design capability This design capability is on display in the benchmarks the A is racking up Apples processors are pulling away from the rest of the commodity pack Only Samsung is keeping up barely Apples profit advantage also was put to good competitive use in the funding of dual sources for the A As I pointed out recently the A is being produced by both Samsung and TSMC This has been noticed by Anandtech and confirmed by Chipworks who noted that the processors are of slightly different size The dual sourcing is another master stroke by Apple that is only made possible by the huge profits that Apple achieves Anandtechs observations about this bear repeating With dual sourcing essentially requiring the chip to be taped out twice once for each fab it requires significant financial and engineering resources a cost that not very many companies besides Apple can take on without significant risk In my discussion of the TSMC fabrication I pointed to the fact that Apple is highly motivated to sever its dependence on Samsung and I believe that this is why Apple went dual source But dual sourcing also meant that Apple could be sure to meet the huge initial demand for the phones on opening weekend million in sales according to Apple Dual sourcing underscores the competitive advantages that Apple has achieved in mobile processor design and fabrication Only Samsung can and probably is matching Apples investment As such the two companies are pulling away from the rest of the ARM commodity pack Apples iPhone sales are now so large that Apple has wiped out what has always been assumed to be the ultimate advantage of commodity processors economies of scale As a consequence Apples SOCs are no more expensive to develop and produce than any commodity SOC such as the The fundamental lesson that the commodity semiconductor industry is still learning to its grief is that the custom SOC paradigm has no cost disadvantages at Apple scale while retaining numerous performance advantages Those who point to the for signs of hope for the commodity ARM processor business are missing the big picture tectonic shift that is underway in the consumer electronics industry After seeing just how good the A is Ive become even more bullish on iPhone sales for the December quarter and continue to regard Apple as a strong buy Apples position at the premium end of the smartphone market is unassailable for the
