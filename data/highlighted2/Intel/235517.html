than ARMbased chips like the AX With all due respect I strongly disagree with the claim of Timothy Arcuri analyst from Cowen and Company that the AX processor Apple NASDAQ AAPL uses on the iPad Pro is a threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Arcuris argument that the AX has better benchmark scores than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core M used in the MacBook is not evidence that Intels Mac business is threatened Arcuris speculation is important because the Mac division now generates more revenue for Apple than the iPad division Any suggestion of Apple abandoning Intelmade processors for its Mac computers deserves to be quashed immediately Investors and analysts should understand that the impressive CPUGPU benchmark scores of the AX are useless for businessprofessional users who rely on xonly Mac software Arcuri conveniently forgot that even the Office for the iOS platform is a greatly watereddown version It doesnt even offer of the features found inside Office for Mac My point is that ARMbased processors are at a great disadvantage because they cannot offer the same desktop PClevel productivity This is because the codes used in CISC Complex Instruction Set of Computers xbased productivity software like Office for Mac and Photoshop are difficult to recompile or translate to run on the limited Reduced Instruction Set of Computers RISC instruction set of ARMbased chips like the threecore AX Tim Cooks claim that an iPad Pro could replace business computers was just a sales pitch to pump up public interest Multiple handson reviews are saying the iPad Pro is not an existentialist threat to laptops or desktop Macs This is something I always argued for the iPad Pro is just a companion not replacement device for Macusing people Intels lucrative business of supplying highmargin Core i and Core i chips to Mac computers faces little risk from the release of the iPad Pro Unless Apple can find a way to create a copy of Photoshop CC to work on the Reduced Instruction Set of Computers RISC limitation of the AX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will continue to receive x processor purchase orders for MacBooks Let us not forget that the growth of Mac sales was largely due to Apple shifting from RISC PowerPC chips to Intels x processors Arcuris theory that AX could replace Intelmade processors on Applebranded computers is a big step backward Apple dumped RISC PowerPC processors precisely because it wanted its Macs to be compatible with more xonly software The highend MacBook Pro and Mac Pro computers which uses Core i and Core i <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors will always be more powerful and useful than any ARMbased iPad Pro Another reason to dismiss the thought that Apple will abandon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors for Mac computers is Apple itself Apple continues to stick to its product differentiation policy that Mac OS and iOS devices will always be built as standalone products The ARMbased AX chip cannot obviously run Mac OS and the software related to it Apple will therefore continue to rely on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to keeps it highmargin Mac business competitive The iPad Pro only allows for Apple to sell it to Macusing customers that want a touchscreenfriendly gadget for their Mac OS Xonly software like Photoshop or Final Cut Pro Market appeal of the pricey Intelless iPad Pro is likely going to be weak It has limited total addressable market because the AX will never be able to run important industrystandard or custom enterprise x software Tim Cooks touting of the alleged PCkiller potential of the iPad Pro did not exactly generate much interest from socialweb communities Online interest over the iPad Pro has significantly dropped from September to the November official commercial launch If we look at the chart from TickerTags the iPad Pro buzz wordterm is no longer a hot topic like it was last September The weak social interest in the ARMbased iPad Pro during its commercial launch week favors my assertion that it is unlikely to cannibalize sales of Intelpowered MacBooks It makes sense as the pricey iPad Pro has inferior businesscentric usability when compared to the similarlypriced Surface Pro or other Windows tabletnotebook products Even my Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph in Windows notebook which only has an old dualcore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Atom ZD SOC is more useful than the AXpowered iPad Pro INTC is a Buy Investors should not worry too much about Arcuris exaggerated perception of the RISC AX chip It is not and will never be a serious threat to the Maccentric processor sales of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Tim Cook is also wrong to say that iPad Pro could seriously replace PCs On the contrary my prediction is that if the experimental iPad Pro fails to achieve enough commercial success Tim Cook might just release a touchscreenfriendly MacBook This is the only way that Apple can properly neutralize the growing popularity of the Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT
