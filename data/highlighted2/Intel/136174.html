class='textDiv'>Micron Not Selling Hot Dogs Anymore Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha Very few understand the implications of D XPoint storage class memory SCM At least percent of the DRAM market will be obsolesced by SCM like D XPoint Prior to publication I revised my last article thousands of times Over the course of this lengthy process I changed the analogy that I was drawing but neglected to update the title to reflect this The article was supposed to have been entitled Micron Not Selling Hot Dogs Anymore In hindsight the subsequently confusingly unrelated Purple Swan title was fortuitous in that it was symbolic of what happened extremely few people understood the Earthshaking F tornado curefordigitalcancer implications of the Micron NASDAQ MU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC technology that I had highlighted Now that Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have formally announced the technology with the awful name of D XPoint it is clear that the vast majority still cannot fathom its implications To this end I feel like I have another chance to explain how Micron will transition from selling commodity hot dogs into fivestar highend cuisine Because I didnt do a proper job the first time around let me try to boil down Purple Swan into its essence Probably on the order of percent of todays DRAM consumption will dissolve over the next few years perhaps sooner depending on how aggressive they are with the rollout in addition to the speed at which other players react To emphasize this point lets revisit an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>patent Dynamic partial power down of memoryside cache in a level memory hierarchy The focus of this approach is on providing performance with a relatively small amount of a relatively higherspeed memory such as DRAM while implementing the bulk of the system memory using significantly cheaper and denser nonvolatile random access memory NVRAM Hundreds of billions of dollars annually are about to change direction as a direct result of XPoint but yet one can still buy Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>at phenomenal discounts This is painfully unbelievable to me Speculation is cheap so lets go back to the horses mouth Heres a new one from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Method and system for providing instant responses to sleep state transitions with nonvolatile random access memory With the use of the NVRAM the platform can enter a poweredoff sleep state in response to a request for entry into a powered sleep state The difference in power consumption between the powered sleep state and the poweredoff sleep state can be one or two orders of magnitude On a mobile platform this power saving can translate into a battery life in standby mode from a few days to a few hundreds of days When you turn off the screen on your current cell phone the CPU and memory are both instructed to enter into a powered sleep state but they still draw nontrivial power in order to keep the volatile memory DRAM and SRAM alive With XPoint they just call the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>instruction WBINVD and then remove power to both CPU and memory The system will resume instantly upon request from the baseband or the user Mind you the power efficiency aspect is just one of the many benefits of this new technology Cost efficiencies from dramatically simplified packaging will be another benefit With bits in a byte the announced Gbit chip works out to Gbytes If you were to stack four of those chips on top of the eDRAM cache that is already present on some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors you wind up with a complete GB systemonpackage Just add some accessories pop this into your favorite platform phone tablet laptop PC server gaming console etc and youre ready to go And remember theres no need for RAM or storage in this configuration as the cached XPoint can be partitioned to fulfill both functions Allow me to revisit that first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>patent as I think that everyone will better understand it at this point In one embodiment a notebook computer is configured with a near memory and a PCMS device which performs the role of both a far memory and a mass storage device ie which is logically partitioned to perform these roles as shown in FIG When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>released the Iris Pro they disclosed the following regarding the cache Theres only a single size of eDRAM offered this generation MB Since its a cache and not a buffer and a giant one at that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>found that hit rate rarely dropped below It turns out that for current workloads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>didnt see much benefit beyond a MB eDRAM however it wanted the design to be future proof <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doubled the size to deal with any increases in game complexity and doubled it again just to be sure I believe the exact wording Intels Tom Piazza used during his explanation of why MB was go big or go home Its very rare that we see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>be so liberal with die area which makes me think this MB design is going to stick around for a while This wasnt go big or go home This was calculated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>designed this eDRAM cache for XPoint not conventional DRAM From Intels documentation we know that the read speeds on XPoint are actually better than DRAM side note the variable numbers are required to accommodate the slower performance with MLC and TLC With all writes going directly to the highbandwidth eDRAM cache a hybrid cached XPoint system is going to have better performance and lower cost than a conventional DRAMonly system Since I am one of them I know that the pedants are about to point out that XPoint isnt as durable as DRAM and therefore isnt a suitable replacement Thusly I will point out that it doesnt need to be Only the most highperformance applications will require DRAMonly main memory Even the average server will use SCM for main memory I dont believe that Micron has conventional nanometer DRAM forthcoming if theyre smart theyre building widebus highbandwidth eDRAM cache memory or this stuff which is as fast as SRAM but as dense as DRAM If theyre real smart theyll bundle this cache memory with XPoint and create a powerefficient highperformance hybrid memory product Perhaps this accounts for the bump in inventory Regardless the MicronIntel rollout webcast proved to me that something is going on things seem very harried and they produced more questions than answers I can only think of a handful of reasons As someone who lost a lot of money as an ECD shareholder I am definitely biased And I certainly have to respect defamation laws if theres a good reason for all of the delays and secrecy then MicronIntel should simply tell us or at least publicly recognize that they cant tell us what is going on Otherwise speculation is appropriate in order to cover the bases from a risk perspective In my previous article I speculated that there may have been some nefarious activity in Microns million acquisition of ECDs percent interest in Ovonyx In I knew that ECDs phase change memory technology was very likely to displace DRAM and NAND as did most of academia Everyone was very excited But the story unfolded like this November ECD appoints new CEO February MicronIntel add emerging memory to their JV August Court grants Ovonyx sale to Micron August Testimony provided that ECD shopped Ovonyx to potential strategic purchasers which include Samsung Rambus and Hynix Marketing was done by Bridge Associates who have not been in business for years Investment banker was not put under oath lawyer speaks on his behalf January Micron discusses memory combinations in the hybrid memory cube Plans full production for late or early August ECD bankruptcy closing adjourned from to September Micron schedules HMC volume production for later in December ECD bankruptcy adjourned to Then again to Then again to Then again to Then again to Then again to Then again to Then again to During the proposed sale of ECDs Ovonyx share I lawyeredup because I felt that the purchase price was an insult My attorney explained to me that cherry picking is simply an ingrained part of bankruptcy culture and the judge wouldnt care about my concerns that the marketing was conducted by a defunct firm that never had experience specializing in the computer memory market This attorney also explained to me that a bankruptcy is like an unreviewable calls in baseball once the bankruptcy is closed everything that transpired is not subject to review because this is how weve always done it But to reiterate this is all speculation based on the delays of nm DRAM D NAND and New Memory A Gen and the depressed share prices of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron subsequent to announcing the Holy Grail of computing The hybrid memory cube has still not reached volume production The Automata processor has seen similar delays Are the feds boiling the frog or is Micron just really bad at scheduling things For reference Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection about a month prior to ECD and emerged two years ago I have no idea if any of the events on that timeline are related but if they are they should make a movie about it The day after my last article was published ECDs bankruptcy closing was again adjourned until August th Nearly immediately the Yahoo Message board for ECD was shut down This is where shareholders were still actively discussing matters sometimes dozens of posts per day Was this all a coincidence Perhaps MicronIntel are being boiled by the feds and management have finally realized it With no plans for conventional nm DRAM and perhaps even D NAND waning share prices and angry investors it would be appropriate to expunge all things PCM replace it with something else and move forward This might explain why there were no specifics disclosed on XPoint theyre using some lesser memory element to satisfy the impending fed investigation raid that will likely happen if any of this conjecture happens to be true IBM recently contacted me in order to brief me on the big news we will present later this year theyve got PCM in the wings and have already discussed it as if a foregone conclusion Disk retirements may actually be quicker than people expect with the invent of new technologies like Phase Change Memory which holds special potential here the D stacked cells PCM will increase capacity significantly More recently I discovered from Samsungs patents that theyre likely ready to go with PCM as well What is going on here If it is a foregone conclusion and everyone has the stuff then why is it so quiet out here There may be more importance in the transistorless disclosure than anything else As I have previously discussed the implications of a nanoscale Ovonic Threshold Switch which is used to replace the transistor as discussed in Purple Swan are astronomical Heres an Ovonyx patent application from Dont let the title fool you it is an attempt to conceal the importance Method and apparatus for thin film memory In an illustrative embodiment a layer of complementary thin film logic is formed on a substrate which may be nonsinglecrystalline material such as glass ceramic or fiberglass for example The layer of complementary thin film logic may include asymmetric three terminal ovonic threshold switches which after forming are interconnected to produce a desired combination of devices that form complementary logic gates combinatorial logic sequential logic latches or address decoders for example In this illustrative embodiment one or more layers of thin film memory such as phase change memory are formed on top of the layer of complementary thin film logic Essentially this invention enables the semiconductor industry to replace silicon with glass ceramic or fiberglass oodles cheaper This technology is priceless and will quickly displace conventional fabrication methods if it can be scaled to nanoscale levels It is possible that the big players got together and decided that it wasnt worth bidding this technology to its true value tens of billions or more But thats just the only reason I can think of as to why Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>arent trading
