</span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha SoFIA SoCs are very competitive from a performance and integration point of view Contra revenue could be an additional compelling point in SoFIA offer Cherry Trail is only a mid offer among the entire Atom SoCs The highend offer will come with Broxton and Goldmont nm switch will come for SoFIA in a lowend offer and midend offer providing a great technology advantage vs competitors SoCs at nm Producers started to release G SoFIA SoCs powered devices in summer and they will release further devices with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC LTE SoCs in H These processors do not provide massive performances On the other hand they are projected to penetrate the lowend and cheap tabletsmartphone market Intels target is to acquire some market share from the lowerend segment of the emerging markets The company wants also to provide a more complete offer during The peculiar aspect is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is closing the gap with competitors and when you better analyze Intels roadmap you can find out that it is building up a good offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has released Atom xC and Atom xCRK the only one made by Rockchip on the market These SoCs are built with a nm node they use a Mali TMPMP and they finally integrate a long series of welcomed features GHSPA CNV PMU Audio GPS Bluetooth WiFi This kind of integration is what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has always lacked in the lowend and midend segment of smartphone market Obviously the used technology node is quite old but the target that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is aiming for is not different from competitors Qualcomm Incs NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon and Mediatek MTM use a nm node and even if Snapdragons have an LTE modem inside these SoCs are quite slower than the Atom xCRK The Atom scores around points in Antutu while the Mediatek and Snapdragon score around points For that kind of offer I think that SoFIA is quite compelling from the integration and speed point of view Atom xC and Atom xC are the next SoCs that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to release They use the same nm node but they are powered by Airmont CPU cores with higher frequencies they integrate a Mali TMP and an LTE modem Such an SoC would likely target products like Mediatek MT MT and Snapdragon that will have similar features LTE modem included These SoCs generally score between points in Antutu given that C and C have better graphics CPU architecture and clock compared to the previous x SoCs we can expect performances between points a result that would make these SoFIAs quite compelling moreover when these solutions are targeting sub devices We all know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has used contra revenue to push tablet SoCs sales There is some discussion about the contra revenue cut related to the plunge in tablet SoC sales We must recall that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and producers are pushing Core M and xx in allinone laptops which are greatly eroding pure tablet revenues Therefore the tablet sales plunge is not worrying in my opinion and it does not mean that the Atom SoCs are not competitive at all In any case I do not want to focus on that aspect but I want to recall a recent news which talks about possible and likely contra revenue for x SoFIA SoCs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is believed to bestow contra revenue of about per x SoC to quicken the new SoC adoption Such behavior would be suitable to heavily enter the smartphone and tablet market from the lowend entry point It would be compatible with contra revenue lowering target also Given that SoFIA is targeting a market where it is possible to obtain an ARM va SoC not fully integrated at nearly such a strategy could be aggressive compelling and effective for producers The biggest doubt about Intels strategy is if it will be able to enter the smartphone market since its actual presence is nearly around aside from Asus ZenFone offer It looks like Intels contra revenue and fullSoC integration are sufficient to attract various producers from the emerging markets Chinese market aside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is attracting producersretailers even from other countries such as Philippines Cherry Mobile Ekotek Indonesia ADVAN and India In addition further products will be released with the G and LTE x which are the most alluring SoCs of the first SoFIA generation The SoFIA offer will switch directly to the nm node in mid providing a very consistent performance and efficiency boost compared to the actual nm offer The jump from nm to nm would roughly reduce power consumption by or boost performance by without touching at all the architecture In addition Mediatek and Qualcomm solutions for the lowend market even the midend are still projected with a nm node in leaving a good entry point for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Intels roadmap showed that the SoFIA offer would have split into two nm routes in the SoFIA LTE for the low endmarket which would substitute the first generation and the SoFIA MID for the midend market Such a move will likely attract more customers even from the midend market since actual x and x do not provide the full integration that SoFIA MID would do This will be interesting really The Goldmont architecture will be the Airmont successor which actually powers Atom xC Atom xC x and x while Silvermont will be relegated to the ultra lowend offer The Goldmont architecture is a new one and it will provide a consistently better performance than the Airmont core which was only a tick switch If you take a look at the previous two slidesimages you can see that the actual Cherry Trail offer x and x is stated as a tablet midend platform compared to BroxtonMorganfield Goldmont architecture which is stated as a performance platform for both tablets and smartphones points in DMark Unlimited overall fps in GFXBench TRex p offscreen fps in GFXBench Manhattan p offscreen These results are very good for a W midend SoC and they make a good base for an interesting BroxtonMorganfield solution If you take a look at the following table you will see that the actual <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>midoffer is competitive against the upcoming competitors Take the Snapdragon as an example It is a dual quadcore with an A big cluster and an A little cluster Based on preview infos this SoC scores points at Geekbench faster than Z by but it is slower in GFXBench scoring fps in TRex offscreen slower by and fps in Manhattan offscreen slower by I have some doubts about these performances since the SD is still a nm SoC it is very likely that the development board of SD had no kind of power constrain making this performance too optimistic In any case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>x which uses an old architecture has comparable scores to the upcoming SoCs that will be released next year it is quite remarkable It must be recalled that the Helio P and SD have additional features LTE modem for Helio P and WiFi BT GPS and LTE modules for the SD The lack of this is an obvious drawback for the Atom solution but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to release the SoFIA MID offer next year while x and x are solutions and they have a very low SDPTDP SD and P TDPs are unknown but they are probably set around W given the SDxx specifications You all know what DXP is and how it will be a disruptive technology in the following years But what does it do with SoFIA and Atom SoCs Well DXP memory is a very fast one that could be used in fully integrated SoCs to obtain massive performances and maximum miniaturization probably an unattainable product for competitors for some years At the moment DXP is centered on cost effectiveness for SSDs and large memory configurations but in it will arrive an EM Generation technology that will be performancefocused That kind of product could be suitable for a full SoC integration and it would open the door to something very interesting in DXP would be a real trump card for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>given that it is not willing to concede licenses about it In any case we will have to wait two years at least to see what will happen in the mobile field with these memories With a better view of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing I think it is possible to understand that the Atom series is more promising than what it was in the past SoFIA offer looks to be very competitive and the contra revenue will be a very big help without being too much of a cash burden to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In addition SoFIA offer will get bigger in with the lowend second generation at nm and a new midend offer always at nm Broxton will come in mid providing a real performance solution which is still missing remember that x and x are stated to be mid class compared to Broxton Given the early adoption of SoFIA SoCs and the upcoming products within mid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is set to aggressively enter the tablet and smartphone market from the bottom moreover in the emerging markets The introduction of a mid SoFIA offer would likely erode some market share from the midend market providing good chances of success As for the midhighend and highend market there is no necessity for full SoC integration as shown by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd OTC SSNLF and Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL with their personal SoCs having separated WiFi BT RF and audio modules it softens heat generation and it provides better cooling and power efficiency for the central SoC This arrangement gives very good results with high power SoCs even with the trade off of higher costs and lower motherboard efficiency and space In this scenario I expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will obtain good results with the SoFIA platform while Broxton may be the first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>SoC able to get attention in the high performance field If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be able to penetrate the mobile market even starting from the lowmidend devices the mobile scenario could radically change and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would become quite problematic for competitors If you also consider its potential with technologies like D Xpoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is quite dangerous for Qualcomm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is probably a very good bet on the long run even without a rosy future in smartphone market But things may be already changing for better in that field Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a
