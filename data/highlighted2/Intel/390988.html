The Good News Continues Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD guides for strong Q with QoQ revenue increase The company signs a JV agreement with China firm THATIC for custom server chips It receives million Q from JV agreement Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD reported firstquarter results on Thursday April st and there were plenty of pleasant surprises in CEO Lisa Sus presentation First of all AMD announced a million JV licensing agreement with Chinese firm THATIC Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co Ltd The agreement includes an upfront payment of million CEO Su also confirmed semicustom SoC System on a Chip deals totaling at least billion over the next years On the financial side the company projected a sales increase for the nd quarter to be nonGAAP profitable in the nd half and to be cash flowpositive for All the good news supports my argument that AMD is on the cusp of big share price gains by the end of as I wrote in the following articles More Reasons Why AMD Will Be In AMD This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AnkleBiter Is On Its Way To Substantial Profits In this article I will continue my argument that AMD is one of the best investments available in the tech market over the next years THATIC agreement opens huge opportunities in China The joint venture agreement is worth at least million and probably much more long term And a licensing agreement with one Chinese company opens the doors for similar agreements with other Chinese organizations Not only is the Chinese server market potentially much larger the countrys billion population is more than that of US and Europe combined it could move forward at a much faster rate than other markets That is because the Chinese do not have the desktop presence that the US does Therefore prying fullsize keyboards and monitors from the cold dead hands of desktop users will not be the problem it is in the US Chinese users are by and large mobile users with cell phones andor tablets both of which lend themselves to cloudbased services more than desktops do More users and fewer desktops mean much larger and faster adoption Note also this agreement is for both ARM and x chips thus belying some peoples belief that AMD cannot license x without Intels NASDAQ INTC approval Sometimes investors forget that AMD is a relatively small company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>sells more in a month than AMD does in a year And Intels recent employee layoff was rd more than AMDs entire workforce of This means incremental sales improvements and new products such as Polaris and Zen can have outsize influence on the companys sales and profits A small market share improvement by AMD can also have outsize effects on its bottom line And when it comes to servers its market share is effectively zero which is why Zen and China are so important to AMDs future In its data center division contributed billion in revenue with billion in profit Its processing chips for the data center has a market share and for that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can charge huge price tags for companies to get hold of that silicon If there is a market that fits AMDs core capabilities it is VR Projected to grow at a CAGR of by VR needs lowpower highcapability GPUs and CPUs such as Polaris and Zen Even without these two advanced products AMD is making inroads to the VR market We believe VR will be a key longterm demand driver for AMD across both our consumer and Professional Graphics offerings especially as content creators require more powerful GPUs to create fully immersive VR experiences To capitalize on this trend Im proud to share that we plan to launch the industrys most powerful platform for VR creation and consumption at the end of this month when we introduce the Radeon Pro Duo Speculation around a PlayStation NYSE SNE upgrade continues Does AMDs announced billion in SoC contracts include game consoles or other products Lisa Su was particularly evasive when it came to a question about the semicustom SoC wins I dont believe that weve gone through any detail about what those wins are So I would prefer to let that come out as our customers are ready to launch If the three announced billion worth of SoC contracts are not all game consoles then that means two things Other large markets for semicustom chips are opening up There may still be another console contract or two out there to be had as everyone upgrades to VR for competitive reasons Announcing the company will be nonGAAP profitable in the second half is a very big deal Lisa Su a usually cautious and circumspect CEO did not hesitate to announce profits are coming much sooner than expected For the full year we are confident that our product portfolio and business execution can further strengthen our financial results and enable us to grow annual revenue and return to nonGAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year That is an amazing statement because by the second half of this year neither Polaris nor Zen will have made any meaningful contribution to profits In fact they will be generating costs without sales for most of that period That can only bode well for results Increasing sales and margins will generate at least in Here is how I get to share earnings in Revenue In AMD did billion down from billion in But management has already projected a increase for the second quarter Plus we have the THATIC deal recognizing some revenue the new semicustoms kicking in at about million and some added VR sales Polaris uptick So lets say billion for I project at billion sales billion with Zen picking up an million share from Intels x server market and billion market share increase in x desktoplaptops by Zen Add in increased sales from Polaris and other VR sources at million and another million from licensingsemicustom sales and you get billion Compared to Intels sales of billion those seem like modest increases Margin Assuming margin will expand as a bigger percentage of sales comes from Zen and Polaris products The spreadsheet uses and versus the current SGA expense Rises slightly from billion to billion Su has kept a tight rein on SGA and I do not expect it to run away like it did under Rory Read Unexpected expense This is actually falling and was only million in the last quarter but I kept it level at million to be conservative AMD is not a company without problems Cash has been a constant concern and this past quarter was no different According to my backoftheenvelope calculations it burned through million in the first quarter From CFO Kumar Turning to the balance sheet our cash and cash equivalents total million at the end of the quarter down million from the end of the prior quarter So the company was down million but that was after banking million from the THATIC deal so the total used was million This emphasizes the importance of closing the NantongFujitsu deal this quarter With sales and new contracts ramping up inventory requirements will be going up too as would working capital requirements Plus neither Polaris nor Zen will be generating any positive cash flow this year so cash is king as I discussed previously here and here Another concern is that Zen andor Polaris do not hit their target ship dates According to Su Zen is sampling this quarter which is good news but if cash does not show up on time delays could be imminent AMDs latest earnings release was the most positive I have seen from the company in years New semicustom contracts are being readied for production IP and licensing is generating revenue Zen is sampling will be cash flowpositive and earnings will be positive in the second half The company is not completely out of the woods yet but if the Nantong deal does close this quarter then I would be very confident will be a very big year for AMD My price target for AMD does not require per share earnings even though I do think the company will reach that target easily All the market needs to see is Zen taking market share in desktops and servers and the stock will rise accordingly And that will happen because big customers like HP NYSE HPQ Dell and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY are eagerly awaiting for competition in those semimonopoly markets AMD does not need a superior product to make that happen but just a competitive one After all the company is selling millions of chips with inferior capability NM GPU and CPU products How many more millions will it sell when it has competitive NM products I think a lot more and at higher margins too Another positive for the stock is that it is uncorrelated to the market If the doomsayers are correct and the market falls in the next two years it will not affect AMD much if at all Cloud and enterprise servers in China and elsewhere will continue to sell and upgrade desktops have a renewal cycle all of their own and VR is headed up no matter what I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
