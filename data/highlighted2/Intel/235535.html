smartphone processor which takes the competition with Apple to a new level Apples other main mobile device competitors are joining Samsung in designing their own custom mobile device processors The paradigm shift in the semiconductor industry that Apple NASDAQ AAPL initiated with its custom system on chips SOCs based on ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH technology has reached a critical new phase Apples success in mobile devices has inspired its competition to follow Apples lead Samsung OTCSSNLF Huawei and LG OTCLGEAF are all designing their own custom SOCs The paradigm shift is making commodity processor producers increasingly irrelevant When I first began talking a couple of years ago about the paradigm shift that Apples custom SOCs represented this was met with considerable skepticism and hostility by supporters and investors of the major semiconductor companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM It was assumed that commodity processors would inevitably take over the mobile device industry as they had the PC industry The early skepticism was understandable The business model represented by the PC was attractive for semiconductor makers As a merchant vendor of semiconductors to OEM PC makers the commodity semiconductor company could profit from the competition among the OEMs with little care for which OEM might eventually triumph When Apple announced its first A SOC for the original iPad it was only natural to view this as an aberration The real proof of the importance of the paradigm shift has only begun to emerge in the last year as Apples arch rival Samsung fielded a brace of premium smartphones featuring its own custom designed Exynos processor The featured a bit CPU core design based on ARM CortexA CPUs mated with CortexAs This is ARMs socalled biglittle design in which the CPU switches as needed between the A cores for higher performance or the A cores for low power operation Even this move was greeted as an aberration by Qualcomms supporters who continued to persist in the belief that the commodity semiconductor model would triumph in the end and that Samsung would adopt a Qualcomm processor for its nextgeneration Galaxy S With the announcement of the Samsung Exynos series processor any hope for a return by Qualcomm to the Galaxy now lies in utter ruin What Samsung is doing is exactly what I predicted when the Exynos appeared in the Galaxy S Having embraced the custom SOC paradigm in order to be more competitive with Apple there was no turning back Samsung has now been joined by most of Apples major competitors Huawei has had its own whollyowned subsidiary HiSilicon designing custom ARM processors for some time The latest in the series the Kirin is expected to power the next generation of premium Huawei devices In addition LG is rumored to be working on its own secondgeneration custom SOC referred to as the Nuclun which will feature ARM CortexA CPU cores Were seeing a process where the entire mobile device industry is following in Apples wake Its a tremendous validation of the decision Steve Jobs made years ago to invest in SOC design and development Its easy to lose the big picture ramifications of the moves by Apples competitors Daniel Eran Dilger was so busy trashing Samsung and trying to prove how superior Apple is why is that even necessary at this point that he completely missed the significance of the Exynos The Exynos is the first time any Apple competitor has gone beyond just using ARM CPU designs to using a selfdeveloped CPU design The Exynos will use a similar core configuration as its predecessor but the more powerful of the CPUs which had been ARM designs will be replaced by proprietary Samsung designs Apple has been designing its own CPU cores for years AAPL was able to get the drop on the smartphone industry by introducing its own bit processor the A in the iPhone s and there wouldnt be a competing bit processor for almost a year This is one of the advantages of doing a deeper custom SOC design The other key advantage is that the custom CPU can be higher performance than the generic ARM designs There had been rumors of a Samsung SOC with custom CPUs dubbed Mongoose for some time but I was a little surprised by the Samsung Exynos announcement I had expected Samsung to keep using ARM designs for at least another product cycle The Exynos takes the competition in ARM SOC design to a whole new level Among the mobile device makers there will now be a new ARMs race to achieve custom CPU designs Even as recently as last March when I wrote Apple Becoming A Semiconductor Powerhouse I received many skeptical comments At the time I pointed out that the Ax of the iPad Air offered comparable performance to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core MY an observation that was widely derided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>fans Now this theme is being taken up and expanded upon Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company has noted that the even more powerful Ax in the iPad Pro surpasses the performance of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core M processor used in the inch MacBook and compares favorably to the Core i in the base MacBook Air Samsungs following in Apples lead only demonstrates how Apple has seized the initiative in semiconductor design and innovation The impact of that is to make the mobile aspirations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>increasingly irrelevant As I pointed out recently Apples new A processor in the iPhone s is already better than the Atom X tablet processor Intels ambitions of getting into smartphones are rapidly receding in the rear view mirror of the major smartphone manufacturers They all know that the key to future success will be custom ARM SOCs not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside Even the commodity ARM processor makers are threatened by the new ARMs race Companies such as Qualcomm are in nearly as much danger of becoming irrelevant as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is Qualcomm is currently looking for adjacent markets such as IoT but it needs a totally new business model Should Apples investors be concerned about the increased imitation of Apple by Samsung and other AAPL competitors Not at all Apple is on its third generation of selfdesigned bit CPU in the A Apples performance still appears to be better in singlecore Geekbench scores than the new Exynos This tends to translate into real world performance advantages as demonstrated by other benchmarks more rooted in realworld tasks such as Web page loading data encryption etc Also Apple has a profound advantage by controlling both the operating system and the SOC design Control of the OS allows AAPL to fully exploit its CPU design in a way that using Android doesnt allow for Apples competitors Apple has been doing exactly what it needs to do to win the new ARMs race Apple has hugely expanded RD in the past few years In calendar Q RD spending was about billion By the most recent fiscal Q quarter RD had doubled to billion And Apple can put its huge cash reserves to good use in other ways such as investing in capital equipment for its chipmaking partner TSMC NYSE TSM Part of my recent caution about Apple was due to the expectation of its competitors fielding new custom ARM SOCs Now that the world has gotten a better look at these competing SOCs Im much less concerned about them I remain long Apple and
