we automated the pagination another jobs gone Then we purchased two Kodak digital Metal Plate imagers This eliminated the need for film and nearly the entire prepress department positions are gone It now takes people to do the work did Whats worse is IT is now done remotely and the three IT guys left on sight we use to call them the Maytag men are now the three who run the plate imagers while on

bulk of those whove dropped out of Americas industrial work force These are the folks who the young services industry workers making bucks an hour are replacing Its not just burger flippers loosing

my business most of that efficiency goes towards lowering my price to stay competitive to get work Its a race to the bottom Like the printer said the technology doesnt necessarily mean a better
