class='textDiv'>Micron And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Occams Razor Micron Technology Inc NASDAQMU Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long MU INTC ENERQ MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I apologize for my previous accusations regarding Microns management MU is likely breaking up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>After my last article I went absolutely off the rails and accused Microns NASDAQ MU management of purposefully running the company into the ground Subsequent to the companys most recent chalcogenide disclosure I no longer believe that to be true In philosophy a razor is a tool that allows one to shave off unlikely explanations Among those Occams Razor often provides me with the most utility Intels NASDAQ INTC management is indicating that D XPoint XP is the best thing since canned beer and itll be using it in across a broad portfolio of products from the datacenter down to lowpower ultrabooks But MUs management indicates just the opposite that XP revenue will not be significant until There is a simple explanation for this that nobody has suggested to this point Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are going through a messy breakup Ive stared at the data long enough for this to make sense so allow me to walk you through this I was surprised that there were no questions about fabrication size during the initial XP announcement So I specifically remember when this was discussed at the Pacific Crest event shortly thereafter While this recording has expired the question of fabrication size was asked directly and the answer was curious to me It was explained that the XP chips have no transistors so the traditional basis for measuring the fabrication size was impossible But it did go on to explain that if there were transistors theyd be nanometers in size Unlike traditional memory like DRAM and Flash XP chips have no integrated control logic circuitry While I outlined in The Shining Briefcase it is possible to use the Ovonic Quantum Control in order to replace transistors at the logic level that is a huge leap And theres nothing in the patent mill to show any work to this end I think the simple explanation is that the XP chips dont have any logic onboard This leaves only one conclusion Back when the Hybrid Memory Cube HMC was initially proposed D stacking was a requirement But this requirement disappeared with the advent of much more affordable D interposer technology What youre looking at here take special note of the integrated FPGA controller is a planar D version of the HMC It should be noted that back when the HMC was first disclosed DRAM replacement was a goal From the same presentation The propeller heads in the world of highperformance computing HPC live in an academic dream world and often forget that theyve signed nondisclosure agreements Theyve been discussing this openly for many years now just use a small amount of DRAM in order to mitigate the downsides of PCM This appears to be Intels upcoming Knights Landing HPC processor Also relevant from this presentation is a slide that nicely illustrates that DRAM like Flash is at endoflife beyond Gb densities It is important to note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>owns the fundamental patent on the Hybrid Memory Cube which specifically cites PCM even though it doesnt participate in the HMC consortium The goal here is obvious an expensive proprietary Intelonly memory standard INTC really has no competition outside of the mobile space and XP will fix that so it will necessarily command some very steep prices for its integrated products Id certainly line up to give it my money at this point And everyone will once they understand how revolutionary it is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a lock on pretty much everything with respect to XP without the FPGA control technology the current chips are worthless to Micron Micron will need to develop or purchase some control technology so that it can sell the chips to nonIntel customers This is not in INTCs interest and it is going to cost MU a fortune so I had expected to see an exclusive IntelMicron joint venture announcement Instead we see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>going it alone with D NAND and XP at its Dalian fab In the past itd just say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>without beating around the bush But INTC is now making its own chips outside of IMFT so we know that something else is going on here When I was researching Purple Swan last June I came across a Toshiba OTCPKTOSYY job posting that discussed Toshibas upcoming nonvolatile memory NVM replacement for DRAM This was obviously curious knowing Toshibas affinity for phase change memory PCM But I couldnt think of anything to link this in until now From Microns US patent application This is a stacked PCM that is implemented using a Toshiba technology called BitCost Scalable BiCS This is the technology that the industry is using to produce D NAND and Toshiba generates a tidy sum from the royalties The big advantage is that all of the memory cells in the D stack are fabricated simultaneously using the same fab deposition steps And only a single bit line is required for each bitrow of stacked cells XP is a traditional lithographyintense memory technology each layer needs to be fabricated individually so it is a lot more expensive than the new D NAND In a fourlayer stack of cells youd need to spend nearly four times the amount of time to create XP versus this BiCS implementation In Samsung OTCSSNLF outlined that D XPoint yes it used this term in wasnt ideal from a cost perspective Click to enlargeIf Im spending billion on a fab and depreciating half of that over three years this works out to more than second in overhead Certainly theres a lot of things happening in parallel but you get the picture equipment depreciation is the dominant cost of a semiconductor When I predicted XP in Purple Swan I had anticipated that this BiCS structure would be the flavor announced by Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>When the more primitive structure was presented instead I assumed that there may be some manufacturing or performance issue with the BiCSstyle cell I realize now that BiCS is a Toshiba technology and there is a lot of power and politics behind it If you investigate Microns D NAND patent applications youll find that it is similar in complexity to the PCM pictured above Click to enlargeTheres no reason to produce D NAND or D XPoint if you have the rights to produce BiCS PCM I dont believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has those rights and as such has only a shortterm solution with D XPoint It will prove very costly but I believe that Micron and Toshiba will prevail in the long term with their BiCS PCM which can be produced in much greater density think layers instead of two or four Most recently Toshiba appears to be prepping for this change In the distance Samsung is building a billion fab just as DRAM and NAND are hitting their end of life I have nothing here but I find this curious and see a potential partnership Dont get me wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to do just fine with its walled garden packaged processormemorystorage products And it has many aspects of transactional memory locked up This alone cost it a fortune its years ahead And the company is doing a great job of playing a highstakes game of chicken against Micron see the MU share price for reference I used to believe that Microns FPGA technology acquisitions of Pico and Convey were to complement Intels Altera acquisition ie Micron was working with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I realize now that these are likely adversarial Micron needs to build its own FPGA hybrid memory controllers in order to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to this end Perhaps well see a MicronXilinx NASDAQ XLNX partnership soon Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>have its implementation of the HMC locked up with patents As outlined in The Shining Briefcase this makes ECDs Ovonic Cognitive Computer OCC entity even more key as Microns Ovonyx subsidiary only possesses rights to discrete standalone PCM products The value in transistorless PCM is that you can integrate it into a CPU and sell billions of IoT processormemorystorage devices every year As a side note I should inform everyone of my relationship with the ECD bankruptcy Im being kept at arms length in order to keep me independent as a journalist I get lots of questions about whats going on with respect to ECD but I have no idea outside of what is posted here Noteworthy of late is that the closing was again delayed to March th My assumption is that the sale of OCC is being wrapped up and lots of things will transpire quickly once that is finished My gut feeling is that Micron may be acquired by any one of a number of suitors with a contingency on the OCC deal But I would like to ask MUs management to remain independent as long as possible indefinitely if possible This will help shareholders to realize optimal value I will say that I see lots of ECD technology that is awaiting the closure of its bankruptcy Phase change window film epaper and display technology for example were recently announced by Oxford and Exeter spinoff Bodle Technology ECDs chalcogenide display technology now owned by Micron will obsolesce current LCD LED OLED and ePaper displays a market of billion annually A current K television has just megapixels due to the tremendous limitations of thinfilm transistors But ECDs Ovonic Quantum Control device solves all of those limitations albeit creating a definite bandwidth issue building displays with billions of pixels will become a possibility Or smartphone displays that transform from backlit to color ePaper when youre out in the sunlight And it will create a new market for energyefficient windows Imagine a window film that can change from translucent to reflective in order to reflect sunlight on a hot day but allow it in as solar heat on a cold day Bodle Technologies is being very secretive about who it is working with but this Samsung PCM display patent application should shed some light Look familiar This is nearly identical to the image from Bodles website Because Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>are bringing chalcogenides into mass production that will place them as leading contenders to commercialize this work as well The fundamental patents in Ovonic display are expired so like PCM only specific implementations will be patentable And then there is Ovonic optical routing With todays technology it takes about milliseconds to get data from Los Angeles to New York The vast majority of the mile trip is performed over fiber optic cable The speed of light is miles per second so in an alloptical situation this trip should require less than milliseconds Theres more than milliseconds of overhead in opticalelectricaloptical conversion That is in order to traverse thousands of miles the electrical data needs to be converted to optical But at each hop ie every major city it needs to be converted back into electrical so that it can be routed by an electricitybased processor With Ovonic optical routing this does not need to happen The world is about to get a lot smaller from a communication perspective And Micron now owns the fundamental patents on this technology Compute artificial intelligence storage display communications and energy the advent of massproduced optoelectric chalcogenide has sweeping implications And Microns chalcogenide announcement reveals that this is finally happening after years of research I believe that this will be more transformative than anything else that I will see in my lifetime Unfortunately a substantial portion of my net worth just expired with the January Micron calls I realize now that this is not something that is easily understood but is now very much an opportunity for those who can Im still buying Micron LEAPS with the hope that I can recover some portion of what I have squandered in ECD and now Micron I apologize for getting anyone involved I absolutely believe everything that Im putting out there Unfortunately I realize now that Wall Street cant possibly understand this technology until it happens Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
