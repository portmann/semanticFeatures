Is Still A Buy Despite Being Up Over Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD gained market share in Q from NVIDIA despite shortages in its new Fury line Despite going up over since I first advised people to buy AMD the stock is a buy Its been a little more than a month since I wrote an article on AMD NASDAQ AMD and a few months since I mentioned it was a good stock to purchase In that time its gone up over while many have advised how the company is in a death spiral or otherwise was heading for death Unfortunately for many readers its difficult to know who to believe so opportunities are missed Understanding the technology market is not simple or easy and many writers use general ideas based on vague notions that are often applicable in similar situations I will explain a few that are advanced and why they are sometimes misguided and not entirely applicable I will also comment on some news events since my last article One of the least plausible lines of reasoning involves AMD going out of business before it can release its new product line This is so patently false I feel silly even mentioning it but it should be addressed Many of the losses AMD has suffered this year are paper losses not operating losses so using those figures is intentionally misleading More than that even using that rate the company would still have enough cash or flexible credit to have time to release the next generation x core and GPU architecture Another somewhat related fallacy involves the impact of AMDs shrinking RD budget on its ability to remain in business A corollary to this is that companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and NVIDIA NASDAQ NVDA by virtue of their larger RD budgets will always make better products Or the similarly poor remarks about how AMD is stretching itself too thin by competing with both companies Of course the latter is why AMD defeated both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and NVIDIA and won this generation of consoles It could not be more false or easily proven so In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does not have GPU technology anywhere near that of AMD or NVIDIA and NVIDIA lacks the CPU prowess of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or AMD leaving AMD perfectly situated to take advantage of their ability in both technologies There is also a belief that having more money to develop a processor will always make it better This is clearly not true as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has released several poor processors like the Pentium and Atom despite enormous budgets and smaller companies have released superior technology at times AMD being one of them Processors are expensive to make and are getting more expensive but after a certain point more money will not make a significant difference With this in mind AMDs Zen processor will not be impacted by a shortage of cash or be inferior because it came from a company with less money than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>AMD has more than enough money to fund Zen provided it was a priority as we know it has been AMDs next generation GPU architecture will also have received proper funding to complete the design In neither case would more funding make a significant difference in the product Of course when one has a lower RD budget something has to be lost It is not like the money spent before was all wasted although certainly some waste can be eliminated In AMDs case there are some obvious cases where the smaller RD budget became very apparent Very obvious was backing off some commitments to ARM which has shown very clear delays The Seattle launch was significantly behind schedule and the K was pushed back at least until from We similarly saw the cancellation of Project Skybridge and the appearance of a nm planar JaguarPuma derivative The smaller RD budget was also very likely responsible for the lack of new technology from AMD on the nm planar node although we did get tweaks Compared to NVIDIAs updates they are quite minor by comparison So there is an impact but its not as significant as many would like it to appear The company can live with pushing ARM back since its not doing well in servers yet or living with the existing GCN architecture a bit longer than it wanted to It could not live with compromising the big releases in and those have not been impacted It is always important to remember that although the company has been impacted by RD cuts it still has the capability of prioritizing the most important projects Since my last article over a month ago there have been quite a few news items regarding AMD which overall are very favorable We already knew AMD gained market share in the PC market in Q but now we have reports from Jon Peddie research indicating the company gained market share in the discrete GPU market as well Although an increase from to may seem minor it is important to remember that AMD was suffering from shortages in its new Fury line nor were all the products available for the entire quarter AMD has also fleshed out its new line with the R which has been wellreceived and offers gamers a solid choice in a heretofore ignored price segment With DX titles coming which early tests show favoring AMDs GPU technology more than NVIDIAs it seems a foregone conclusion AMD will continue to gain market share in GPUs despite a now old architecture We have also seen the release of AMDs new software suite which has been very wellreceived despite being quite new and having some issues The performance of the software the intuitiveness of the interface and the additional features have all received praise over AMDs previous Catalyst software AMDs Boltzmann Initiative similarly shows a focus in software releasing a suite of tools designed to assist developers in leveraging AMDs GPUs for computational purposes To go with compilers AMD also has a tool HIP to assist developers in porting NVIDIAs CUDA code to C which can then leverage AMDs products We also have the news from AMD indicating that the company has first silicon with Global Foundries on the nm FinFET technology and that Zen has met expectations Its easy to see why the price of the stock has continued to go up none of these are signals from a dying company Astute investors knew AMD would have a very rough and so it happened Other things we will not know until with accuracy like how well Zen and the next GPU core will perform But there have been many positives in Weve seen the very successful FreeSync initiative Weve seen very competitive GPU products in the Fury line despite an aging architecture Weve seen successful silicon on GFs nm FinFET Weve seen the company successfully leverage Mantle to create other APIs that finally can leverage the capabilities of AMDs GPU architecture while making porting from consoles much easier in the process Weve seen the company successfully increase corporate market share with its CPUs Weve seen the company to continue to improve Professional GPU market share Weve seen AMD continue its important relationship with Apple NASDAQ AAPL And weve seen AMD finally focus more on software and show positive results in these efforts Perhaps most importantly weve seen the company make the correct decisions in most cases and prioritize important technologies while delaying or eliminating less important ones Although many readers may have missed out on the opportunity of buying this company very low when I wrote my article on why it was a buy its still very attractive long term at this price However shortterm drops are more likely now so investors should have a fairly long time horizon All in all while you will continue to have people pointing out this or that issue or losses in revenue could play out no other way The surprises were largely positive and the companys longterm strategy has started to play out and will continue to as we move forward However will still be difficult although better than especially as we get to the latter half In the company will have a real chance to improve earnings dramatically but we should know in how likely this is That is when we can assess AMDs newest technology generation which should dictate much of what will happen in the following years
