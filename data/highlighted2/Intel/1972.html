expectations have been withdrawn On Thursday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC announced startling news that guided revenue for Q down to BB below prior guidance of BB That guidance was presented just a few weeks ago on January th In my two previous articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in February here and here I warned that the enthusiastic projections of Intels business for were fraught with potential problems Well the problems have already started Intels famous year transistor lead is meaningless to shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is famous for telling investors and anyone else who will listen how far ahead technically they are compared to their competitors Heres a chart <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>created to show their superiority Lets compare the Transistor chart with Intels stock price over the last years This second chart shows that every year for the last ten the NASDAQ composite has outperformed the Greatest Chip Manufacturer in the History of the World So how exactly did shareholders benefit from this supposed superiority Well the fact is they didnt because the technical superiority did not translate into shareholder value And then there is the PE ratio for the Greatest Chip Manufacturer in the History of the World That is pretty pathetic too And pity the poor guy who bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares on July at the highprice of the day compared to a price right now on March of If he is still holding those shares he has a gain of less than after almost years of technical superiority How did other chip manufacturers do over that same time period Well lets look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>competitor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM who supposedly has been three years behind in technical prowess for the last years at least compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Beating the NASDAQ Composite out of the last ten years sure looks a lot better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>doesnt it Only bad management can bring such mediocre results to a great company As I have said repeatedly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a great even iconic American company But in spite of all the technological advancements they have introduced to the semiconductor industry they have consistently overpromised and underdelivered That can only result from bad management decisions The current CEO seems to lack focus spending too much time on making drones or introducing smart bracelets kind of chunky rather than managing his billion company And that company basically makes of its profits on legacy products for desktops and w servers both of which will increasingly come under market pressure over the next two years The first quarter revision amply demonstrates that the legacy side of the business needs more attention than bracelets and drones And CFO Stacy Smith seems to be of the same unfocused bent writing Haikus for each investor day presentation Heres his current one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>likes to brag they have only had CEOs in years Five of them have been engineers including current CEO Brian Krzanich BK and one a financial guy Paul Otellini In addition they have all spent decades with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and in the case of Otellini and Krzanich their entire careers The problem with engineers and financial types is they are internal looking often at their desks looking at either engineering drawings or financial statements Maybe its time for some new outside blood to come in to the corporate suite Perhaps someone more sales and marketing oriented someone who will look outward toward customers rather than inward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to make products customers want to buy right now whether they are leading edge or not Because of the management issues at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>I recommend avoiding the stock for at least the rest of the year There will be plenty of time to reconsider in after the annual CC Of course a management change involving an outsider would immediately perk up my interest After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a great company they just need great management to run it successfully Source <span
