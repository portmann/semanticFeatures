<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Dropped After Earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Intels lack of revenue growth seems unsolvable in the shortterm The companys inability to grow in new segments leaves it at the mercy of macroeconomic conditions in the PC and server markets At first blush Intels NASDAQ INTC earnings seemed pretty benign so the stock dropping almost might seem surprising Clearly not everyone dropped the stock for the same reason but we can review the report and try to identify areas that would weigh on peoples decisions I wrote an article over days ago and generally like to before earnings so I can easily see where my head was at prior and what changed In reality nothing in the earnings really surprised me much It might be the underlying problems with the company getting visibility that caused the minor selloff From a highlevel view revenue was up but operating income and net income were both down and respectively year to year The Client Computing Group was down Data Center Group was up Internet of Things Group up while Software and Services was down The biggest disappointments seem to be the Data Center Group and Internet of Things showing such minor growth If we look closer well see the Client Computing Group unit shipments dropped year to year This was largely offset by ASP increasing over the same period Both of these can explained by the largest drop in volumes being for tablet processors although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management did indicate their product mix was richer in the PC market as well The Data Center Group was reversed with volume up but ASP down Management framed this by saying that this was due to the networking group growing significantly faster than the servers This brings further attention to the fact that even with this fast growth in networking processors the overall volume was up only raising concerns about server processor sales in this segment Intels spin on this was that Q of was very good quarter making relative comparisons challenging This ignores that Q to Q only showed growth so however you spin it volumes were not impressive IoT again showed disappointing growth showing only midsingle digit growth year to year This was supposed to be a strong growth engine for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a year ago and has stalled One point I want to bring up is that Intels revenue forecasts for include revenue for Altera Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has not completely broken down how much they expect from this segment it was revealed that Q revenue was expected to be around million Also consider there will be weeks in for the company the extra being in Q and it is clear that Intels revenue guidance is quite soft So in short Q was a lot like Q Anyone who was hoping Q would show marked improvement was disappointed with the earnings report Investors are beginning to realize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not sure how to expand and management is unable to initiate strategies that lead to successful growth As investors realize what I had a few years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management lacks vision and capability the stock will reflect that The offset of that is the company continues to offer an attractive dividend and actively purchases its own stock all while still being very profitable This makes it an easier pill to swallow but it does not totally exonerate management from its poor performance A lot of Intels situation I covered in my previous article and this one is mainly about earnings but I do want to cover some general points as well One of the points I mentioned in passing was that tablet sales were down If you wanted an example of how badly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management has performed you can look at this Many of us decried Intels aggressive and expensive attempt to force itself into the tablet market at a cost of over billion and climbing It is incredibly obtuse and showed a management that was baffled by market changes and reacted to them rather than understood them While management tries to paint a picture of a richer mix in the Client Computing Group and frame it as a success clearly the salient reason for the increases ASP is the tablet market collapsing on them After spending so much to enter it this hardly seems like a success In fact its an egregious failure that should never have happened As a corollary to that there will be some that will take from the volume decrease that AMD gained CPU market share in Q This probably is not true and if it is it has to be very minor Since the major volume drop was in tablets and the desktop and mobile PC market showed a much lower drop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>effectively maintained market share Skylake continues to be a failure for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Yields are still not high but progressing and the performance improvement is very minor and it has a well publicized bug I know the bug is very minor but even with that on a visceral level I could never buy one now Errata are not uncommon but its one thing to know this and another to actually see a processor exposed for it The emotional side often wins this battle Management also indicated that the depreciation for equipment would be significantly less on the order of billion in due to the lifespan being extended from four years to five years This concerns me because it comes after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has indicated delays in moving to new fabrication technology and this does seem to play into that a bit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management denies this is related though but I am not sure I believe them The disappointing poor performance reminds me of Haswell a processor I was convinced would perform very well when I saw the architecture then was dead wrong when it was released But theres a happy ending to this story Haswell now performs quite well compared to Ivy Bridge whereas when it was released it showed a very minor improvement Obviously software optimizations are ongoing and certainly helped Haswell realize its potential many months after its release The same may hold true for Skylake so while the early returns are poor this does not necessarily mean it is a dud But for now it is Looking a little more broadly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a situation where its performance is largely dictated by the macroeconomics of the markets it is in Although that is causing some pain now it really is best case as it means the company is so dominant in these markets there is not much to be gained that the company does not already have This is not a permanent or unassailable position and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can not do better than the PC market or server market it can do worse Right now the server competitors AMD NASDAQ AMD IBMOpenPOWER NYSE IBM ARM NASDAQ ARMH camp are not seriously impacting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>All three are progressing and could impact Intels server dominance in the future In the PC market AMD products are so far behind Intels they do not compete well in much above the lowerend segment AMDs Zen is clearly an attempt by the company to move its product upstream and considering it is a complete redesign and has been moved to a far superior manufacturing process should have at least some success in doing so Investors now realize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has to grow in other areas and so far earnings after earnings show this is not happening IoT is clearly not growing at a rate the company had hoped for Phones are still languishing although saying its failed is probably premature as is an important year and could turn things around The memory group is still a very small part of the company and even with the all the fanfare around D Xpoint it will not even be monetized until with samples going out in On top of that the market for it will be quite small as it will not replace DRAM too slow or Flash too expensive in the near term although it may be used as such in a small segment of those scenarios Most likely it will find more success in storage class memory first and even there competing technologies are also being released To sum it up the earnings were not really that bad and I think a bigger part of it is that investors hoping the company will start growing again are beginning to lose that hope I believe they are also seeing how poor the management team is But the company is still returning a lot of money to investors still very profitable and still dominant in two very major and profitable markets IoT is not really looking that good but the lowend phone market could start to develop momentum in and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the technology to play effectively there There are dark clouds in the form of better server and PC competition but theyre off in the distance and it is not clear if they will ever materialize enough to rain on Intels parade I would not buy this stock as I can think of companies with better upside but theres also little reason to panic as the company is very stable and profitable I do not believe that is going to change in although we should watch to see how the competition shapes this year to better know what to expect in </div></body></html>
