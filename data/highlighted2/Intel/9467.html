Moving location tracking into chips will enable it to work continuously and universally without draining battery or CPU At the Mobile World Congress MWC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC announced that their new WiFi chips would not only support the latest WiFi standards but also would enable indoor location positioning Currently smartphones stop being able to track their locations when they move indoors because they lose reception of GPS satellite signals Intels new chips will enable phones to track their location indoors as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is often seen as lagging in the mobile arena not yet succeeding in leveraging their success in PC chips in the mobile market Some recent success with their mobile CPU chips and modem chips may be a turning point and this new announcement may signal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>not only catching up on todays mobile chips but jumping ahead on nextgeneration trends GPSbased location services have become ubiquitous on todays smartphones and mobile devices Location is used for a wide variety of mobile apps from mapping and navigation to social networking Location also is used for basic phone features such as picture geotagging and emergency call locating E But GPS only works outdoors so todays phones stop tracking location accurately when they enter the door of a building or underground parking lot They still know what building theyre in but not what floor theyre on or what room theyre in So social networking apps can know youre in the mall but not which store and navigation apps cant help you find your way to the store or office youre looking for A lot has been written about indoor location technology before According to this new report there are over companies currently developing indoor location technology Apple NASDAQ AAPL acquired WiFiSLAM and then brought BLE beacons to the fore Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has supported rudimentary indoor location in Google Maps and major network companies like Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Aruba NASDAQ ARUN and Ruckus Wireless NYSE RKUS all support indoor location tracking But the latest trend with the biggest potential implications is support for indoor location positioning in chips Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has released their IZAT location technology in their chips and Broadcom NASDAQ BRCM has also released chips supporting indoor locat ion Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has entered the fray with support for indoor location positioning in their new WiFi chips Intels indoor location support looks great As this video from the recent Mobile World Congress shows their system is able to track a device as it moves around a site even at a conference with a huge amount of wireless signals The reason this trend is so big is that if location positioning can be done in chips it can be made available in smartphones throughout the market More importantly location positioning done in chips will require much less CPU power and much less battery than if similar location positioning is done in software Most of the companies bringing indoor location technology to market are doing so one site at a time Many stores shopping malls hospitals airports offices and other indoor sites have released applications with indoor mapping and navigation services included But chipbased indoor location capabilities promise to track indoor locations on a universal alwaysworking and alwaysavailable manner Even if these chipbased systems are not as accurate as a system customized for a specific site the very fact that chipbased approaches can work everywhere makes them revolutionary Intels indoor location positioning uses the new mc standard to measure the distance between the device and each WiFi access point nearby It then uses a technique called multilateration to find the exact place thats the right distance from each access point Multilateration has been used for indoor location positioning a lot in the past but chipbased technology such as Intels can measure the distances to each access point a lot more accurately than can be done in software Most softwarebased approaches measure the strengths of the signals from the access points and then convert signal strengths into distance estimates But signal strengths are not accurate determiners of distance because they are impacted by the environment such as being weakened by objects in between an access point and the device But chipbased approaches can measure distance much more accurately One catch is that chipbased approaches need the new chips to be both in the devices and in the WiFi access points which means that it will take some time for these new chips to be able to track locations universally Intels chips can work with any other chips that are mccompliant not only with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips so devices with their chips will have a good chance of being able to track locations as this new standard spreads The new indoor location tracking capabilities of Intels new chips shows Intels entry into this new trend As indoor location positioning chips enter the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be wellpoised alongside Broadcom and Qualcomm to bring location applications indoors Source <span
