class='textDiv'>Steve Jobs Rules The Big Picture Would Tesla have sold a fraction of Model Ss if it looked like the electric cars of yore No it looks like a Ferrari and therefore early adopters who want to look cool purchased it Few knew it goes like stink with acceleration times exceeding all but the highest performance cars but thats secondary to the looks IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY HE WHO HOLDS BACK IS COOLEST Its not only Jobs but Beyonce who dropped her new album unannounced a couple of Christmases back Sure if youre a nobody youve got to get the word out But once youre a somebody youre better off proffering less information Adele gets this Sure there was monstrous hype when came out but before thatcrickets If we cant know what we want to know were ever more curious Thats right Steve Jobs wore the same damn thing whenever he was in public Whereas the fading Hollywood stars line up with designers and the public fawns at cheap fashion which is fodder for the masses Functionality rules Hell wasnt there that campaign <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside If someone is brushing up their exterior to impress you know that theyre insecure and dont get it IGNORE THE HATERS UNTIL THEY GET TRACTION Steve and Apple never responded they rarely do this day until the sound becomes deafening Remember the iPhone fracas about the lack of reception depending upon how you held the device An exasperated Steve Jobs took time from his holiday in Hawaii to say it was irrelevant and give free bumpers to everyone and thats the last you heard of it A broad product line just confuses the customer Sure you can customize change horsepower and RAM but when Steve returned to Apple there were so many models that buyers couldnt make sense of them Give people too much choice and they dont buy at all Were in a dark era where TV remotes still have a ton of buttons allinones dont work and its everharder to use too many devices this is the downfall of Android every device is different Keep It Simple Stupid Techies will always want to put in more features Isnt it funny that the power users have bitched ad infinitum that Apples devices were not customizable to the nth degree but its Microsofts Windows that has faded and apps are developed for the iOS platform first Dont cater to the bleeding edge itll make your company crater Apple is the most valuable company in the world PICK YOUR SUCCESSOR AND MAKE IT STICK I can complain all day long about Tim Cook but Steve chose him and hes remained at the helm theres no doubt about whos in charge as opposed to the fiasco at Disney with Thomas Staggs Youve got to present a unified front to the outside Furthermore Steve told Tim not to look back but forward thats how Disney got in trouble in the first place by asking what Walt would do well Walt was dead and didnt live in a changed world so his values may have been important but as for his direction who knows KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN I know this sounds contradictory but the truth is Jobs worked the press all successful corporate stars work the press they maintain relationships no matter what is said and cull favors and coverage Burn relationships with the press at your peril And know that the press is poorly paid and if you give them a first class experience a peek an exclusive theyre thrilled and will be on your team Who knew what Steve Jobs owned what his everyday lifestyle was about Only nitwits are accumulating houses and cars to impress others under the mistaken impression that theyve won Youve got to love your work and love to do it Millennials know its all about access oldsters think its about ownership But the youth rule in the future always BETTER TO GET IT RIGHT THAN BE FIRST The iPod was not the first MP player and there was other music jukebox software before iTunes If youre caught behind you may not have lost as long as you leapfrog the competition by doing something better Whether it be the legacy ports that were axed on the iMac or the CDROM drives that were left off of later computers or the killing of the iPod by the iPhone Jobs refused to be shackled to the past This is the music businesss Achilles heel always trying to protect what was in a world that doesnt care Now its trying to protect MPs when the truth is Napster was nearly twenty years ago PEOPLE FORGIVE YOU WHEN YOU PUT THE PRODUCT AHEAD OF YOURSELF For all the bs about what a tyrant Steve Jobs was the truth is Apple employees stayed on because they wanted to work on insanely great products Steve was less about selfaggrandizement than product aggrandizement The little things count Sometimes makes all the difference Dont sacrifice the product just to avoid hurting someones feelings It was clear who was in charge at too many companies its not Steve Jobs is already in the rearview mirror Those who lived through the first decade of this century will never forget him but the products he championed are already in the process of being superseded and unlike music once your products are gone youre done But that does not undercut his legacy Jobs took on the big boy and won Thats right Steve neutered Microsoft And Steve was a new kind of CEO he believed in his products and sold them himself his personal enthusiasm made you want to buy Hell look at the present Apple presentations theyre flat because no ones got the same showmanship Tim Cook should defer to Craig Federighi or another employee with personality as opposed to dully hosting these presentations himself hell if Jony Ive can only be on tape maybe Cook should only be too And too often we lose the thread we experience greatness and then leave it behind He who proffers easy to use products that do their job and look cool will win in the end But too often companies ship too early or compromise the product or decide by committee and the result fails Barry L Ritholtz is the founder and chief investment officer of
