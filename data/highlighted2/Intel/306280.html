coverage of more than stocks many of which have little or no coverage elsewhere The story at Applied Micro today is pretty much the same as it was a few years ago and thats not a good thing HP seems to have stopped playing up its Moonshot server and investor excitement around AMCC has faded somewhat yet the stock still trades at a robust multiple A revenue ramp based on XGene is promised for late calendar but previous expectations have not materialized meaningfully While bulls will undoubtedly say that theres a massive opportunity here if XGene can steal even a few percent of Intels share that hope seems to be priced in If the company does not demonstrate the viability of its technology via significant revenue from production silicon shares could have much further to fall Oh Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC So much potential allegedly yet so little execution Ive followed the company for several years now As a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC shareholder I thought it was worth monitoring the muchhyped but yet to materialize threat of ARMbased servers replacing x If youre not familiar the argument revolved around the technical differences between RISC reduced instructionset computing and CISC complex instruction set computing Intels x architecture uses the latter while ARM NASDAQ ARMH chips use the former Bulls and ARM claim that CISC is extraordinarily inefficient and ARM chips are inherently more efficient With server owners highly focused on total cost of ownership and perfwattdollar ARM chips were supposed to be the datacenter equivalent of a gassipping Prius replacing a hulking belching F At first the story was that ARM could take over all of the data center then it was scaled back to microservers that could represent of the TAM and now its something most companies have stopped talking about Indeed Applied Micro bulls and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>bears pointed to Hewlett Packard Enterprises NYSE HPE Moonshot server which had a bit ARM version that was supposed to be revolutionary It was quite the engineering marvel HP used to discuss this all the time on calls and investor presentations but strangely my research tool cant find a reference in their call transcripts since September Coincidentally if you google HP ARM all the first page results are from September For a technology thats supposedly going to revolutionize the data center its a little odd that its biggest proponent has gone radio silent isnt it The bull case for Applied Micro has always been that even a little tiny slice of the Inteldominated server market would be worth a whole lot but unfortunately despite a lot of big words AMCC has not delivered on the execution side Since the company hasnt received much coverage on Seeking Alpha since Ashraf Eassas good work I thought Id give investors an update on the story Summary its the same as it always has been and thats not a good thing HP may have stopped talking up ARM servers but that hasnt deterred Applied Micro from highlighting other big wins One of the first things that Applied Micros CEO Dr Paramesh Gopi highlighted on the recent call was a seemingly benchmark validation of the technology by the European Union Im excited to report that as announced last Monday XGene was chosen as the sole ARM server solution for the European Union Supercomputing Hyperscale Initiative The European market is demonstrating that it wants an alternative to x and APM was chosen amongst all of the other ARM server providers XGene is clearly the best alternative to x and superior to the competition in HPC and hyperscale environments with our enterprisehardened industryleading products This decisive win is testimony to our superior product and technology offering versus other ARM competitors It sounds impressive until you actually dig into the details Not having heard of this initiative I followed the paper trail and ended up reading this Horizon is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly billion of funding available over years to in addition to the private investment that this money will attract It promises more breakthroughs discoveries and worldfirsts by taking great ideas from the lab to the market The million EUR in funding that AMCC will achieve is sixtenths of onehundredth of one percent of the total funding available under the Horizon program Paging through the details of the Horizon program it appears to be something of a governmentsponsored venture capital fund throwing bits of money at lots of different buzzwordy technologies and hoping some stick For example here is the table of contents for just the Information and Communication Technologies program under Horizon Link here I think Smart Anything Everywhere Initiative and gaming and gamification tell you a lot about what sort of project Horizon is While Applied Micro is making it sound like the EU is desperately seeking an alternative to x and believes XGene is just the thing to cure all that ails it my take as an analyst is that someone within the EU bureaucracy decided that XGene was a good enough story to give them a trivial amount of money in the context of the total program Indeed that is and has been my problem with the AMCC XGene story Its just that A story It seems somewhat facile to on the one hand tout that the company is receiving what amounts to venture funding from the EU while on the other hand stating that the upcoming XGene will be comparable to Intels E and E and the highest performance per watt provided by any singlesocket platform These are direct quotes from Dr Gopi on the conference call he went on to say that XGene is seeing excellent traction and will deploy with mega data center players later this year At some point though this story has to turn into commercial revenue from production silicon not just grant funding In July Dr Gopi stated that XGene had twothirds of the performance of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Xeon E at of the total cost of ownership seemingly a very strong value proposition enough to land big clients As of today XGene is production silicon that is shipping for revenues per the conference call and yet AMCC revenues have yet to show any sort of meaningful ramp This I should note is in spite of the fact that the baselegacy business has now stabilized and is no longer a drag The company has sequentially increased revenue for four quarters as it noted on the call but thats hardly saying much when you zoom out a bit Indeed while Intels datacenter results have been well below their targeted CAGR theyre still growing for the full year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>DCG revenue was up comprised of volume and price Total DCG revenue was B If XGene was as competitive as ARM claimed why couldnt it capture say merely half a percent of Intels sales This meager piece of business a few pilot projects really would equate to MM of incremental revenue annually Even Dr Gopi admits that a little adoption would go a long way again heres a verbatim quote from January If you take that one hyperscale customer that youre talking about that does servers a year today those are all essentially P <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>type servers The point there is that a small delta in their buying pattern would mean a very large delta in our revenue pattern With the base business stabilized then you would expect XGene sales to really start shining through They havent so far While the company is now talking about material revenue later in this isnt the first time by my count that theyve promised big things In the Q call in April in response to an analyst question about XGene revenue in Dr Gopi discussed purchase orders in hand and concluded that we are on track to make sure that there is going to be a fairly important and I will call it notable deployment at the end customers and with the OEMs towards the second half of our fiscal year Here we are months later with the Q report in hand and I dont see any revenue that I would call notable as an analyst That it seems will have to wait until fiscal late calendar And this isnt even the first delay from the original timeline you can go all the way back to the Q call in July and find this from the sample to first revenues meaningful revenues is about a year and weve always said that expect revenue in our fiscal calendar fiscal Will the third time be the charm Given the track record of empty promises here I find it hard to be optimistic Notwithstanding AMCCs claims about superior technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is delivering strong results right now and AMCC isnt and as I discussed here the Altera deal only strengthens Intels position in the datacenter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is willing to throw a lot of money around both through organic RD and acquisition to protect this critical piece of their business Theyre not snoozing and any share gains AMCC manages to achieve if there are any will likely be very hard fought The problem with AMCC is that if you take away XGene and its sister products theres really not much left The base business has stabilized for now but the stock is still trading at times trailing revenues and theyre right around their revenue breakeven point which they have lowered to the low million from previously They have plenty of cash on the balance sheet so theres no immediate concern if they continue to burn cash here but with all thats going on in China an important endmarket for server chips there could well be a scenario where the companys revenues dont grow or in fact pull back prolonging and deepening the cash burn Even with a flat revenue scenario I would point out that the stock still prices in XGene optionality As such theres still room for more downside if the market concludes the XGene story is broken rather than delayed Despite a lack of material profitability or demonstrated growth from XGene the stock is still trading at a fairly robust multiple relative to its year history As such absent execution with XGene it could easily retrace to a valuation at or below x revenues If material XGene revenues dont materialize later this year given that the product is said to be comparable to Xeon EE on performance and loads better on TCO then what hope will be left If you have a chip thats claimed to be just as good much more power efficient and it doesnt sell in any meaningful quantity its hard to assign much valuation to it Obviously if XGene or or or does end up taking even a few percent of the server market at any sort of reasonable operating margins then that would be worth a lot And the company has other shots on goal HeliX XWeave XTend that could all be big Thats the bull thesis here But when the product keeps getting better according to management and yet revenues keep getting pushed out whats the appeal of buying at a price that already bakes in some success Management says there is increasing momentum but this has yet to show up in the financials in a way Id consider meaningful To paraphrase one of my favorite CEOs ideas there are lots of great ideas in the world but execution is what matters That in so many words is the problem with Applied Micro I will recant my words if the company can translate its claimed product superiority into meaningful revenue lift However in light of stiff competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and a perpetual nextyear story told by management the likelihood of meaningful XGene adoption doesnt seem to be anywhere close to high enough to justify
