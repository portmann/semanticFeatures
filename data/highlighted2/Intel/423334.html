Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recognizes that the PC replacement cycle has gone from or years to or years but ignores that smartphones have replaced the PC for personal use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recognizes that there will continue to be private and public cloud replacementgrowth but ignores that traditional enterprise servers are dying This article will focus on three <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC replacement cycle items that will continue to negatively affect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock value in the short term These three are PCs traditional enterprise servers and CEO These three replacement cycle items became very clear after reading the transcript of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporations CEO Brian Krzanich Presents at Sanford C Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference and more importantly listening to the actual interview I have followed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>closely for several years at times investing heavily I am currently not invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and am looking for the right opportunity It is clear to me that such an opportunity is not right now I will watch for opportunities later this year In general I was very disappointed with Brian Krzanichs explanations in the Bernstein interview One general observation Brian Krzanich feels that Intels future lies in replacement cycles specifically new technology replacing older technology Generally I think he is right Brian cited several reasons for the slowing of the PC replacement cycle from or years to or years These focused on the slowing pace of innovation and the need for more innovation in PCs to drive PC sales He ignored and did not mention the impact that smartphones have had on PC sales Sure we need PCs to perform work but there are many people that used to by a PC for nonwork purposes that now rely on their smartphone for internet access email and other nonwork items To me ignoring this impact on PC sales is like sticking your head in the sand On the other hand as a CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to admit such an oversight would not be good for ones career The previous manager of PC division Kirk Skaugen had several titles over a couple of years was trying to address the need for more innovation by bringing to the PC wireless chargingdocking no passwords and natural interface These three items never made it into widespread production due to technical challenges Now the previous PC division manager is gone I need to give some credit here The concept of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>replacing its own processor with a new processor does work and can be accelerated for work type PCs A or year replacement cycle is more realistic During this or years new work PC processors will likely have new features that make replacement compelling Note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>here is competing against itself to replace its own processors Smartphones are the replacement for many PCs that are not used for work This fact will continue to result in a decline in PC sales that exceeds Intels estimates not a good thing Enterprise is more complicated Here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>clearly replaces itself to buy new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processors clients must be convinced that the total cost of ownership including buying the new equipment will be less for the new generation of processor compared to continuing to use the existing equipment no capital cost This is a high bar and requires dramatic technological improvements to keep replacements moving at a pace that can achieve growth year over year Recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>technological advancements have been slow to get to market This has negatively impacted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>replacement cycles in the Data Center There are some exciting new technologies that have been in the works for several years that when they make it to production will result in more replacements Maybe this will be later this year and more likely in and See my previous article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Slump in and Thrive in My main negative point is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is ignoring the traditional servers that used to occupy almost every office These servers are being replaced by the cloud Many by the public cloud and some by the private cloud Companies are not buying new servers to replace old servers Brian noted that most small to medium companies are moving to the public cloud because they like not having to worry about their own IT equipment Sure gateway type equipment is still needed in offices but this is a lower level of processor than what was included in traditional servers Ignoring the fact that traditional servers are being replaced by much more efficient public cloud processors is a huge headwind for Data Center sales Reduced sales of traditional server processors brings down overall DCG sales even though sales of cloud processors is growing rapidly I used to be impressed by Brians presentations and his understanding of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and its direction Now not so much I see two reasons for this change First I know more now about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>than I did in past years so I know when he is blowing smoke Second Brian is not as cohesive and sharp as he was in past years Read the transcript and listen to the interview to come to your own conclusion Bad day This lack of clarity guessing at answers and ignorance of negatives affecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been growing over the last year If I was an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Board member Id be looking around for a new CEO as part of improving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>through replacement cycles Recent advancements within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provide a couple of choices Dr Venkata Murthy Renduchintala President of Client Internet of Things NYSEMKT IOT Businesses Systems Architecture Group and Executive Vice President is one option I have yet to hear an actual public presentation by Murthy so I doubt he is ready for prime time The other inside option is Diane M Bryant executive vice president and general manager of the successful Data Center Group Diane I see as a more likely candidate for CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Her presentations are thorough easy to follow and factual Her responses to questions are cohesive factual and easy to follow The Greek god Apollo gave Cassandra the power of prophecybut when she refused him he spat into her mouth to inflict a curse that nobody would ever believe her prophecies People that have worked closely with me for a number of years have told me that I am like Cassandra I often have good foresight into the future but nobody will believe me The choice is yours A challenge is using these insights to figure out which way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock will go in the future The first two declining cycles PC and traditional servers will clearly be a drag on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earnings This drag could be significant for the next few months and possibly decreasing over the next two years as the DCG IoT and memory businesses grow The impact of a change in CEO is more challenging to estimate Maybe a change would be seen as a negative a failure of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The result could be a drop in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock Maybe the CEO replacement could be seen as a recognition of a need to change and the willingness to change and therefore be a positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock There will be a huge effort to make such a change a positive event for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>so my thinking is that such an announcement will likely be positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price I continue to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>stock price dropping to or over the next several months before it starts its rise to above over the next couple of years I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long
