that were most on the ropes in the oil patch like Chesapeake Energy NYSE CHK and FreeportMcMoRan NYSE FCX led the rally and thats actually a major positive said Cramer The averages reversed losses when the oil prices spiked Oil has dragged down the market for some time since investors feel that demand for crude is declining In Cramers opinion the demand is rising but due to the supply glut prices are going down Investors feel that the debtladen companies will go bust if the oil prices remain low but the fact is that at most might be able to pull off When the dollar becomes weaker oil prices will rise as oil is sold in dollars Finally reality was seen in the markets as stocks of retailers and restaurants went up since they benefit from lower gasoline prices For some time these groups went down along with the crude price which is unusual behavior The selling in financials due to European banks continued and many high growth stocks went down as investors moved into
