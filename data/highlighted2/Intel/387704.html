A Triumph Of Faith Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMD reported a yy revenue decline to million and an operating loss of million AMD offered relatively bullish guidance for Q of a sequential revenue increase The faith of Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD investors has been rewarded by an impressive gain in the stock following AMDs earnings report on Thursday I dont share the faith of AMDs investors and fans as it runs contrary to too many inconvenient facts Although many will point to Mr Market for validation the reaction of the market by no means affects or improves AMDs competitive position AMDs earnings call immediately confronted investors and analysts with management beliefs that convey a tenuous at best grip on reality In her prepared remarks and responses to question CEO Lisa Su referred to her belief that AMD has gained or will continue to gain share in x processors For instance in her prepared remarks she states We reduced our operating loss from the prior quarter outperformed the PC market and believe we regained processor and GPU share If you listen to the audio youll notice how she seems to strain to get the word believe out as if she doesnt quite believe it herself AMD could have substantiated this belief in actual processor shipment data but chose not to The belief is not reconcilable with the known facts In the Computing and Graphics segment AMD reported a yy decline in revenue to million The year over year decrease was explained in AMDs earnings release as driven primarily by decreased sales of client notebook processors AMD also noted a sequential decrease in revenue of relative to Q due to decreased sales of client desktop processors While AMD would offer not specifics for processor unit shipments declines even as percentages <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC was a bit more forthcoming in its Q earnings release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acknowledged that desktop PC unit shipments were down year over year and notebook platform unit shipments were down But these were considerably better results than the PC market as a whole in Q which declined in unit shipments desktop and notebook combined by about according to Gartner and IDC How does one reconcile Sus belief with reality I dont think it can With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>minimizing unit declines relative to the industry as well as growing revenue for the Client Computing Group yy the logical conclusion is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gained market share at AMDs expense This is further supported by the fact that AMD has no compelling products to offer in the x space Its latest announcement of Bristol Ridge as a successor to Carrizo is a perfect example of AMD substituting hype for reality Bristol Ridge cannot justifiably be called a new generation processor compared to Carrizo As Anantech explains its just a very slight update to Carrizo mostly involving a faster memory controller I doubt that any other processor maker in the world would claim that this was a new generation processor on the basis of the minor changes present in Bristol Ridge At least AMD will have no compelling x processors until Zen arrives SA contributor Anchorite confidently predicted that Zen would arrive in Q This belief also appears to be contradicted by the facts About Zen Su stated the following Im also pleased to share that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to reestablish our presence in the datacenter market as we successfully passed several key milestones related to our nextgeneration Zenbased server processor The Zen silicon running in our bringup labs is meeting our expectations and priority customer sampling is on track to begin this quarter in advance of datacenter system availability in The fact that availability will wait until didnt come as a great surprise AMD had until now only been willing to state that production would start late in What came as a surprise is that Zen appears to have completely dropped off the radar as a consumer product Instead Zen has become a data center product with a rumored massive number up to of cores This conveys to me that Zen isnt competitive core for core with current generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Skylake processors as so has had to be repurposed away from direct competition in the consumer space Perhaps this isnt so surprising Zens claim to fame was that the core architecture finally implements dual threading something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has offered for years The claimed performance increase was not going put Zen ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>by any stretch of the imagination In the conference call Su hedged about the exact launch for new Polaris architecture GPUs allowing that there might be some revenue contribution due to Polaris in the June quarter implying a launch ahead of mid year At least in graphics I find the claim of share gains in Q credible and if Polaris does indeed launch in Q I can believe that AMD will achieve further share gains in GPUs during the quarter SA contributor Business Quant has asserted that AMDs claimed graphics advantage over Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA will be maintained into the next generation architectures Specifically Business Quant claims that Pascal wont have hardware support for async computing This seems rather implausible given that the current generation of Nvidia graphics cards already has hardware support for async compute as Ive already pointed out Furthermore the link Business Quant references states up front that this is rumor Reporting rumors as if they were facts is something I try to avoid and this is not a rumor I have much faith in Given the fact that actual hardware is due very soon from both companies Im going to defer further discussion until we have some hard data My expectation remains and this is partly based on Nvidias very impressive Pascal GP processor that Nvidia consumer Pascal GPUs will outperform AMD Polaris At the very least I doubt that AMD is even capable of achieving a decisive advantage over Nvidia What AMD did with Bristol Ridge is indicative of what it will do with Polaris I expect Polaris to be primarily a die shrink to the nm node along with some minor architecture tweaks This is what passes for a new generation at AMD these days AMDs very bullish outlook for Q has probably fueled the spike in the share price AMDs outlook for a sequential gain of in revenue amounts to basically flat yy Nothing to get excited about unless youre an AMD investor Even a sequential revenue gain must seem like manna from heaven As I thought about it I realized that AMDs guidance for Q is probably justified AMDs joint venture to develop server processors with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co Ltd looks good to bring in some much needed cash and the Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics JV should relieve any near term cash flow concerns AMD has reasonable visibility into its semicustom business so its expectations for a revenue boost there appear to be justified I consider expectations of x processor share gains to be entirely specious but AMD may be able to get the drop on Nvidia and roll out Polaris to consumers first But even if everything falls into place in Q I still dont think it makes any difference for AMD in the long run Next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will start shipping its first nm silicon Thats going to reset the bar for AMD all over again putting it even further out of reach Zen is not going to be the savior of AMD in the consumer PC space that AMD fans believe it to be AMD is probably more competitive in GPUs As AMD fans point out asynchronous compute is a good idea that AMD thought of first a few years ago I just doubt that AMD is going to be able to get much more mileage out of that AMD is competing with a better funded profitable rival AMD is an overloaded aging jet with engine trouble barreling down the runway in the hope that it can still take off Its running out of runway Based on the overblown faithbased expectations of AMD investors I now consider AMD an excellent short candidate I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am
