<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>into the worlds top chipmaker and helped usher in the personal computer age died on Tuesday at age <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said The company did not describe the circumstances of his death but Grove who endured the Nazi occupation of Hungary during World War Two living under a fake name and came to the United States to escape the chaos of Soviet rule had suffered from Parkinsons Grove was Intels first hire after it was founded in and became the practicalminded member of a triumvirate that eventually led <span

bestselling management book Grove championed an innovative environment within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>that became a blueprint for successful California startups Grove who was named man of the year by Time magazine in encouraged disagreement and insisted employees be vigilant of disruptions in industry and technology that could be major dangers or opportunities for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>In doing so he could be mercurial and demanding with employees who he thought were not doing enough and in required the staff to work two extra hours a day with no extra pay Groves overhaul of Intels business switching from digital memory to processors was an early example of his obsession with detecting major shifts in business and technology and staying flexible enough to move quickly and make the most of them Its not that you shouldnt plan but you should not regard your plans to be anything more than a baseline model of what might happen Grove said While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore proposed much of the chip technology that helped created the semiconductor industry Grove was the stickler for detail who turned their ideas into actual products He was responsible for driving growth in Intels profits and stock price through the s and s Grove who was Jewish was born Andras Grof in Budapest in Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in his youth and after the Soviets followed Grove sneaked into Austria in and then emigrated to the United States where he learned English and earned a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley Grove went to work in at Fairchild Semiconductor where he researched technology that would eventually be used to make microchips At Fairchild he also met chip visionaries Noyce and Moore who left to found <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in Grove quickly joined them running research and manufacturing He became Intels president in CEO in and chairman and CEO in He gave up his CEO title in and stayed on as chairman until In its early years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>focused on making DRAM memory chips When Japanese competition soared Grove made the fateful decision to reinvent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>as a manufacturer of microprocessors the brains at the center of personal computers and other electronic devices As the personal computer industry took off in the s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>supplied its processors to IBM and then to Compaq and other manufacturers making IBM clone PCs Intels chips along with Microsofts Windows operating system quickly became an industry standard in the exploding PC industry with Grove funneling profits into research and development to create faster and faster processors Under his stewardship the Pentium brand and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Inside logo became widely recognized by consumers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains one of the worlds leading semiconductor companies but the PC chipmaker is wrestling to adapt to trends toward smaller gadgets like smartphones and tablets Grove also was a champion of keeping manufacturing within the United States arguing outsourcing the manufacturing of electronics products like batteries or televisions meant US companies missed out on gaining experience necessary to make technology breakthroughs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still makes most of its chips in US plants During his time at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the s Grove was treated for prostate cancer and later wrote an influential cover story in Fortune magazine criticizing the medical establishments treatment of the disease as inefficient compared to scientific standards applied in semiconductor research In later life Grove donated tens of millions of dollars for research on Parkinsons disease a condition he suffered from He also regularly criticized government and medical researchers for making slow and inefficient progress beating that disease compared to accomplishments made in the chip industry Grove and his wife Eva who married a year after meeting while working at
