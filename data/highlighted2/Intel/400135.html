failure so far in mobile despite spending billion developing chips for that market and based his extinction argument on that combined with Intels declining PC business and tough competition in data

in the event of an asteroid strike over the next several months say news refuting the rumors about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>getting a piece of the iPhone well show a couple of ways doing that via hedging If youd like a refresher on hedging terms first please see the section titled Refresher On Hedging Terms in our recent article on hedging Apple Hedging Apple Ahead Of Earnings Well use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge INTC here but you dont need the app to do that You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the math Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process in that article or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for optimal puts is your threshold which is the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of If you are more risk averse you could use a smaller threshold And if you are less risk averse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Wednesdays close to hedge shares of INTC against a greater than drop by late October As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A few points about this cost To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the put In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your INTC position would be down not including the hedging cost The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts so they may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines significantly in the near term when the puts may still have significant time value When searching for an optimal collar youll need one more figure in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a sixmonth period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap You dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that We checked Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of INTCs potential return over the next several months Every trading day the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the US and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return One of those screens looks at price performance over the last six months and based on that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>didnt pass so the site didnt calculate a potential return for it So instead we derived a potential return from the median Wall Street price target for the stock screen captured from Yahoo Finance below That median price target of represents a potential return over the next months from Intels May th closing price of which implies a potential return of about over the time frame of our hedge So we used as a cap As of Wednesdays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of INTC against a greater than drop by late October while not capping an investors upside at less than by the end of that time period As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was a bit higher or of position value So the net cost was negative meaning an investor opening this collar would have collected an amount equal to or of position value A few notes on this hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal puts to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar Although the threshold takes into account positive hedging cost as we noted above it doesnt take into account negative hedging cost So taking into account negative hedging cost of the worstcase scenario for the investor hedged with this collar would be a drawdown of As with the optimal puts above this hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security plummets in the near future due to the put legs combination of intrinsic value and time value for an example of this see the section titled More Protection Than Promised in this article However if the underlying security spikes in the near future the combined time value and intrinsic value of the call leg can have the opposite effect making it costly to exit the position early for an extreme example of this
