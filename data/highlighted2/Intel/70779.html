Altera is not earth shaking Its deal with China and willingness to listen could be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC has long been one of the most popular stocks to boost here at Seeking Alpha Its potential acquisition of Altera NASDAQ ALTR has the boosters going allout You should buy the company after the deal After all its not going to threaten the dividend The growth story is not over I had been bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for some time but my view has become far more constructive since Krzanich and President Renee James took over The last time I focused on it a month ago I even recommended it for conservative portfolios Intels problems have laid in mobility an insular corporate culture and the fact that it is the only company today that both designs its own microprocessors and manufactures them The foundry and design businesses today are very very different Moores Second Law under which chips get exponentially more expensive to produce as their complexity grows has made chip plants ferociously expensive to the point where there are now only three competitors Design has moved from the general to the specific with chips now created for specific applications or specific products rather than in the general way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has preferred to make them As a result Krzanich is having to buy growth and Altera is an example of that If the New York Post report is accurate Krzanich is willing to pay billion about times earnings for a company that had sales of billion last year and will struggle to reach that level this time It has attractive margins bringing million of the million it brought in during the first quarter to the net income line and it has customers in mobile markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>badly wants to serve The numbers wont provide a big boost to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>which had sales of billion last year and net income of billion per share on which it paid cents in dividends What the deal mainly reflects is a new direction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>absorbing a designoriented corporate culture Of far more interest to me is last falls billion investment in Chinas Tsinghua Unigroup last fall under which it gets of companies like Spreadtrum and a coveted spot under Chinas government for building that nations own semiconductor infrastructure Spreadtrum CEO Leo Li was profiled at EE Times this week basically lecturing the company saying he would pick and choose which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>technology to use and they cant force us to abandon the ARM NASDAQ ARMH designs it has used in the past Li is more interested in Intels foundry business the move from nanometer manufacture to nm which he will start using next year Its an attitude which expressed in public which would have infuriated Andy Groves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>But Krzanich takes it on treating Spreadtrum and China as equal business partners And its this attitude that offers hope for Intels future Not because China knows more about making chips its trying to learn Intels foundry technology not the other way around Its because China does know how the OEM business works how to drive chips from the design bench into real products and this secret sauce is what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>desperately needs to power growth Thats why I continue to call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>interesting Its for a conservative portfolio not one focused exclusively on growth Why is it shorted so avidly Because like many other popular shorts it provides protection against sudden negative market moves like the one that might happen today with Chinas own stock market tanking Its crash insurance Source Why Krzanichs <span
