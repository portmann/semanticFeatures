ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation INTC by Doug Young Bottom line Intels latest drive to fund wirelessrelated Chinese startups is part of a growing strategy to promote its struggling telecoms chip business but it could face big obstacles due to Chinas lackluster record at innovation I have to commend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC for its perseverance in the telecoms space with news that the fading microchip giant is adding an incubator initiative to its drive into the sector using China as a backdoor But that said this latest project looks pathetically small with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>earmarking a meager million yuan or less than million to the initiative This project is just one of several recent initiatives for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in China and we should point out that many of the companies its targeting would probably be happy for just million or less to fund their early development But that said this particular initiative looks mostly like a public relations ploy than anything really substantive and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might be advised to get a little more aggressive if its serious about promoting a Chinabased ecosystem for its struggling telecoms chip business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was one of the earliest major chip makers to enter China and has held its regular developer forums in the country for more than a decade now It announced this new incubator initiative at its latest developer forum taking place in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen It said it will allot the million yuan to its first Mass Makerspace Accelerator program aimed at funding startups that can help to popularize its chips especially ones in the telecoms space Chinese article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also announced the launch of an million yuan angel investment fund specifically for China adding another modest sum to the pot of money it is earmarking for startup companies News reports are pointing out the million yuan program is a firstofitskind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and the location for the initiative highlights the companys strategy of using China to play catchup to technology from rival ARM that now dominates the wireless chip space Im not familiar enough with the differences in technology to comment on the IntelARM rivalry but its certainly clear that few design houses have decided to use Intels technology to date for their wireless chips <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has launched a couple of major new investments in China to try and change that hoping to woo local developers and also central leaders in Beijing to its products One of those came last September when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>invested billion for percent of a telecoms chip maker being assembled by Beijingbased Tsinghua Unigroup through the consolidation of a couple of leading Chinese design houses In December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>followed that move by announcing another billion upgrade for its chipmaking plant in the interior city of Chengdu which was initially built about a decade ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>certainly seems to be placing its China bets in many places both geographically and strategically The Tsinghua Unigroup investment involves chip design at a relatively mature company based in Beijing the Chengdu plan involves chip manufacturing in Chengdu one of Chinas largest interior cities and a priority for development by Beijing and now this latest initiative is aimed at startup company development centered in Shenzhen a boomtown near Hong Kong that has become a hightech hub I have to commend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for its multitiered China approach and expect we could see or more major initiatives in the year ahead perhaps similar in scale to the Unigroup and Chengdu projects At the end of the day China is certainly an important center for the manufacture of wireless devices though it has yet to emerge as a strong base for chip design and manufacturing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>wants to help China make that transition and boost its own prospects though its late arrival to the space and Chinas lackluster record at innovation could be big obstacles in that drive Source
