first to start Id like to welcome everyone this afternoon to the presentation with Micron Technology Its my pleasure to introduce to my immediate left Ernie Maddock who is the Chief Financial Officer of Micron Weve got a fireside chat format here this afternoon Ill kick things off with some questions but if you have any questions weve got a mic circulating so please raise your hand and well get to you And I think Ernie with that we had dinner last night with a group of investors and I think one of the key questions that was asked is help us understand all the pieces on the memory chessboard right now Youve got the Chinese youve got <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with Dalian youve got ShinHwa youve got Feng Tao ph It seems like there is a lot of pieces on the memory chessboard that are moving right now I think a lot of investors are trying to understand what the Micron strategy is in lieu of all this movement So the way I would characterize the strategy is we want to continue to ensure market access in China and we also want to continue to ensure access to capital markets and if we have both of those things then that would really inform the specific actions that we were taking as we talked a lot about last night You can get into a different scenarios what if this happens and that happens and I think you can get wrapped up in this or you can step back and say listen the Company has survived in the industry that has been very dynamic since its inception And so its not reasonable to think that somehow a Company that learned how to survive and prosper in the midst of that would somehow loose that muscle memory in the circumstances where in fact you have maybe a slightly different chessboard maybe its a little more difficult to understand But listen its not as if our competitors hand us a playbook everyday of what their plans are and their technology roadmaps are and somehow we take that playbook and capitalize on it The situation particularly with respect to China is not so different than the environment the Company has been operating in for some time So while I acknowledge there is a lot of moving pieces and a lot of things in the news at the end of the day its really important to separate what youre reading from what reality is and if youre reading something that causes you to scratch your head then read a little deeper and understand a little deeper and youll begin to understand a lot of this is about positioning and trying to create a perspective on an ability or a desire that may not necessarily be backed up fully with the capability Youve been around for a while I think one of the concerns that investors have is historically whenever there has been a new sovereign entrance into the semiconductor business it tends to be great for your old job on the equipment side of it and not so good for the memory players and whether that was Japan in the s Korea in the s Taiwan Whats different now about the memory industry that makes a new sovereign entrant less of a threat or less viable within the memory market With that historical perspective I think the thing thats a little bit different is a recognition that without the complete access to the IP the knowhow the capability the prognosis for success is pretty low And I think that it may have taken a while for anyone to learn that but if you look at each one of the examples you specified at the end of the day they lacked one of those things that although they may have made a splash it eventually led to an unhappy outcome And certainly a lot of what you read in the press suggests that there has been learning associated with that which is why the approach is quite different This isnt about building a fab and creating employment this is about having knowledge and access to IP and that IP is actually fairly closely held different players in DRAM versus NAND but that IP is actually fairly closely held and although it is not impossible to create it from scratch the road is a very bumpy one and certainly experience would suggest that that may not be the path you chose to take Another change late in the memory market has been Intels Dalian announcement billion in CapEx next year billion over the life of that fab If you go back it was in six years ago where they were restructuring their business and giving you more capacity to try to minimize the impact of NAND on their financials and now they seem to be moving in an opposite direction Its a little odd of us to kind of question just how strong is the relationship between Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and the JV Give us your perspective Our perspective is the partnership is still quite strong I think its important to remember that the IP thats developed within the partnership can be used by the either partner for their own means and their own end and certainly we dont question Intels decision to provide some captive capacity for NAND I think their public comments and investment levels sort of suggests in fact that its very consistent with the idea that they view memory as strategically important so there has been no surprises there for us It should not be construed that the partnership is in some way shape or form jeopardized still a great partner We continue to coinvest with them on new technology and so we really view this as a very ordinary course of events Micron expanded its capability with fab in Singapore and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is doing things that it feels are in the best interest of their needs and I dont think anybody should construe this that the partnership is somewhat weakened or that were going our separate ways Ernie as Dalian ramps how much of your capacity for NAND do you think youll be providing to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>versus today and to the extent that its less where can you repurpose that NAND capacity and will we actually be able to repurpose it at higher margin I think thats possibilities is just we dont ever disclose specifically how much were supplying but we did release information relating to the new supply agreements probably now or months ago but certainly we have an ambition to enter end markets that we think absolutely have the potentials for allowing us some gross margin expansion there The relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>helps us mitigate the risk of our fab expansion and we think actually the transition has the potential to be quite orderly as our ability to address end markets ramps up maybe there ability to supply and their own account from Dalian mitigate some of the demand from our side So again we werent surprised we feel this is sort of part of the ordinary course of business Most of the questions last time had been were focused on NAND and clearly if you go out over the next to years thats probably a bigger growth driver than DRAM I think weve got about into a hour diner before the first DRAM question came out I am going to start with DRAM its still the vast majority of your revenue and if you look over the next to years probably one of the bigger driver of financials at least in the near term Talk to us a little bit about the nanometer transition how is that going how should we think that unfolds over the next several quarters Right so weve talked about the fact that sort of by the middle of next year its going to represent more than a majority of our DRAM capability The ramp is going quite well and Inotera is certainly effectively making that transition and were continuing with CapEx investments that we have planned for fiscal to fully get that capability in place as well as planned for the next generation So that transition in addition to the renegotiation of the Inotera agreement that weve talked about which will have beneficial impact to the Companys margin structure as we get into the middle of calendar both of those things should give us some nice tailwinds in the business as we look at the year unfolding One of the interesting things about the DRAM dynamic last quarter for you is that you were somewhat insulated from market trends I know some that of that is due to the fact that PC DRAM is now what of the business so you got to good mix Can you just talk about the mix of DRAM and the profitability of those mixes and how that might be insulating you from current pricing dynamics in the market Sure we dont disclose segment profitability but I think its fair to say that as long as the PC market looks the way it looks were going to continue to look elsewhere for profitable outlets for our DRAM capacity And in some cases those markets may provide gross margin opportunities greater than and in some cases they might be equal and in extreme they might be slightly less however we feel they represent longer term opportunities So it really is sort of a full menu of results and options for us But netnet the company continues to look for ways to maximize its strategic positioning even if that means in the shortterm that we may suboptimize profitability for a quarter so while we make that happen The other significant then in your DRAM business as you get into the new calendar year is the renegotiation of the Inotera agreement I think a lot of investors because that agreement is somewhat opaque for obvious reasons to us at least are trying to understand how current market pricing might impact the benefit of the renegotiation of the Inotera contract So help us understand what kind of margin upside you think Micron will get at current market prices and how that will sort of differ relative to what the market does overall Sure so I think the way I would characterize it and have characterized it is over any reasonable set of expectations on pricing its fair to think that on the Inotera portion of the output its an upper single digit benefit in the aggregate DRAM business probably somewhere in the low to midsingle digits and unless you presume a pretty apocalyptic environment relative to pricing that general rule still holds Switching over to the NAND side of the business and this is going through a transition to D If you look at your planar business you were always somewhat subscale you were always somewhat the high cost producer how do you see sort of relative cost as the world transitions to D and you guys are clearly taking you and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>combined together are taking a different architectural approach going with floating gate versus charge trap how should we as investors think about the impact to your relative cost by making that architectural shift Certainly as we transition to our first generation of D this is not a particularly easy transition Its going well dont mean to cause concern by that comment But if you look at the net cost reduction the aggregate rule of thumb is youd see somewhere around half of the bit output increase conversely applied to pricing So as soon as we sort of get through the initial transitions in the ramp I think that that map still holds and I think for us there is particular benefit as we move into the second generation of D which is coming not too far behind our first implementation of D We will probably get incrementally more benefit on that second generation than we do on the first But we would still expect to see a meaningful cost reduction as we transition to the first generation Do you think you will be the low cost producer should we think about it more in terms of the gap today is going to close significantly as you move to D I think the latter is probably better We are not in a position to say we believe we are going to be the cost leader But certainly we are going to be in the same lap of the racetrack with the cost leader if not the cost leader And so we are very comfortable with how we will be positioned as we move forward into the D realm And then last night on the demand side We spent a lot of time talking about SSDs and the growth in the SSD market I wonder if you can talk a little bit about sort of the controller technology because clearly thats going to be a critical part of the value that you will be able to extract in an SSD solution And I think for a lot of this us its difficult to judge everyone says their controller technology is great Whats your take on kind of your competitive positioning on controller technology for SSDs Its one of the three strategic priorities for the company the other two being the transition to nanometer DRAM in next generation and the second being the transition to D NAND and preparatory work for the subsequent generation We recently announced the acquisition of Tidal Systems which we feel provides a fantastic foundation around which to continue to develop our controller architecture So we are comfortable relative to all the pieces that will need to be in place to meaningful enter the SSD market that between the NAND technology and the controller capability we see that all coming together to allow us to be competitive in that space how we talk about it absolutely relative to the capability of others is always a challenging feat Does your ability to get into the enterprise market change with the recent acquisition announced by Western Digital or help me understand how that acquisition impacts your competitive positioning if at all Depending on what scenario you want to play out there right arguably nothing has changed and you can make a case where you say wow everything has changed At the end of the day Western Digital plays in that space will continue to play in that space and they now have access to a supplier of NAND arguably at cost and theyve traded off paying for the unit cost with a gee I bought a company and pay the significant premium for it So we dont see that in and of itself as changing the landscape If you want to get into game theory and suggest that there is going to be rapid proliferation of NAND output as a result of that transaction then everything gets worst for everyone right because when you have supply exceeding demand we all know what the impact of that is but we wouldnt we dont foresee that at least as we understand the environment now Do you guys anticipate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>maybe having different motivations with their memory business and maybe everyone else in memory does ie if they see a path to selling more processors selling higher end processors and FPGAs with Altera arent they somewhat incented on money levels to really kill the overall cost of memory in a system I mean I could see it being very bad for Western Digitals hard drive business I could see it being bad for the memory guys because they will trade off margin there for profit dollars in their core business Why isnt that a reasonable risk as we kind of go forward over the next couple of years Its impossible to say that it isnt but by the same token right theyd actually be destroying the value of the IP that theyve created and they would essentially be devaluating the investments that they are making and plan to make So it feels very different when you actually have significant skin in the game which with the investment they have made at Dalian they will Nonetheless that may still be ultimately what they chose to do but those are questions better addressed to them rather than to us With respect to D XPoint I am curious about how you envision approaching the market My guess is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will try and do something with respect to their processors and integrating there Is your view that you would maybe sum up how you view approach the market with that We havent really talked about that because were still in the process of actually working our way through that So I think as we exit this year I think youd expect to see us become a little more clear about those plans but for the moment were in the formulation process of that and havent talked much about that publicly Ernie can you give a rehash of the current situation with Lehi between you and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in terms of the put option that you have as well as what they have and how that may have factored into Intels thought on investing Dalian fab Well I can certainly comment on the facts of the case Again I cant describe how that might have impacted Intels motivation those are questions best addressed to them But essentially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has the right to put and Micron has the right to call the capacity associated with that fab That does not impact the RD JV and its sort of unreasonable to think that even though we possess that capability that we would chose to do that within the context of the partnership as it exists today which is healthy and thriving So both options exists and I cant really speak to how that may have influenced Intels decision to expand capacity in China Ernie one question on China your two major memory competitors have fabs in China Micron does not Is there something you could do there locally firstly or are you thinking about that And secondly could you do something like a Inotera relationship on the NAND side with a Chinese company that could do like almost like a contract manufacturing for you Is that something that is allowed in your relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or does that require replaying from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>So firstly with respect to the fact that Micron has no fab presence in China that is true however we have a pretty significant backend presence in China And thus far at least again if you go back to the fairly simple perspective that we want to do the things necessary to continue to ensure market access having a fab in China has not seemed to provide advantages to folks who do relative to that market access and certainly with our announcement of the fab expansion in Singapore relatively to NAND we have pretty much cast our bets relative to NAND capacity for at least the next few years Relative to whether it would be possible to do an Inotera like arrangement again if it involves the transfer of IP then it would require Intels agreement and Intels consent I am not so completely familiar with the JV to understand that if we were allowing someone to use the IP solely on our behalf whether or not that would require their permission my suspicion is it likely would be And again given the sensitivity around having access to IP there and what the likely outcome is it would be a really long contemplated decision on our part Ernie clearly the memory market is different than its historically been albeit its still cyclical given the earnings trajectory youve had over the last months Can you help us understand as you sit here today when you look at your competitors and the CapEx budgets for next year How worried should we be about oversupply both in the DRAM market and the NAND market I think there is two very different dynamics going on in DRAM versus NAND So I guess if you could answer the question on both fronts Id appreciate it Sure so if you look at the DRAM front based upon what weve talked about and the public announcement of our competitors it feels very much like folks are focused on technology transition that has a relatively predictable outcome in terms of bit supplied and as we look at bits demanded which we think for DRAM next year are kind of in the mids it doesnt appear as if there is going to be a significant imbalance there Its not as if there are going to be high s bit supplied and mids bits demanded we would think it sort of the high end of what folks have talked about youd see mids bit supplied at the lower end with more modest CapEx budget should probably see lower s So that feels as if its in relative balance on the NAND side we think the story is a little bit different we think bit demand is going to grow somewhere in the mids and if you look at bit supply it feels as if that is also imbalanced based on everything that weve talked about and in the public commentary of others thats not to say that there will be perfect symmetry over the course of the year in our case weve talked about the fact our bits supply would be predominantly oriented more to the back half rather than the front half I know there has been several questions asked about boy are we going to see an expansion of bits supply in DRAM into a seasonally weak period but again as it relates to Micron more of our bits supply is going to be coming online towards the end of the year So based on everything that we know and understand we dont foresee there to be significant imbalances on either front albeit you may see quarterly a little quarterly irregularities but thats easily managed On the NAND demand front at least for next year how important is the smartphone market And the reason why I ask is the largest consumer of NAND in the world is Apple and theyre coming off two fiscal years of very strong unit ph growth of over This year that was also positively impacted by content growth I mean you could paint a scenario where Apple is more flattish next year than up and so when you think about that plus demand environment for NAND next year whats baked in there handset market versus other things like SSDs really starting to accelerate So we would look at mobile which is bigger than just handset and say on a unit count basis fairly flat but on a constant basis there is room for significant growth right So somewhere around the to content growth handsets in particular we do not have a very aggressive view of unit expansion however you know content particularly on low end smartphones still has a lot of upside in it Great with that I think weve ended our session in this room Ernie I wants to thank you for your time this afternoon as well as everyone who joined us Ernie
