major product line in two years D NAND is more important for the immediate future A couple of weeks ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU treated us to a joint introduction of a new memory technology called D Cross Point memory The new memory is to be built in the IMFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Micron Flash Technologies fab in Lehi Utah The memory is being promoted as a big deal Microns CEO Mark Durcan feels that DXP a new acronym will be a major product category for Micron by He specifically mentioned that it would be half the size of Microns DRAM business That would make it onethird of total Micron sales or about billion by that time There is a lot of speculation on what DXP is where it fits and how much it should cost etc So its probably time to take a look at computing memory hierarchy and try to make some sense out of all this Allow me to insert this before I begin In the early days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was formed as a memory company to make SRAM Static Random Access Memory and DRAM Dynamic Random Access Memory The companys strategy was to use microprocessors as the leverage product to obtain a customers memory business Hold that thought A computer system uses different kinds of memory for different things At the top of the hierarchy is SRAM used as very highspeed cache memory The story of cache memory is that a statistically small number of pieces of data and instructions make up the majority of use in a computer So rather than stuff this data a long ways away the computer sticks it in the nearby fast cache memory where it can be retrieved quickly and reused thus increasing overall performance of the system SRAM cache memory started out on the mother board of early computers and was supplied by third party memory manufacturers such as Cypress Semiconductor NASDAQ CY and Integrated Device Technology NASDAQ IDTI As systems become more complex <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>began making the SRAM chips first mounted on the mother board and then mounted near the CPU chip inside the CPU package Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>integrated the SRAM cache onto the CPU chip Does this begin to shed some light on the importance of having memory near the compute element SRAM cache has grown to the point that it makes up over half the area of the CPU chip The bit size of the cache is small MB range so this small memory size costs the computer buyer over by far the costliest memory per bit in the overall hierarchy Cache is extremely fast nonvolatile large six transistor cell and expensive At this point in time you can consider that SRAM cache bits are half of Intels CPU sales or about billion Who would have thought that Next in the hierarchy is DRAM DRAM is fast much cheaper than SRAM volatile and klutzy to use but it has infinite endurance and has been the prime technology used for computer main memory for the past years Its interesting to note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is building in their fabs an embedded DRAM chip for the higher end client CPU chips MB That is the first footprint in the sand on the way to grabbing the client DRAM business maybe using DXP to do it Finally we come up with storage memory The prime characteristics of storage are that it be nonvolatile and cheap HDDs Hard Disc Drive have served this purpose for decades Recently the benefits of NANDbased SSDs Solid State Drive have driven their adoption in both enterprise and client systems This trend will continue until full adoption of SSDs is achieved in an estimated billion market So there we have it Oops I left DXP out There must be a place for it isnt there Just teasing Of course there is a place for it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron refer to DXP as Storage Class Memory SCM so if it is going to be used as storage it better be nonvolatile which it is Also it better be cheap and we think its sort of cheap If memory system memory is distinct from storage DXP should be fast and must be random access if its to be used as system memory and it is So the logical first case use will be between DRAM and storage NAND at a price thats lower that DRAM but higher than NAND based SSDs Some DRAM will be needed since the DXP technology does not have infinite endurance Remember the embedded DRAM I mentioned above So lets look at the relative price example if a NAND bit costs penny then a DRAM bit would cost pennies of the technologies Im going to turn the order upside down for my convenience Things get more fuzzy from here The above representation for a typical client computer with a GB SSD GB of DRAM and much less than a GB of SRAM The first use case is likely to be in data centers where the attributes of DXP will be much more valuable and the cost of SSD storage is much higher due to very stringent requirements The big difference above comes in the price of SSD between client and server Im using per GB for server SSDs Remember the thought to hold from above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was right microprocessors do leverage the memory business In this case the SRAM business No one even thinks about it since its integrated into the fabric of the processor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>owns the SRAM business lock stock and barrel In a few years the same will be said about FPGAs integrated onto XEON chips The computing business is a memory business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the memory business with both feet in all technologies They only left the DRAM business for a while The server memory business is potentially a billion business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and the way they will bring that home is with SSDs that have a mix of DXP and D NAND Nobody will be able to compete with that kind of a product I think that DXP will find a home in client and mobile as well because it will give power benefits out of proportion to its cost While Micron is involved the prime benefits accrue to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>since they have the adjacent businesses to leverage and bury the memory business to the exclusion of all comers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the more powerful buy here Next cost price and margins for DXP and D NAND Disclosure I amwe are long INTC MoreI wrote this article
