It Time For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>To Spin Off The Fabs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Fabrication technology is much less important than it was in the past Having to keep fabs busy and to finance the RD for newer processes sometimes forces <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to make aggressive moves that hurt stockholder value For decades the crown jewels of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC were its fabrication technology plants Clearly things have changed for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and the industry as a whole to the point where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should reexamine whether having its own fabs continues to give its shareholders the best return If we look at the turn of the century we can see node advances offered advantages considerable greater than today Going to the around the turn of the century a new node promised in excess of improvement in clock speed with transistors costing roughly half as much while using less power For example the Pentium III Katmai nm used watts at MHz the Coppermine nm version at the same clock speed used watts Or it could reach GHz at watts Its successor the Tualatin nm officially reached GHz while using only watts It could actually hit GHz easily but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>did not wish for it to be too attractive compared to the Pentium Nowadays the cost per wafer is going up nearly according to Intels Bill Holt in the November investors meeting whereas recent previous node changes were closer to The move from nm to nm did not improve topend performance the nm Sandy Bridge remains the best overclocking processor The power parameters did improve at lower clock speeds however The nm node did bring the cost per transistor down significantly even with the wafer cost going up faster than prior nodes if you believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Power use does not seem to be improved significantly while performance is equal or slightly down All in all its not an enormous step forward despite being significantly delayed Worse still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>announced another delay to the nm node which will leave it two quarters behind both TSMC and Samsung if all perform according to their latest statements With Intels competitors currently producing FinFets the advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had until very recently is essentially gone Its not clear which process has the performance edge or better power use parameters but given the relatively poor characteristics of Intels nm chips in power and performance improvement and the greatly improved power characteristics of Samsungs new nm Exynos processor the gap has been greatly diminished if not closed One of the issues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>faces is because of its shrinking size the ability to compete with companies like Samsung OTCSSNLF and TSMC NYSE TSM will likely get more difficult considering their growth TSMC will pass <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is CapEX for which is a first and recently showed a huge uptick in July sales being up year to year and quarter to quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to shrink in comparison Both Samsung and TSMC have announced nm parts will be in volume production in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>by contrast has delayed its nm volume production to Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced its nodes will now take roughly months TSMCs nm node will be qualifying in Q only five quarters behind the nm node Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generally creates one process per node TSMC creates several each having differing characteristics allowing products in different segments to use the process most appropriate for it Already with FF just ramping TSMC is working on a FFC process which will be a low cost low power process well suited for IoT devices Widely disparate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>devices from Xeon servers to Quark processors all use the same process or will despite having widely varying characteristics During the times that Intels processes were far in advance of competitors this was not nearly as problematic as it is now And it will only get worse as TSMC habitually continues to create new processes on the same node very recently the company released a new nm node While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>can use better suited processes from competitors the real issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is financing the enormous costs of continued research and development and updating fabrication plants With these costs escalating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must try to grow revenue sometimes leading to desperate attempts that compromise the earnings of the company The most recent related to Intels pricing of the Atom line of processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could not lower the price of server processors as that market is not very price sensitive or the mainstream line as that is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has to gain the profits to afford the massive losses of the contrarevenue program Instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>tried to create demand in the lowend segment Most people know that Intels MCG group lost billion in after losing over billion in with projections of billion in This is mainly related to the tablet market but we also have to consider that AMD walked away from a lot of business because Intels pricing was so low in the PC market Clearly with the cost of wafers going up by Intels account processor sizes will decrease as the PC market clearly would not react well to a significant price increase given how fragile it already is Also outside of GPUs the benefit of increasing size is not in proportion with the costs As such with overall smaller processors and Intels struggling grow the difficulty of fully utilizing fabs will become even more difficult <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is clearly unable to attract customers for its fabs and was unable to even with a large process lead Part of this is distrust of the company mixed with antipathy Much of it is also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not well prepared to be a foundry for external customers As long as these fabs are part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>it become less likely for major customers to consider it as an option as Intels behavior when ascendant is wellknown and undesirable its clearly better for manufacturers to have competitive pureplay foundries I think it is much more that companies like Apple would take a much closer look at Intels fabs if they werent Intels fabs And naturally as a separate entity culture changes which promoted more efficient research while at the same time emphasizing greater development tools for potential customers would further create a more attractive environment One point many people will be concerned about is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>no longer having control over the process and development thus having negative implications on the performance of the product This is not so as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could pay for custom nodes or even retain development of processes but not actually possessing the fabs to build them which is essentially what IBM NYSE IBM did Furthermore given the volume of Intels business fabs would be competing aggressive to win its business and would be very inclined to work with the company A decade ago the thought of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>or even AMD NASDAQ AMD selling their fabrication facilities seemed very misguided to me AMDs founder Jerry Sanders would say Real men have fabs and for a long time that was true In the current situation however its clear AMD was better off selling its fabs while the balance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is shifting more to this as well This is not a prediction that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management will do so in the near future as this group is reactionary if nothing else As long as the company is highly profitable the strong traditional attachment to the fabs will make a split very unlikely However if management changes or if competition from AMD actually exists when Zen is introduced or both the company will likely examine this very closely Editors Note This article discusses one or more
