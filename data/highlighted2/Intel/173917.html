class='textDiv'>Theoretical <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>And Micron Merger The Window Of Opportunity Is Closing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha By the bulk of Microns revenue will come from technologies that it is jointly developing and manufacturing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Microns absurdly low valuation the lack of antitrust concerns over D NAND and XPoint market and the ideal antiChina political environment have created a fantastic opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to acquire Micron This potential merger is probably just wild speculation on my part that is not backed up with a significant amount of evidence On paper an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU merger makes a lot of sense Through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microns IMFT joint venture the two developed D NAND and D XPoint These nonvolatile memories have the potential to thrust these two semiconductor giants from laggards of the memory industry to the clear engineering leaders With D NAND and D XPoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron could have something special In a previous Seeking Alpha article I speculated that Microns D XPoint could find a home in IMDB By pairing DRAM with XPoint in a package the endurance limitations of XPoint could be significantly mitigated and the overall cost of memory for IMDB could be reduced significantly Russ Fischer of Seeking Alpha consistently seems to be overly bullish or bearish in his semiconductor positions from my perspective One thing he always does though is make me think and reevaluate which I believe is the goal of writing on this site He posted an article in August on this site that suggested an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU could be combined with GB of DRAM and GB of XPoint in a single package using EMIB To put it in nontechnical terms there are significant potential synergies with packaging some combination of DRAM D XPoint and D NAND and an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPU By my aggressive estimates the bulk of Microns revenue in and beyond will come from technologies that it is jointly developing and manufacturing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>These technologies are D NAND and D XPoint and potentially another yet to be announced nonvolatile memory I also believe there is a reasonably good chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microns implementation of D NAND will give the duo the industrys highest bit density NAND that will scale well and allow the two partners to maintain a cost advantage over Samsung OTCSSNLF SK Hynix OTCHXSCF and SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK for many years to come It also seems highly likely that Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with XPoint are currently significantly ahead of Samsung and SK Hynix in developing a nextgeneration nonvolatile memory While the two companies are highly cooperative partners they are still currently competitors If D NAND and XPoint become as important and successful as I expect they will be by the odds of a DOJ Department of Justice andor FTC Federal Trade Commission intervention in a potential merger between the two semiconductor leaders will likely be significantly higher in the future than they are now when these two technologies produce essentially no revenue for either firm Micron and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could be successful in the future as separate entities However being partners in the design and manufacturing of D NAND and XPoint while at the same time potentially being adversaries in selling these products creates an uncomfortable dynamic Toshiba OTCPKTOSBF and SanDisk have proven it is possible to succeed with this sort of relationship but ultimately it just makes so much more sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron to merge and create a single semiconductor giant This new semiconductor company created by the merger could significantly increase its power and technological advantage over the industry By controlling the entire worlds supply of XPoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would prevent competitors from getting their hands on this cost efficient nonvolatile memory and create a package containing a CPU DRAM and XPoint of their own If Micron and Intels D NAND is able to take the cost per bit leadership as I expect in and maintain this lead for the foreseeable future the two would only serve as competitors against each other on price unless they are able to agree not to compete against each other in certain markets As a single entity they would be able to maximize their gross margins that they have earned from their superior NAND architecture I will present my crazy conspiracy theory now I believe it is possible that Tsinghua Unigroup which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a stake in made a bid for Micron at a price that the Chinese company realized had no chance of being accepted by Micron at the behest of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The main purpose of this bid may have been to stir the political fear machine that wants people to believe China is evil and a takeover of Micron by a Chinese company would be a huge risk to national security Senators Chuck Schumer and John McCain have publicly raised their concerns about Tsinghua Unigroups unsolicited bid With the US government fearing a potential Chinese acquisition of a strategically important company to the nation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>making a bid for Micron will seem like a white knight has come to save Micron from the hands of the enemy What a noble gesture it would be for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to acquire Micron for the greater good Sarcasm intended in the previous sentence When two companies that are as large and as important as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron are trying to merge it is difficult to predict how the DOJ and FTC will act Government agencies are not always rational A merger of the two a few months ago may have sparked at least mild protest from both the DOJ and FTC Congress and other members of the government may now urge regulators to look the other way and allow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Micron to merge to prevent the unacceptable possibility of a takeover from a Chinese company With the current low valuation Micron is receiving in the market it would be an opportunistic time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to make an acquisition offer with a large premium in excess of to the current share Micron is trading at now While I strongly believe that Micron is worth well over double its current price theres a good chance Microns shareholders would jump at the opportunity to seize immediate sizable gains Of course Intels pending acquisition of Altera NASDAQ ALTR adds a wrinkle to the timing equation of this theoretical deal It is extremely unlikely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would attempt an acquisition of Micron until the Altera deal is complete I believe the window for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acquisition of Micron could close over the next months as the perfect storm of a low price on Microns shares the lack of antitrust concerns over D NAND and XPoint and the ideal political environment for this deal are unlikely to last indefinitely With or without an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>acquisition I believe Micron presents compelling value to longterm shareholders at this price level Intels shareholders probably wont be crying either if a deal happens Disclosure I amwe are long MU MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I
