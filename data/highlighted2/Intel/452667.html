To Check An Income Statement And Why Its Important To You <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha When evaluating investments the income statement is one of three key financial documents Here we will outline the income statement what to look for and why its important This article is written for nonfinancial types highlighting the basic items to review In particular we will review how to view GAAP earnings versus nonGAAP or operating earnings Recently I wrote Seeking Alpha readers about how to review a corporate balance sheet and cash flow statement The community response was remarkable By request this followon article attempts to provide a similar overview for the income statement The income statement aka profitandloss statement or PL captures a business ongoing financial performance over a period of time This differs from the balance sheet that doc is a snapshot or pointintime of a companys financial foundation The income statement aggregates revenue expenses and records net profit or loss as governed by sometimes arcane GAAP accounting rules In an effort to reflect the performance of the ongoing operation corporate management may create two income statements The first one is the SECmandated GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles document The second is a nonGAAP operating earnings income statement More on this subject later Folks Im no financial guru theres no alphabet soup after my name My objective is to identify what I believe are basic practical investor due diligence markers For todays exercise I selected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp NYSE INTC to be the case study <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>designs and manufactures semiconductors and other digital platforms Its the worlds largest such corporation I selected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp because the company exhibits a relatively clean income statement Nonetheless management provides investors GAAP and nonGAAP versions It presents these in a straightforward easytoread format The Q specifics lend itself to the subject matter as outlined below The income statement contains key segments revenues expenses and net profits When reviewing a PL there are myriad items to check However for this article we will concentrate upon what I believe are the most important investment drivers Listed corporations must file a SEC standard income statement In conjunction with a quarterly earnings release companies typically provide an unaudited statement The SEC filing is published a few days to a few weeks later Please find below the most recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp Q Consolidated Statement of Income It includes data through April Revenue also referred to as Sales or the top line is compared with previous periods At minimum this includes yearoveryear figures As the fiscal year progresses aggregate yeartodate totals should be examined In general I focus upon yearoveryear numbers Indeed most businesses run via a seasonal cycle Of course sometimes a linked quarter check is necessary For instance certain financial sector companies tends to grow or not in each successive quarter the underlying drivers are highly secular in nature not seasonal For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>we see Q revenues totaled billion thereby advancing versus the quarter one year earlier I pay close attention to the top line Its difficult to fiddle with revenue In addition businesses cannot save their way to profitability This is not meant to minimize the fact expense management is a necessary and worthy battle However longterm profitable growth requires upward trending revenue While the income statement reports one or two prior period comps diligent investors may wish to compare the current quarter or fiscal year with multiple previous years results This affords a better feel for the long trend Margin analysis is imperative to good investing Typically margins are expressed as percentages of revenue There are common types of margin analysis Gross margin is Revenue less COGS Cost Of Goods Sold COGS are the direct cost of labor and materials used to make whatever the company produces For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>its semiconductors This figure is divided by Revenue and converted to a percentage In Q Intels asreported gross margin was billion Total revenue was billion Therefore GAAP gross margin percent was This was down from a year earlier Op margin is net Operating Income as a function of Revenue Regular operating expenses are included in this figure but Interest and Taxes are out So are other nonoperating expenses Operating income may be referred to as EBIT Earnings Before Interest and Taxes In the first quarter of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>recorded an operating margin Thats down from in Q Net margin is simply Net Income over Revenue Its the allin number Net margin is the same as the profit margin Armed with this data an investor can now noodle a bit on the facts Despite improving revenue we learned Intels GAAP margins fell acrosstheboard In particular net margins took a big hit That cant be good right This leads us to management operating earnings and associated adjustments Within the quarterly press release report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management includes nonGAAP or operating adjustments along with the unaudited GAAP income statement Many times these differences are acceptable Other times not so much It is up to the investor to ferret out and decide whats OK and whats not This requires work and thought but it separates serious investors from those playing the market Since were talking margins here Ive highlighted gross margin Note how GAAP gross margin fell by points while nonGAAP margin rose points But wait Where were these management adjustments OK boys and girls heres the kicker Good investors seek to understand these adjustments and accept or reject them That takes work This is one reason I strongly encourage regular investors to limit the number of stocks held Without taking the time to perform this sort of evaluation one becomes likely to just accept what management dishes out I have long espoused it takes one hour per week per stock on average to adequately monitor analyze think about and update a corresponding investment thesis Furthermore I contend the less time you spend doing thisyou begin to transition from an investor to a trader or gambler The stock market isnt a good place for retail investors to roll the dice Back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>after reading the earning release notes and reviewing the table above I was willing to accept the Inventory valuation adjustment I rejected excluding Amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets The Deferred revenue writedown might be ok Im wasnt sold on it but since the figure was small I played along After Rays adjustments Im at adjusted gross margin versus in the prior period Therefore I believe the YoY operating margin did not improve It fell Before getting to the bottom line earnings or profits lets take an excursion to discuss the Interest Coverage Ratio This ratio is a helpful way to analyze how comfortably a companys can service its debt Interest Coverage Ratio EBIT Interest Expense Conceptually the objective is to measure how well a business can cover debt service as a function of core earnings EBIT omits interest expense income taxes and may exclude other corporate expenses The reasoning behind this is to isolate base operations Asreported first quarter EBIT was billion In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>booked million net interest expense plus some other expenses We see the YoY net changed from black to red K management discussion notes this was a result of borrowing billion for the Altera acquisition In any event the Interest Coverage Ratio is greater than x Servicing the debt isnt a concern At what level would interest coverage become a concern While somewhat industryspecific I begin to ask questions when the Coverage Ratio is less than x Customarily when computing interest coverage analysts roll up multiple quarters of data Using figures from just one quarter may reflect an aberration or otherwise distorted input Having reviewed the top line margins and a view of a firms ability to service its debt we get to the bottom line net earnings profit and EPS Earnings Per Share Certainly we want to see bottom line earnings growth But theres a bit more to it than just that First its important to look into the numbers and associated earnings narrative to better understand how the growth was obtained This is referred to as earnings quality A second key consideration is how the company fared versus estimates Third we must examine asreported or GAAP results versus management nonGAAP operating results Earnings quality is somewhat subjective The idea is to understand what drove earnings Did EPS rise due to organic revenue growth sound expense management and operational excellence Continuing with our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>example we note the yearoveryear tax rate dropped from to This improved earnings by million or cents per share Significant An extra week Q versus Q boosted revenue This resulted in at least a penny tailwind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reduced the diluted share count by million shares This earnings impact was small However allin these items may have boosted EPS by a nickel Off the asreported EPS thats meaningful It detracts from the reported YoY earnings per share increase I submit Intels Q earnings quality was soso at best The first estimate is provided by many shareholderfriendly management teams Senior leadership offers a quarterly and or annual EPS target or target range It may be indirect Often operational and financial forecasts are given to allow an investor to model a buildup to the bottom line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>provides investors enough input to formulate a reasonable model From the Q earnings release heres what they provided to estimate Q GAAP and nonGAAP operating results Running the numbers I estimated firstquarter EPS My estimate required making a few basic assumptions for example the tax rate and the share count were not provided explicitly We see management states the other figures have some slop built in by adding the word approximately Thats ok Based upon company input and my model the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>beat its firstquarter GAAP estimate it recorded EPS versus a estimate However we revealed how Q results inflated by a soft tax rate and a longer quarter Weak earnings quality took some shine off So Id call it more of a wash Now the second or real earnings estimate is the Street estimate The Street estimate is the consensus of Wall Street analysts Notably they often run as a herd In addition its important to note Street estimates reflect nonGAAP operating results There are numerous online sources to check Street estimates leading up to the earnings release date and how the actual operating earnings fared versus these expectations Like it or not the Street estimates often carry more weight than management guidance This is due to several reasons that go beyond the scope of this article An Excursion GAAP versus nonGAAP operating EPS Investors must think critically about the genesis and derivation of the nonGAAP operating results To often the Street simply accepts what management dishes out Sometimes its a clear picture of the true underlying operation reflecting reasonable puts and takes however other times a stew of ifs ands and buts that simply inflate earnings numbers Unfortunately the use of nonGAAP earnings figures and the difference between GAAP and nonGAAP earnings is heading in wrong direction The following chart was created by FactSet NYSE FDS Currently about of the SP companies report nonGAAP or operating earnings up from only in Clearly just over the past year the spread between GAAP and nonGAAP operating earnings wideneda lot <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>reported yearoveryear operating earnings of in Q versus in Q As outlined above I questioned some of the nonGAAP adjustments Rays operating earnings were Going through a like process for Q operating results I suggest operating EPS was for the period The YoY cent improvement is robust until an unusuallylow tax rate and an extra week in the Q quarter is considered Those items bumped EPS by or so That pales the comp Perhaps Mr Market recognized these observations Post the first quarter earnings release INTC stock traded with the NASDAQ average until the week of June It has outperformed since that time Recent headline news may be the reason Click to enlarge courtesy of googlecomfinance Second quarter Street earnings estimates have been flat to down slightly Current EPS consensus is With a week or so before the Q release the Street has aligned itself with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>managements Q EPS guidance of approximately For information management guidance provided in conjunction with the Q press release is found below As my regular readers are aware I am not a fan of EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization My view is this measurement is a contrived income statement derivative Adjusted EBITDA is even worse If the measure is meant to be a surrogate for cash flow then I suggest turning to the cash flow statement Nevertheless EBITDA is utilized by certain business types and bankers especially with respect to determining financial leverage EBITDA is also used to run some economic valuations models Therefore I acknowledge the metric From timetotime its necessary to consider it But I dont like it I look forward to your questions and comments Please do your own careful due diligence before
