Wars The Battle For Automotive Tech <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha The battle lines are being drawn for what promises to be one of the most interesting tech industry developments in the next several years From a platform and technology perspective this is a battle that will have several different fronts With the announcement late last week by BMW OTCPKBAMXY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC and Mobileye NYSE MBLY of a new reference platform for autonomous cars expected to be available in model year vehicles the battle lines are being drawn for what promises to be one of the most interesting tech industry developments in the next several years On the one side you have tech giants Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL who also happen to be the two most valuable companies in the world Either in secret or openly theyre working to create automotive platforms and possibly even cars themselves leveraging their software and user experience expertise On the other you have the automakers several of whom used to be among the list of the worlds largest companies As a group they are painfully aware of how critical technology has become in the car purchasing process yet extremely concerned about how the partnerships they need to match these new requirements could lead to a loss of control or at least a major decline in customer influence In the middle you have a range of the most important andor most innovative semiconductor companies names like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and ARM NASDAQ ARMH hungry for a new growth market and eager to cash in on what many expect to be one of strongest segments of the tech hardware economy for the next decade Topping off this tasty automotive tech sandwich are some of the first widespread deployments of cutting edge technologies like deep learning neural networks artificial intelligence and advanced connectivity technologies think G all of which are necessary to make the promise of truly autonomous cars a reality Toss in the disruptive business model innovations of ridesharing companies like Uber Private UBER and Lyft Private LYFT and things start to get even more interesting Add in the political and regulatory intrigue bound to impact the market as the result of the unfortunate first accidental death of a driver using an autonomous driving feature on a Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Model S and its not hard to imagine the screenplay of a movie thriller nearly writing itself From a platform and technology perspective this is a battle that will have several different fronts The two main campaigns will likely focus on a cars infotainment system and its autonomous driving capabilities The truth is cars have grown into enormously complex devices see this recent column I wrote for USA Today for more but these two separate systems are seen as the crown jewels of automotive tech While infotainment used to essentially mean the car radio and navigation system it has blossomed into the cars entire interface Everything from the cars internal app platform to headsup displays interactive gauges comfort controls driving assistance features and more are shown to the cars occupants through the various displays and components that make up todays advanced infotainment systems At the moment Apples CarPlay and Googles Android Auto are staking out a portion of the infotainment software experience although not all of its expanded reach For obvious reasons carmakers have been reticent to give over the entire user experience to the tech giants Underneath the hood of the infotainment system companies like Nvidia Qualcomm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and ARM licensees such as Renesas STMicro and TI have all provided semiconductor components that are driving the infotainment experience Given the increasingly visual nature of these elements expect to see a lot more discussion around carbased graphics The autonomous driving capabilities are being handled through a combination of different elements some of which are on the car and some of which are expected to be delivered via the cloud Last weeks BMW <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Mobileye announcement for example leverages the sensor fusion and machine vision experience from Mobileye on the car while also using local <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>CPUs and a connection to an Inteldriven cloud computing resource running deep learning and neural network applications Nvidia has also been prominent in moving forward with distributed computing autonomous driving experiences The company has debuted its DrivePX platform for doing the oncar computing and inferencing for driver assistance and autonomous drive applications while also talking about its cloudbased GPUdriven neural network efforts In addition to these two main systems there are a number of other critical elements some of which provide links between them Notably the communications capabilities of todays cars is about to surpass any device we own Qualcomm for example just debuted a new upgradeable automotive communications platform that incorporates radios for G WiFi Bluetooth and DSRC a technology expected to be used for future vehicletovehicle communications Connectivity is critical for both infotainment and autonomous driving as well as things like overtheair software upgrades and much more so expect to see some increased competition here as well Despite all these recent developments it will likely be the end of the decade before we really know how the car wars play themselves out In the meantime its going to be one of the most epic battlegrounds for both new world and old world businesses the market has seen in quite some time Who knows It could end up being the technological stuff of legend Editors Note
