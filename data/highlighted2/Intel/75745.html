style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Altera a kind of deal FPGAs Field Programmable Gate Arrays came on the scene from Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX in They were slow low density expensive power hogs but easy to configure for a small custom logic design The first couple of generations were pretty useless except for very specialized applications We had a term for the usage case for FPGAs Protoduction That meant that FPGAs could be used in certain prototype and low volume production applications If an application was successful and went to high volume the FPGA was replaced with and ASIC Application Specific Integrated Circuit at one tenth the price The state of the semiconductor technology back then was two micron and logic layout and design was cheap The promise for FPGAs was that as the semiconductor technology advanced and logic design for ASICs became more expensive FPGAs would find a more mainstream market than Protoduction As of the FPGA market is somewhere around billion primarily divided between Altera NASDAQ ALTR and Xilinx The largest use markets for FPGAs have in communication infrastructure and industrial applications FPGAs are funny little critters They come from the factory as blank arrays of gates the building blocks of all things digital Think of them as blank black boards The logic designer using very sophisticated CAD Computer Aided Design tools designs the logic that will occupy this blank piece of silicon When that design is completed it is loaded into the FPGA and like magic the blank piece of silicon becomes a digital electronic function from something simple to something intensely complex Also like magic if the power is turned off that FPGA goes back to a blank piece of silicon ready for another logic function to be loaded So a clever designer can use the same piece of silicon for many different logic designs as long as the functions dont have to operate at the same time Dr Moore must giggle when thinking about FPGAsthe same set of transistors used over and over again for different hardware function This is Moores Law In the years since FPGAs appeared the cost area of transistors has decreased by a factor of nm to nm At the same time the cost of designing logic ASIC devices has increased geometrically to the point that a complex ASIC can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to design and get ready for production in a bleeding edge semiconductor technology node Recently these cost curves have caused a tipping point to appear that makes it easier quicker and cheaper to use FPGAs in all but the very highest volume custom chip application While this has happened the FPGA has retained the absolutely unique ability to change function on the fly thus multiplying its value and functionality <span

conjunction with high performance server CPU chips to enhance the throughput and reduce the power requirement of data centers There are immensely complex algorithms that can now be performed by the hard logic of an FPGA at much higher speed and much lower power than could be done by the server chip alone These functions can also change if necessary by simply sending the new configuration file to the FPGAs Outside of the data center imagine a small FPGA embedded in a smartphone application processor and think about the potential for hardware logic based apps vs software apps Think about logic designs that are unique to a particular smartphone manufacturer What if Apple NASDAQ AAPL whispered to silicon suppliers that the next A chip supplier would not be the guy with the smallest node but the guy who could supply a chip with a section of programmable logic to be used by Apple for the next big thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>might have paid too much for Altera or they might have paid a reasonable price for company that has just hit a tipping point that is not recognized by the headscratching analysts yet The deal is slightly accretive to Intels earnings and may get much more so over time One thing for certain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has taken Altera out of the realm of fabless semiconductors back into the world of IDM Integrated Device Manufacturer with the attendant significantly lower production costs Xilinx should be very very afraid There is no equivalent acquirer for Xilinx that has a lock on the server
