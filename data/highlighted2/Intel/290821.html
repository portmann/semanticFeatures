Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article forecast was not that impressive After the bell on Thursday chip giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC reported its fourth quarter results While the company beat on the top and bottom lines for Q guidance wasnt as strong as it could have been With sentiment in the name at a multiyear high results were not strong enough to send the stock higher in the afterhours The fourth quarter numbers showed an interesting result The best number was perhaps a decline in Client Computing Group revenues which is the PC mobile segment With PC sales dropping off in Q this was a bright spot However the Data Center Group only saw a revenue increase of after a more than rise through the first nine months of With the DCG being the highlight of future growth you would have liked to see the DCG do a bit better Also the large EPS beat was primarily due to a much lower than expected tax rate The most disappointing parts of this report perhaps came in the full year forecast Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>originally provided guidance back in November but this was prior to the completion of the Altera acquisition The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>only went from mid single digit growth to mid to high single digit growth for revenues seems a bit conservative When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>closed the Altera deal analysts were looking for about billion in revenues during from Altera That alone represented about of Intels full year revenues and if you add an extra week in Intels period is weeks you are looking at about As a result you would have expected Intels guidance to be just high single digits Remember the Altera acquisition and the extra week in the fiscal period will account for more than half of the companys revenue growth in Organic growth is in the low single digits Because of Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also lowered its GAAP gross margin forecast to for with a nonGAAP forecast of compared to the previous forecast for Additionally one of the keys to profitability has been operating expenses which have continued to rise as seen in the chart below Management originally guided to RD plus MGA expenses as a percentage of revenues coming down by half a percentage point in If we assume roughly of revenue growth GAAP guidance implies just an bps improvement whereas nonGAAP guidance called for about bps Remember this doesnt include two other important charges amortization and restructuring which I included in the chart above Thanks to the Altera acquisition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>guided to about million of amortization expenses this year well above the five year average of million I also assume that there will be restructuring expenses but management did not give those as part of guidance With all of these operating expenses continuing to rise profitability improvements cannot be made Thus when we look at Intels overall forecast I calculate Intels EPS on a GAAP basis in a range of to The street was looking for so this definitely looks light On a nonGAAP basis I get to The difference is primarily in gross margins as well as more than cents of amortization expenses Both of these ranges use for revenue growth along with moderate restructuring expenses and no buyback Overall this guidance seemed to include a bit more Altera expenses than some might have expected There will be some choppiness in the results for the next few quarters as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shifts to a GAAP nonGAAP basis whereas the company had only been GAAP in recent years One item I should point out is that the bear camp has really run away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in recent years As you can see in the chart below short interest finished at around million shares Thats the lowest point seen since I started tracking Intels short interest in April Since the peak almost of shares short have been covered so there has been a major shift in sentiment regarding the name <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shares were down about in the afterhours and I think thats a fair response to the companys report The Data Center Group slowed a bit in Q and guidance disappointed in a number of respects With the fall in shares the annual dividend yield is up to about which makes the name worth a look for income investors I stated in my previous article that I believed fair value for the stock was in the mid s Investors might want to use this weakness to buy for the longterm but I dont think investors should expect tremendous upside in the near term </div></body></html>
