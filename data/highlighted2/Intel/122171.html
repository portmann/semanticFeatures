AMD lost money again in Q and revised previous guidance to a money losing second half AMDs semicustom business has become a lifeline as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>continues to take share in the PC market Increasingly AMD NASDAQ AMD is living handtomouth surviving on the semicustom devices commissioned by its Angel Customers Angel Customers pay AMD cash upfront to cover the nonrecurring engineering NRE costs that other semiconductor houses absorb as part of normal operating expenses Following the earnings call on July it occurred to me that collaboration on a semicustom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture SOC would be a winwin for both Apple NASDAQ AAPL and AMD For all we know such a collaboration may already be underway In my AMD earnings preview article I had expressed my skepticism regarding the guidance that AMD gave at their Analyst Day meeting for a return to profitability in the second half of the year I was particularly interested to see if AMD would stick to this guidance in the conference call About the only surprise in the call was how quickly AMD backed away from the guidance CFO Devinder Kumar blurted it out in his prepared remarks Due to the recent change in the PC market outlook our goal of second half profitability has been pushed out AMD does expect revenue to rise for Q to about million up from this quarters million This will be due largely to a seasonal increase to support game consoles as well as the new products that AMD is introducing Carrizo architecture processors and R Fury graphics cards However this will represent a yy decline in Q a slight improvement from the Q yy decline AMDs gross margins continue to erode Last year AMDs already low gross margin stood at This year its down to In contrast Intels NASDAQ INTC gross margin for Q was Intels much greater gross margin demonstrates its nearmonopoly power in the market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture processors AMDs operating loss of resided primarily in Computing and Graphics Segment CGS which posted a million loss Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom EESC managed to eke out a small million profit EESC has now become the mainstay of AMD producing most of the revenue and all of the profit AMD announced a third semicustom design start for Q to go with the two other wins from last year AMD indicated that the first two have lifetime revenue value of billion each while the latest is in the million range The console and other semicustom wins which at first seemed merely a supplement to the CGS business have become vital to the companys survival It is against the financial backdrop of AMDs Q and H guidance that a possible involvement by Apple needs to be understood AMD while in somewhat dire straits financially nevertheless possesses technology of value to Apple and other PC makers as well In both graphics processing and in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture processors Apple has an interest Apple also has an interest in ensuring that AMD doesnt go under thereby leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>with an absolute monopoly in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture processors on which Apple depends for its Mac computer line Macs are already expensive and an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>monopoly would only make them more expensive In addition to the negative incentives there are many positive incentives Apple has found that there are benefits to designing its own ARM processors for its iOS devices Among those benefits one of the most important is that Apple is able to incorporate only the functionality that it needs to support its mobile devices When buying a commodity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>processor for its Macs the situation is very different Designers of commodity processors tend to build in numerous interfaces and functions in a one size fits all approach Often the interfaces and functions supplied by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in its chips go unused in Apple products This was brought home to me by the recent release of the new MacBook with Retina Display which uses the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Core M The Core M is designed as a general purpose PC processor with the usual interfaces for hard drives USB etc as shown in the diagram below courtesy Anandtech The key takeaway from the chart is that Apple isnt using a lot of that stuff Instead of the Serial ATA hard drive or SSD controller Apple has its own proprietary flash memory controller as detailed in the iFixit teardown Apple has used the new USB C port as the sole interface for the MacBook rather than USB or If Apple commissioned a semicustom processor from AMD it could do away with the surplusage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and spec exactly what it wants in terms of CPU and graphics capability Intels SOCs continue to be a little light on graphics capability In recent leaked benchmarks for Carrizo graphics it outperformed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Iris Pro graphics by a factor of In addition AMD advertises that it can bring proprietary customer IP onto the semicustom chip as well So in this case AMD could integrate Apples flash memory controller AMD would probably not have been a viable candidate for Apple if it werent for the fact that nm FinFET is now a reality at Samsung OTCSSNLF and TSMC NYSE TSM Even if the new processes arent quite as good as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>theyre probably good enough to support the performance requirements of Apple MacBooks Apple highlighted the latest MacBook as the future of the notebook indicating that future Apple notebooks will dispense with cooling fans This means that Apple would be looking for a post Carrizo probably Zen based design fabricated on nm that would also not require a fan This is probably within the capability of AMD starting in The most important benefit to Apple would be getting a processor for about half of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>charges for the Core M listed at for lots of This would go a long way towards achieving the goal I discussed in my latest article on the Mac of reducing the cost of the MacBook without compromising quality This would greatly expand the market for the Mac as I discussed in Apples Laptop Opportunity Apple sells about million Macs most of them laptops every quarter so theres a significant opportunity for AMD If only of those Macs were equipped with AMD processors that would add about million to AMDs top line every quarter And thats just for starters AMD could expand their presence in the Mac lineup as well as earn prestige for being in one of the most desirable notebook computers I believe the chances of a collaboration are good Apple is clearly motivated to reduce the cost of its notebooks while improving the performance of the fanless type of notebook that will become a staple of the Mac lineup Clearly AMD is motivated to place themselves at Apples disposal At the very least Im sure AMD has pitched this to Apple Even if Apple doesnt take them up on this the semicustom approach may win converts among other PC manufacturers looking to differentiate their products Of course there may be other semicustom wins in the server category as well If AMD cant beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the commodity market it can at least carve out a niche as a supplier of semicustom processors for laptops and other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture computers Based on the number of semicustom wins alone its fair to say that AMD has moved beyond game consoles This is probably the only future that AMD has but it is at least a future in which AMD can begin to grow again For this reason I see as a potential watershed year for the company It may be the year that AMD finally abandons the commodity PC market and fully embraces its role as a custom processor designer for hire In that role AMD may be a much smaller company but it will also be a much more profitable company
