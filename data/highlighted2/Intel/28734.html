Seeking Alpha Data Center Group takes operating profit leadership Client and Mobile to diminish in importance The highlight of Intels NASDAQ INTC Q earnings call along with the recent rumors of possible acquisitions of Altera NASDAQ ALTR and Broadcom NASDAQ BCOM is the recognition by Wall St that the company has made the longterm turn toward being a high growth Data Center Centric company as mobile recedes in the background CEO Brian Krzanich just two years into his tenure has made the most of his manufacturing background to prioritize Intels investments around a business unit that revenue wise should exceed the client group within five years and possibly set up barriers that no ARMbased server competitor will be able to break into given the complexities of the whole server system design Before Paul Otellini retired from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>he highlighted the doubledigit growth that servers were experiencing due to the rise of data required to service the explosion of smart phones and tablets Furthermore he recognized that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>made more profits with each additional server than they would capture in silicon in the mobile space It went unappreciated by analysts and investors Thus the investment in mobile had to continue until the company saved face by losing over B in in order to show the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was serious As mentioned in previous columns the real solution to mobile for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was nm Broadwell that allowed Apple NASDAQ AAPL and others to design much lighter weight fully functional PCs with over hours of battery life at a reasonable price Tablets have since withered at the hands of Intels assault While ASPs are down mobile volume is up and margins in the Client Group remain strong based on the Broadwell die shrink and the elimination of AMD NASDAQ AMD and NVidia NASDAQ NVDA as a threat Apples new MacBook remains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>contrary to many ARM NASDAQ ARMH skeptics who imagined for years that a conversion was in the cards Apple recognizes that corporates and professionals expect the Mac OS with horsepower and will not risk brand destruction on the switch out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>for ARM This means Intels lock on the profitable PC market is ensured even if demand remains staid Keep an eye on the MU of PCs that are over years old The attractiveness of subpound ultralight notebooks will drive growth On the call Krzanich confirmed a strategy that I have outlined previously which is that customers prefer to create a wide range of mobile PCs and tablets from one platform More specifically they are using Broadwell with its standard footprint and multiple price points in places that used to use Atom Broadwell combined with alternative chipsets on one substrate is as effective as Atom in terms of physical size but much faster to market and more flexible in terms of cost and performance More importantly it is much more in tune with fab loading and maximizing Broadwells volume leading to ever lower costs Some readers will squabble but Atom is dead as Dead as Itanium was a decade before the burial Rumors of acquiring Altera and Broadcom are circulating in the news for good reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is looking at a host of technologies partnerships and companies that will set up high barriers to entry in the Data Center Intels leading process technology is best utilized in the server space where the value proposition is easily quantified in operationswatt or performancewatt Every new generation of Moores Law works in Intels favor as it shows dramatic improvements and allows for price increases that offset lower Data Center power and cooling expenses As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>looks across the entire server platform it realizes that ASPs and revenue can increase dramatically if it can closely couple memory and drives thus reducing latencies in transactions An acquisition of Altera could pay off if their Stratix FPGAs are moved forward to nm ahead of Xilinx and as a result dominate in the market for accelerators and the building of leading edge high speed networks Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Huawai would be major customers If an ARM player is to make inroads in the server space they will need to create an ecosystem that is as competitive as Intels A key building block will be networking which Broadcom is recognized as the leader An acquisition of Broadcom by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would block any ARM processor player from making a run at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the near term Do the Feds understand that a monopoly move is in play I doubt it and therefore am interested in how the mergers activity evolves for the rest of For now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in the drivers seat and we have not even been given a view on when nm rolls out After the PC reset in Q Growth is the
