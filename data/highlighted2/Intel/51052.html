Product Roadmap Leak Some Salvation For Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMDs product roadmap leaked Im still bearish on the companys fundamentals despite the positive news The company will move to a more advanced nm node which will result in power efficiency gains with a marginal improvement in performance It will be late to the party but at least the company is keeping up In the leak AMD will release a nm ARMbased tablet CPU which will compete directly with Qualcomm and TSM Needless to say AMD will find that its difficult to engage Qualcomm in mobile devices AMDs lowmargin lowend PC business could run into a shrinking tower PC market AMDs NASDAQ AMD product roadmap leaked on an off the radar website The initial leak came from the forums of PlanetDNow a foreign website on April th Now I have never heard of this website until recently But with other reputable sources like Extreme Tech Fudzilla and Digital Trends jumping on the leak Im taking the liberty to update my stance on AMD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC will be running on nd generation architecture at the nm node by the end of So it doesnt necessarily mean that AMD is going to be getting the better of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>quite yet But at least AMD has a plan and while its not getting ahead of its rival its at least keeping up In terms of density <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will have an advantage as its on a nd generation FinFET GlobalFoundries is still on a first generation process when it comes to dimensional transistor layering and while performance does scale with dimensional transistors its not exactly clear whether AMD will keep up much less pull ahead Since this is leaked footage of AMDs upcoming roadmap we dont have projected performance figures from AMD At best we can anticipate modest improvement from AMDs prior generation products Increase in performance will be in terms of power efficiency but IPC instruction per cycle will improve marginally AMD will operate on a nm node Yields wont be great as it takes a while for fabs to optimize yieldcost ratios <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>anticipates that its gross margins will be as good as Haswell at nm by the end of Also Skylake will be an improvement to architecture and will be rolled out in conjunction with Windows The timing of Intels more advanced CPUs is impeccable but the dropoff in demand for tower PCs doesnt really help as various industry reports indicate that PC demand could shrink for the current year Admittedly we will have to wait until were within months away from the holiday season to get real supply chain confirmation Inventory is going to be burned in the upcoming quarter which will result in falling profitability and revenue There are no notable upside catalysts in play as AMD hasnt developed enough scale to become a truly disruptive competitor in the desktop laptop tablet and mobile space AMD will need to improve its cost to performance ratio in order to gain laptoptablet design wins Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM remains dominant in tablets with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>a distant second The slides indicate that AMD will design an ARMbased chip for tablet devices and quite frankly I wish them luck Qualcomms ability to bundle IP across MEMs MCUs modems CPUsGPUs lowers cost and increases performance TSM NYSE TSM operates its fabs extremely efficiently which is why I believe the Qualcomm TSM duo will be difficult for AMD to compete with even if they were to sacrifice gross margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still bleeding money in mobile and if AMD were to engage I cant imagine the situation to be any different For now AMD is doing its best to survive I think AMD will at least make it to nm and will continue to generate volume in budget oriented PCs Its certainly not a winning strategy which is why I remain skeptical and bearish of AMD Source AMD Product Roadmap Leak Some Salvation For Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
