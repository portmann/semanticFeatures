link or you will be banned from the site Perhaps It Wasnt Such A Good Idea To Leave The Fate Of The Tech Bubble In The Hands Of Apple Just before the last AAPL earnings call we showed something extraordinary all of the tech sectors growth in Q was in the hands of just one company Apple In other words take Apple away and the entire thesis for why the tech bubble is different this time namely companies that have rising profits falls apart Fast forward to this quarter when AAPL just reported earnings that as its stock price indicates were clearly not in the sweet spot of priced to perfection market expectations driven by weaker than expected iPhone sales a slowdown in China which took place before its stock market crashed a warning that the strong dollar is now impacting AAPL profitability as well virtually no color on iWatch sales and finally concerns about the companys guidance But the reason why the tech sector may suddenly be getting cold feet about pinning the entire second tech bubble on AAPL and make no mistake it is a bubble is that as Factset reported Apple is expected to be the largest contributor to earnings growth for the Information Technology sector for Q The blended earnings growth rate combines actual results for companies that have reported and estimated results for companies yet to report for the Information Technology sector is Which is why the response to all those who say SP earnings are not negative if you exclude energy is that if you exclude tumbling energy earnings but also exclude AAPL SP earnings are once again negative Now since AAPL beat consensus EPS just barely it meant that this is the th consecutive quarter that Apple has been the largest contributor to earnings growth for the Information Technology sector And here why both AAPL and the Nasdaq are swooning as we reported last night it is all about iPhone sales and these disappointed What is driving Apples substantial contribution to earnings growth for the Information Technology sector in recent quarters The iPhone product segment has reported revenue growth in excess of in the previous two quarters and is projected to report revenue growth of in Q However yearoveryear comparisons for iPhone sales become more challenging in Q Unlike the first three quarters of the year the exclusion of Apple from the Information Technology sector is not predicted to cause a substantial decline in yearoveryear earnings growth for the sector in the fourth quarter The WSJ adds some more dramatic statistics Apple has a big impact on the overall market as well Since the third quarter of Apple for every single quarter has comprised no less than of the SP s operating earnings according to data from SP Dow Jones Indices It accounted for of the indexs operating earnings of in September and has ranged higher since then In the first quarter of it comprised of the operating profit In the fourth quarter of it was of the profit Think of its this way If all of the companies in the index contributed an even amount Apples earnings would account for about of the overall profit On the contrary Apple is by far the single biggest contributor to the indexs earnings The next largest contributor is JP Morgan which is contributed about half of that at cents For comparison sake this is what other tech names are contributing Microsoft Inc estimated cents IBM cents Google Inc cents Cisco Systems Inc estimated cents <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp cents The SP is expected to see secondquarter profits contract by about from a year ago according to data from FactSet If Apple werent part of that the contraction would be significantly larger Given its marketcap weighting its contribution to the indexs overall earningscurrently estimated at will work out to about If you subtracted that contribution just to show how much Apple matters the earnings contraction would widen out to about Here is the most stunning chart showing just how reliant on AAPL not only the tech sector is but the entire SP And this is where China comes in As we showed yesterday while China sales rose solidly YY Q was the weakest quarter of fiscal Much of this may be due to the iPhone new release cycle but suddenly the biggest question mark is how will the crashing Chinese stock market impact local consumer enddemand this is something neither AAPL management nor Wall Street analysts had factored into their EPS or iPhone sales forecasts As we already know the bursting bubble which Beijing and the PBOC are scrambling with every passing day to keep alive has already impacted housing see China Stock Rout Rocks Property Market Massive Cancellations Expected How likely is it that general spending and retail sales will also be hammered And furthermore the modest miss in iPhone sales happened in a quarter in which China had not yet seen the bursting of its stock bubble the true collapse happened in just the last days of June and onward in July ie AAPLs last quarter How immodest would it have been had the crash happened in June or May or April Which means that suddenly not only are Apple phone sales but also all the hopes of a positive earnings growth in the Tech sector as well as overall EPS growth for the SP pegged on one thing whether the Chinese consumer will continue buying Apple products at a time when trillions in market cap ie wealth effect was wiped out We dont know the answer and neither does anyone else but we have a very distinct feeling that the tech bubble which is now reliant almost exclusively on AAPL to keep the this time its different theme alive is suddenly not all that excited that as its foundation it has an AAPL stock whose fate in turn is dependent on how well a centrallyplanning communist party halfway around the globe can keep its own bubble growing in what everyone now admits is a quasinationalized stock market Wed bigdumbnugly Wed Tom Servo Wed NidStyles I said it when Jobs announced that he was terminally ill that was the end of Apples reign Without Jobs there is no guiding force in that company to keep it on track and push that reality distortion field forward I also said give it years and Apple will be essentially dead Looks like Im still on time with my call Wed detachedamusement Apple would have been dead long ago without that idiotic gimmick of adding color to the outside of a computer Wed tarsubil It is insane the amount of money that has been spent on the iPhone in the last couple years Youd think it would slow down but not yet Do people finance these phones I just dont get it Wed KnuckleDraggerX Apple has always relied on the coolness factor but the real world is worrying more and more about just staying afloat They are sitting on a mountain of cash but avoiding the IRS kind of puts a crimp in their style But not to worry Christmas will save them as long as theres no weather Wed lasvegaspersona Yeahlooking at your wrist to get the time of day is passe Jobs would have figured that out over lunch Little Timmahjust cant provide the insightno mojo I guess Wed seek Ive commented on this recently but I do research in the tech sector and if you look at actual shipment data QQ of was actually a bigger collapse than Q Q The saving grace has been gaming the data with cheap products low prices but you can maintain unit volumes and higher prices on normal products keeps revenues at a similar level However if you look at historically consistent products say conventional desktop PCs or even Apples iPad which has been around for years the collapse is beyond evident Does it feeeeel right Then everything is fine Wed Amish FinEng OMG is anyone else feel a very bad feeling about The English economy Jacob just said that sales at our Amish furniture store have dried up and not many English tourists Something is wrong and I have a very bad feeling almost like I think some English will die during the next big crash Wed Redart But it is also true that AAPL is trading at a serious valuation discount to the SPX while paying a dividend similar to the SPX In other words this company who just posted year over year significant sales growth is trading as if sales and earning shrank It is a relative bargain if sales remain flat It is a steal if sales and earnings continue any climb at all Wed Huh Reeeally Tech has been disappointing for years especially in the phone products Who remembers Nokia or Palm Pilot or even Blackberry Samsung is beginning to eclipse Apple across the board because their products are being perceived as more useful and relevant Not a great loss if apple facebook and google were to be replaced by USER friendly products rather than government friendly recording devices Wed Freddie I think more and more foreign companies and some people want less and less USSA spywarespy hardware from the En Es Aye Why would a European or Asian company or any company take a chace on USSA spyware technology All your secrets stolen in real time Wed pragmatic hobo its just staggering how many iphones they sell quarter after quarter just who fuck are buying up that shit it really wouldnt surprise me is aapl is pulling wmt and buying up their own shit and stashing them in warehouse somewhere in china to fabricate their sales numbers its just mind boggling how chinese making per month can buy up billions of dollars of fucking iphone when equally capable chinese made phones are available at fraction of cost Wed bankonzhongguo To make matters even more prescient one of these days the Chinese will have their own Apple product able to penetrate all markets at a fraction of Apples bloated street price By comparison look at Fit Bit verses Xiaomis substitute same thing one quarter the price And considering US colleges PREFER overseas students for all those EECS degrees and out of state tuition it is only a matter of years before all the Millennial software engineers careers are over at age and consumer gear margins drive off with Uber to Airbnb If China ever orient itself to a low impact operating system to replace MS then say goodbye to other other sectors too Wed booboo If you wear an I Watch to a job interview you are a shoe in they usualy invite the head of Human Resources in half way through the interview just to look at your greatness Eskimos are claiming that baby seals club themselves if they see them with I watches Panties fall off women if they see you wearing one and instantly have three to ten minute orgasmic blow outs Wed Peribanu Wow thats just amazing Where can I get one Is it compatible with my Android and Windows Phones Hey why did everyone leave the room Wed The Delicate Genius But sure as Americans are apparently all selfishly saving or unselfishly trapped in their homes due to snow drifts drifts which also took down their ISP theres less consuming so less making of things to be consumed Wed Mike Honcho Back in the day the stock to get into was car
