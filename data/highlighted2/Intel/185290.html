Company Ltd TSM Includes AAPL INTC SSNLF by Mark Hibben Data from iPhone s and s Plus teardowns indicates that TSMC is fabricating Apples custom processors for the s Plus TSMC only started the production ramp for its nm FinFET process in July Despite a late start in TSMCs nm FinFET process TSMC NYSE TSM appears to have captured up to a third of chip production for Apples latest iPhones TSMC is only the second ARM foundry to put FinFETs into production after Samsung OTC SSNLF TSMCs impressive accomplishment paves the way for it to replace Samsung The combined resources of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and TSMC could bring about the next process node nm as much as a year ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC Despite the bad blood between Apple and Samsung Samsung has been making the A systems on chip SOC for the new iPhone s Apple had no choice but to turn to Samsung since it wanted to use Samsungs nm FinFET process the most advanced available from an ARM foundry Samsung has been in production on the new process since early in the year in order to support the launch of its own Galaxy S smartphone in March Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing was racing to get its own comparable nm FinFET process into production but only started the production ramp in July Based on the late start of TSMC I had assumed that TSMC would not be in iPhone ss Plus when the phones were ready to launch in September Despite what I called a strengthening partnership I argued that TSMCs production ramp was just cutting it too close to make it into the iPhone s launch TSMCmade SOCs would appear in iPhone s in Q Now that the new iPhones have started to be delivered it appears I was wrong about TSMC Based on teardowns by iFixit of the iPhone s and iPhone s Plus it appears that TSMC is making the A SOC for the s Plus while Samsung is making the A SOC for the s Sales of the s Plus could be about onethird of total ss Plus sales so this is a huge win for TSMC and something of a minor miracle How do I know which parts are which Briefly it has to do with the part numbering scheme that Samsung and TSMC use In the table below I summarize the part numbers It has been well known that Samsung made the original A SOC for the iPhone s Likewise its also well known that TSMC made the A SOC that went into both the iPhone and Plus To ramp up production of a new process from a more or less standing start into volumes sufficient to support an iPhone launch is extremely impressive It shows how badly TSMC wanted Apples business and it also shows how badly Apple wants to divorce itself from Samsung Apple was taking something of a chance on TSMC Even though Apple probably had Samsung make some extra As for the s Plus just for backup s Plus availability would have been very tight if TSMC hadnt come through Early benchmark results appear to confirm most of the performance increase Apple promised for the A during the September event of CPU increase and GPU increase Also it doesnt appear that theres any significant speed difference between the s and s Plus versions indicating that TSMCs chips are equivalent and interchangeable with Samsung The speed improvements tend to substantiate the assumption that the nm FinFET processes are being used even though the chips themselves have not been inspected yet This is because the new iPhones use slightly smaller batteries despite the speed improvements PC Magazine also has compared benchmark results for the iPhone s with the Samsung Galaxy S and the Galaxy Note In most of the tests the new iPhones came out substantially faster in both CPU and GPU performance This indicates that Apples custom SOCs maintain a significant lead over Samsung for equivalent manufacturing processes Whether this lead will translate into significant market share gains for Apple remains to be seen I believe that they will when combined with the other new features and improvements of the iPhone s such as D Touch iOS and the improved front and rear cameras But the important takeaway is that both Samsung and Apple as practitioners of custom SOC design are completely dominant compared to everyone else TSMCs breakneck production ramp combined with the intense rivalry between Apple and Samsung make it all but inevitable that TSMC will completely supplant Samsung as a supplier of foundry services by the end of the year The fact that TSMCs chips are equivalent in performance to Samsung means that Apple in no way suffers competitively by severing its ties with Samsung TSMCs impressive performance in partnership with Apple lends some credibility to a rumor that recently surfaced that the next generation A SOC could be fabricated on a nm process At TSMCs June quarter earnings telecon TSMC stated that it was on track to start nm process qualification by the end of this year with volume production by the end of Based on what TSMC has accomplished this projection has much more credibility now in my mind Lets take a step back and look at the big picture A year ago when I was projecting the imminent arrival of nm FinFET processes in the ARM foundries I was still being heckled by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>supporters who claimed it would never happen Now that the ARM foundries have ramped up their own FinFET processes its apparent that bit ARM SOCs are extremely powerful In benchmarks Apples A puts to shame any Atom SOC even the X and X series that are fabricated on Intels own nm process And people have started to notice as I pointed out earlier this year when the AX appeared in the iPad Air that Apples SOCs are starting to surpass even Intels Core M series Now the AppleTSMC partnership is poised to jump out in front of <span

process in production as much as a year ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Chances are Samsung will be in this race as well with their own nm process Editors Note This
