site Submitted by David Stockman via Contra Corner blog If you have forgotten your Gullivers Travels recall that Jonathan Swift described the people of Brobdingnag asbeing as tall as church steeples and having a ten foot stride Everything else was in proportion with rats the size of mastiffs and the latter the size of four elephants while flies were as big as a Dunstable lark and wasps werethe size of partridges Hence the word for this fictional landhas come to mean colossalenormousgigantic huge immense or as the urban dictionary puts it really fcking big That would also describe the billion bubble whichcomprises Amazons market cap It is at once brobdangnagian and preposterous a trick on the casino signifying that the crowd has onceagain gone stark ravingmad When you have arrived at a condition of extreme irrational exuberance there is probably no insult to ordinary valuation metrics that can shock But for wantof doubt consider that AMZN earned the grand sum of million last quarter and million for the LTM period ending in September Thats right Its conventional PE multiple is X And no its not a biotech startup in phase FDA trials with a sure fire cancer cure set to be approved any day its actually been around more than a quartercentury putting it in the oldest quartile of businesses in the US But according tothe loony posse ofsellside apologists who cover the companythere are buy recommendationsAmazon is still furiously investing in growth after all of these years So never mind the PE multiple earnings are being temporarily sacrificed for growth Well yes On its approximate billionin LTM sales Amazon did generate billion of gross profit But the great builder behind the curtain in Seattle choose to reinvest billion in sales and marketing billion in general and administrative expense and billion in RD So there wasnt much left for the bottom line and not surprisingly Amazonshuge RD expense alonewas actually nearly three times higher than that ofpharmaceutical giant BristolMyers Squibb But apparentlythats why Bezos boldly bags the big valuation multiples Not so fast we think Is there any evidence that all this madcap investmentin the upperlines of the PL for all these years is showing signs of momentum in cash generation After all sooner or later valuation has to be about free cash flow even if you set aside GAAP accounting income In fact AMZN generated billion in operating cash flow during its most recent LTM period and spent billion on CapEx and other investments So its modest billion of free cash flow implies a multiple of X Needless to say the sell side chorus insists that one doesnt matter either At the drop of a hat Bezos could purportedlyhit the investment pause bottom and unleash a surge of free cash flow The cynic might say good luck on that considering the record But then again he might also ask why was Bezospause button massivelyrerated upwardjust as this bull marketwas reachingits fevered peak That iswe are just completing ayear in which the Fabulous Four FANG stocks Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google gained billion of market cap while the remaining companies in the SP index went down bymore thanonehalf trillion dollars In that context AMZNs market cap one year ago was just billion meaning that it gained a stunning billion or percent during the interim By contrast its free cash flow for the year ended September was billion meaning not only that it grew by a modest amount but that a year ago the socalled market was valuing AMZN at just X free cash flow And to complete the picture during the year ended in December Amazon generated billion of free cash flow meaning that is was then being valued at justX Can you say bubble mania Bezos is surely the greatest empire builder since Genghis Kahn and has never wavered in his determination to spend every dime the company generates in sales Profits be damned But history will surely record that the months since December comprised the final stages of the moststupendous financial bubble in recorded history During that period the casino rerated Amazons meager free cash flow from X to X to X on virtually no improvement in performance It was just plain old multiple inflation gone wild with respect to the last momo stocks standing We have been here before and there is no better analogy than Cisco and its fellowshooting stars in early on the eve of the dotcom crash IndeedAmazons billion valuation is just plain irrational exuberance having one more fling Spasms likethis year billion gain on the AMZN ticker orthe billion gain on theGOOG account are absolutely reminiscent of thefinal days before the tech wreck exactly years ago In a recent post I demonstrated how the Big Cap Techs of led by Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Dell and Ciscosaw their combined valuation soar from billion to trillion inthe months leading upto the March peak and that theythenplunged to just billion a decade later To wittheir bubble era market cap got whackedby trillionin the years ahead even as their sales and earnings continued to grow What got purged was irrational exuberance in a casino high on thecentral banks monetary heroin In this regard Cisco was the poster child last time aroundfor this kind of topofthebubbledisconnect During the month run to March its market cap had exploded from billion to billion or by nearly X By contrast it net income had increased from to billion or by just XAccordingly its PE multiple was rerated during this classic era of irrational exuberance from X to X Even then Cisco was not only the provider of all things for the internet but was actually run by a CEO who had a decent respect for the idea of profits Indeed during the most recent twelve monthsin the spring of CISCO had earned a respectable billion of net income on billion of salesMoreover this most recent net income postinghad grown for eight straightyearsat a spectacular compound rate from million in So its earnings track record was far more impressive and reliably rising than Amazons recent results In fact AMZNs net income peaked at billion way back in and has not comeclose to that high water mark since Still Ciscosproblem at the turn of the century was the markets lunatic valuation at X its smartly growingnet income But heres the thingCisco wasalready amature technologycompanyTherewas no growth rate inthe known universe that would have permitted it to earn into a billion valuation Even at a standard X market multiple on its existing fulsome net margins it would have needed billion of net income on billion of sales to make valuation ends meet In fact during thenext yearsCiscos performance steadily improved but one and onehalfdecades laterit is stillat only onethird of the levels implied by its dotcom eramarket cap That isrevenues have grown from billion to nearly billion and its net income has more than tripled to nearly billion per year Needless to sayits market cap today at billion is just of its dotcom bubble peak In short itsmarket capwas driven to the absurd height recorded in March by the final spasm of a bull market when the puntersjumped on the last momo trains out of the station At the end of theday AMZNs current preposterous billion market cap has nothing to do with the business prospects of Amazonor the considerable entrepreneurial prowess of Jeff Bezos and his army of disrupters It ismore in the nature of financial rigor mortis the finalspasmof the robotraders and thefast money crowd chasing one of the greatestbubbles stillstanding in the casino And yes notwithstanding all the good things it brings to life daily it is not the present day incarnation of even the mightyGeneralElectricof the s and for one blindingly obvious reason It has never made a profit beyond occasional quarterly chump change Not only has its net income been falling for five years but what it has generated in the interim is actually a joke To wit during the last quarters its has posted cumulative sales of nearly billion but only billion of net income and half of that wasin Thats right The Kool Aid drinkers in the casino are betting billion on a massive ecommerce distributor of books and merchandise that has a steady state profit rateat of sales Admittedly in these waning days of the third great central bank enabled bubble of this century GAAP net income is a decidedly quaint concept In the casino itsall about beanstalks which grow to the sky and sellside gobbledygook Heres how oneof Silicon Valleys most unabashedcircus barkers Piper Jaffrays Gene Munster explains it Next Steps For AWS SaaS Applications We believe AWS has an opportunity to move up the cloud stack to applications and leverage its existing base of AWS IaaSPaaS M users AWS dipped its toes into the SaaS pool earlier this year when it expanded its offerings to include an email management program and we believe it will continue to extend its expertise to other offerings We do not believe that this optionality is baked into investors outlook for AWS Instead better try this As indicated above AMZNs operating free cash flowduring its most recent LTM periodwas billion compared to billion way back in So its six year free cash flow growth rate computes to just per annumAnd on that going nowhere track record AMZN is being valued at well like we saidX free cash flow The fact is Amazon is one of the greatest cash burning machines ever invented Itsnet revenuesof just billion in havesince grown by X to billion for the LTM period ending in September meaning that during the lastten and threefourths years ithas booked billion in sales But its cumulative operating free cash flow over that same period was just billion or of its turnover So no Amazon is not a profitmaking enterprise in any meaningful sense of the word and its stock price measures nothing more than the raging speculative juices in the casino In an honest free market real investors would never give a billionvaluation to a business that refuses to make a profit never pays a dividend and is a onepercenter at best in the free cash flow departmentthat is in the very thing that capitalist enterprises are born to produce Indeed the Wall Street brokers explanation for AMZNs billion of bottled air is actually proof positive that the casino has become unhinged For more than two decades Amazon has been promoted as the monster of the Ecommerce midway which it surely is Butthis years billion roll of the dice has absolutely nothing to do with its capacity forsame day delivery of healthy treats for yourpoochThis most recent ripwas all about the purportedly scorching performance of its AWS divisionthat isAmazons totally unrelated business as a vendor of cloud computing services Indeed CNBCrecently gaveair time to one ofthe most rabid analyst on the block and this particular stock peddler from UBS left nothing to the imaginationNever mind whether anything emanating from that serial swindler and confessed criminal organization can be taken seriously heres what the man said AWS is technologys second coming and is worth billion We know that because AMZN has recently been thoughtful enough to break out its financials They show AWS hadsales of billionin the Septemberquarter and revenues of billion on an LTM basis So that puts its cloud computing businessvalue at X sales No sweat Moreover this meansthat the balance of the companythat is its coreEcommerce business is only valued at an apparently much more reasonable billion And by golly said the UBS man thatsjust X sales So whats not to like Well hold it right there Someone forgot to do the math in all the excitement about AWS Yes the companys release did show that AWS posted billion of operating income or about of sales in the during the LTM period But consolidated operating income during the quarter was only billion meaning that by the lights of subtraction Jeff Bezos great empire of Ecommerce earned the microscopic sum of million in operating income during its most recent year By the same magic of subtraction we can see that AMZNs Ecommerce businessgenerated billion of sales This meansthat its operating margin was exactly basis points Thats rightafter years of crushing it on the Ecommerce front Amazons core businessoperating margin is truly a rounding error And might we also ask why you would value at billiontheprofitless sales ofan Ecommerce monster that just cant stopspending every dime it takesinondistribution centers package handlers hireddelivery trucks anddrone prototypes and now apparently same hour delivery service byoutofwork actors and bank tellers who happen to own a Vespa Stated differentlyAMZNs billion market cap gain in was not actuallya rerating it was a baitandswitch operation by the highrollers in the casino Amazon is not the inventor and firstmover of Ecommerce after all Instead its now suddenly held to be themonster of the midway in the totally unrelated business of cloud computing services By the lights of the UBS man andWall Streetsamen chorus AWS is valued atX salesnow But itwill surely crush any competitor in the stretch aheadand therebygrow its way into thatoutsized valuation Except dont tell Google Microsoft Oracle or several others about the beanstalk thingIndeedthe currentnattering about AWSwas truly ridiculous Whywould anyone endowedwith a modicum of sanitybelieve that these tech powerhousesare about to cede the cloud to Amazon merely because it comes first in the alphabet There is no other real reason for thinking so Between them the big three mentioned above have about billion of cash and deep franchises in the world of computing and the internet Sure whentechnologymoved from owned boxes corporate computer centersand software licenses to arentaserver model Amazon got out of the gate first because it had no installed base of old technology to protect But there are no barriers to entry no killer patents no material brand equity no irreproducible sales and service network etcthat will permit Amazon to ringfence the cloudSo there will be viscous competition and prices will fall at a rate which will make Moores law look tepid Indeed Larry Ellison has recentlypromised to cut prices by andhe has rarely failed to follow through on exactly that kind of competitive rampage Likewise it would appear that the cloud is destined to be the future home of Microsofts entire franchise Surely it is probable that AMZNs Seattle neighbor can make the transition from selling computer software to renting cloud services In short AMZN has disclosed almost nothing about AWSs detailed business model its fixed and variable cost structure or theinvestment requirements of its rentable clouds and therates of return on the massive amounts ofcapital employed Only theWall Streetboys girls and robotraders betting on red could come up with billion valuation of a nascent business that is positioned in the crossfire of the Big Tech battlefield So Amazons total billion valuation is just plain irrational exuberance It is also surely the short of a lifetime

hope and greed Amazing how emotion drove the Christmas rally Really no risk reward analysis I mean buying Apple stock at around is going to become in the near future I dont see why people are buying Fri NoWayJose I cannot argue Amazon is overvalued but they are one of the pound gorillas in on line shopping If all they did was sell Amazon products then I would say dead end But they also sell many products for other smaller retailers Like the small business or entrepreneur job creators this is a sign of vitality for Amazon They also stock and process many of these small company products and do have an effective order fulfillment system Will they ever generate profits Not if Bezos keeps dabbling in Kindles Drones hour delivery etc This close to the customer stuff is expensive and must be staffed yearround even when shipments slow It puts Amazon expenses closer to big box retailers rather than relying on the massive warehouseshipping systems that are at Amazons core Fri DeadFred The wife ordered something on AMZN the other day and the delivery doorbell rang two hours later Wow This is a good company for as long as the grid is up and no pound gorillas comes on scene to hose the pound version BUT all that possible future valuation is already priced in so why would you own this stock Keep watch on Amazon and Facebook because the market wont tank while theyre still at the highs They make good canaries for the Ponzi coal mine I ordered in the morning before going to work and when I got home Amazon had delivered it already I thought it was impossible I must had ordered the day before So when I opened my outlookemailsthe order and the delivery confirmation were at the same date Fri pitz Fri besnook you must be young delivery services for immediate delivery to a customer has been around forever but fell out of favor as local small businesses folded and the big box model flourished and the delivery services were relegated to business to business local delivery this is not a new concept but it fits nicely with the local warehouse model amzn uses since they have cut out the big box store format a local delivery service becomes efficient Fri BSHJ The autoparts business has run like that forever Particularly in larger cities parts few true repair parts are not stocked at the retail outlet but at a larger regional warehouse All the retail outlets order as needed and deliveries are usually within a few hours by a eyecandy type delivery person Fri sun tzu Most of the stuff on amazon is now cheaper on ebay and walmart Make sure you shop around before ordering I didnt buy anything from amazon last year because it was all more expensive As for FaceFuck everyone I ask inder the age of has stopped using it They still have an account or five but they log in once or twice a week now They use snapchat tumblr and the other unicorn crap apps Fri i_call_you_my_base Agree with you They may be overvalued but its not a bad business People tend to rag on companies that are overvalued even though they have a reasonable and sustainable model Its much better than the online comapnies that are strictly ad model I wouldnt buy Amazon at current prices but it doesnt mean I wouldnt buy them at any price I wouldnt buy twitter or facebook at any price Fri besnook the tell for me was the reported slower increase in internet sales from to somehow everyone thinks amzn is immune from this slowing growth IT IS RETAIL who cares if it is internet retail it is still retail and dserves a pe of with a little bump for growth Fri J Pancreas WalMarts profit in one quarteris greater than Amazons year end combined I cant wait to see the Bezos fanboys go down in flames Fri Vendetta I was just about to get out my truck at the office and the nuuuz was on yapping about how well Amazon did in Christmas sales in percentile terms ya know like if they had one customer last year and this year they had two they doubledlol and the punchline wasthey had signed up gazzilion premium members for the Christmas shopping season I almost fell down laughing knowing what most safe zone listeners dont know with the offer of Faaarrreee shipping if you sign up for this years online

Halp us gov sugar daddy halp us Fri JustObserving With HFT computers and sufficient money you can manipulate the price of every stock bond or commodity to whatever level you want We are an empire now and when we act we create our own reality It is financial suicide to short corrupt manipulated markets Here is irrefutable mathematical proof that gold and silver are manipulated lower Fri NotApplicable Stockman made the mistake of talking markets in a ZIRPNIRP world making him correct on a number of currently moot points Fri OpenThePodBayDoorHAL People forget that its not just about the numerator its also about the denominator So Amazon share price per dollar really reflects the decline in the value of the denominator in this case relative to the value of the AMZN enterprise The fact that other numeratordenominator comparisons like ZARUSD for example are also way out of whack is throwing people off We are well and truly through the looking glass especially with QE and helicopter money on its way Fri Bear You are right the nominal valuations of the Zimbabwe Stocks went up up up as they currency went down down down Fri Babaloo If I had a dollar for everybody who was carried out in a body bag after shorting AMZN I wouldnt have to short it Fri css Amazon is investing in an enormous amount of hardware to run these clouds The instant the economy turns down its going

expand Smartphones netflix and other web services are needing more and more bandwidth If anything in a economic downturn it will expand as people have less important things to do and turn more to

Dragon HAwk Shhhh Dude be quiet nobody wants to hear the truth in this fantasy land just nod your head and smile at the Emperors New Coat Fri rapetrain Whatever Amazon think its building the world will change before they get there There is too much human ingenuity and capital floating around to keep it bottled up Every empire falls Every technology and logistical network they develop its good

ballbuster Hes close to what Steve Jobs was but smarter and more personable Hes got more money than God and hes putting it to good use Fri Augustus The article is not directing criticism at the AMZN business or services as dellivered The question relates to the market valuation of a Low Profit enterprise The comparisons to the MSFT and CSCO valuations in is appropriate Both continued to improve sales and earningswhile increasing customers and services However valuations had become so distorted that shareholders still suffered CSCO was particularly bad as the company used whatever cash flow was available to repurchase shares to maintain the value of executive options It may be an Old School method but look at the increase in Book Value If the company reports profits and pays no dividends then Book Value should increase If not where did that money go Fri BlueStreet Even more irrational when you consider that of the shit they sell is going to end up in a landfill Fri pitz Mark the whole social media centric tech sector to zero They are entirely and utterly dependant on ad revenue which is likely to dissappear in a postconsumerism debtfuelled consumption world They manufacture nothing They bring almost nothing technologically to the table Even the ones that have earnings severely exxagerate such by stashing their cash in offshore tax havens and earn much of it by merely accepting ads for competitors websites Not to mention being heavy users of guest workers on fraudulently obtained guest worker visas by lying about the availability of US workers Fri Friedrich not Salma Programmers love AWSs development tools Amazons competitors have a lot of catching up to do Google could in theory be displaced in searches right But no company has anywhere near their capabilities
