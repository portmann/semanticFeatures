iPhones iPads and Mac computers I disagree with Mark Hibbens view that Apple might shorten the iPhones redesign cycle to one year In fact I want the company to increase the iPhones redesignreplacement cycle Increasing the iPhones redesign cycle will starve and whet the appetite of the iLoyalists Making the world iPhonehungry is worth a try A longer iPhone refresh cycle will allow Apples retail and carrier partners more time to unload their inventories without them resorting to deep discounts I respect the writing prowess of Mark Hibben However I politely disagree with his view that Apple NASDAQ AAPL might adopt a oneyear redesign cycle for the iPhone After the larger screen display implemented in the iPhone design there really is no compelling new feature that could be added to the iPhone siPhone Making minor improvements under an annual redesign cycle could only worsen the perceived sales decline of the iPhone Worse yet having a oneyear refresh cycle for the iPhone could further expose AAPLs stock price to negative stock market sentiment Its sad but true Apples stock performance is now dependent on iPhone sales reports The company should instead increase the redesign cycle of the iPhone This will allow it to really come up with major compelling updates Prolonging the replacement cycle will make the world iPhonehungry Instead of burdening the world with a oneyear iPhone redesign cycle Apple should try starving the iLoyalists for or years This will whet their appetite for the next iPhone A deprived iLoyalist will be very eager to buy the next new iPhone at any price tag My rejection of a shorter oneyear replacement cycle is also from the point of an Apple customer The high price tags of iPhones makes replacing it yearly an expensive proposition even for business users I even prefer that the company gets rid of the Ssuffixed phone models that are usually released a year after a major iPhone model is launched The lessthanexpected iPhone s sales performance is a strong clue that the world is iPhoneweary The oneyear gap between the release of the iPhone and iPhone s has already proved that a yearly refresh cycle is not effective for the device sales Bloombergs chart below revealed that even affluent Chinese and Taiwanese people have gone iPhoneweary A longer refresh cycle will also help carriers incur less subsidies on iPhones People in America will find it harder to get new iPhones through carriersubsidized Apple smatphones Free iPhones with twoyear contracts from carriers are now getting extinct While some Americans can get new iPhones with low initial cash outlay of under twoyear contracts firms like ATT NYSE T and Verizon NYSE VZ are not happy shelling out subsides for the phones Getting on the good side of wireless carriers is still important to Apples future Dumping new iPhones on global carriers every year can worsen the subsidy issue American or Philippine telcos do not have a guarantee that people who sign up for twoyear contracts will finish their installment payments for iPhones Let The World Satiate Itself on the iPhone For Three Years Apple cannot keep selling the iPhone at its current price tags of under a oneyear refresh cycle People will eventually get fatigued and resentful Resentful because I for one was irritated that my wifes pricey iPhone Plus got superseded by the iPhone s Plus which was released last year My starvetheiLoyalists suggestion is similar to my recommendation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC should skip or cancel its nm Kaby Lake processors After Skylake <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>should wait years before releasing the nm CannonLake processors Canceling or delaying new processors will help Intels partners unload their unsold inventories In the case of Apple purposely delaying new phone models might help its wireless carrier and retail partners find more buyers for their unsold inventories of iPhone siPhone s Plus Releasing no new iPhone models will compel customers to just buy the models that are currently available My idea also exploits a basic psychological truth peoples predictable behavior is that when starved enough they will eat anything Apple can simply release new iPhones every or years The deprived iLoyalists will queue for them again like how ants often line up towards a sweet candy dropped from heaven After the release of the iPhone Apple should try and wait three years before releasing the iPhone This will give enough time to its partners to sell all of their inventories of the iPhone Three years will also let people maximize their usage of the expensive iPhone Plus waiting three years will allow the company to research and develop new features that add compelling value to the iPhone A threeyear refresh cycle will permit Apple to create real innovations or major improvements on its Aseries processors camera screen display and artificial intelligence solutions for smartphones The focus of this article is to create a prolonged pentup demand among Apples loyal customers Yes there is the risk that some of the iLoyalist crowd could defect to Android phones if theres no new iPhone design for three years However a trueblooded fan of the iPhone is more likely to just wait for a new model from Apple Yes a new Android phone could have a faster processor and better GPU than a twoyear old iPhone s However the overall user experience of my old iPhone s is still satisfactory enough for me to not buy the Xiaomi Mi Private XI Apple inspires loyalty because it makes quality phones that are usable for more than three years Its pool of customers can wait for new iPhones because they know it will be worth it Divorcing Itself From Being Too iPhoneFocused A long gap between new iPhone releases also allows Apple to develop its other hardware products The MacBook Pro and the Mac Pro need updated versions The Mac Mini needs an update The Apple TV needs an update it still has no K support The Project Titan project needs to be accelerated Apple is also allegedly interested in coming up with a Siri Speaker to compete with Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Echo smart home assistant The Mac App Store needs serious repair A longer refresh cycle for iPhones will give Tim Cook enough time to notice that Macs are getting outsold by Chromebooks in the K education market The future of Apples new macOS is endangered if most school kids today who will become the worlds next batch of corporate employees are getting indoctrinated with Chrome OS Google Apps and Android apps Apple really needs to increase its refresh cycle for the iPhone so it can allocate more manpower and resources toward improving its other hardwareservices products The companys future growth prospects are in big trouble if iPhone sales continue to contribute more than of Apples annual revenue Let us never forget the lessons learned from the iPad and iPod Touchs decline in sales The iPhone like any other electronic product will eventually fade away into a niche gadget I am strongly in favor of Apple increasing the iPhone refresh cycle The company has no urgent need to match the oneyear refresh cycle of sub Android phones made by Huawei Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY Asustek OTCASUUY or Xiaomi Unlike the solid iLoyalist following of the pricey iPhone Android phones are in a racetothebottom dilemma Android OEMs need to release minor revisions of their flagship phones every year for publicitys sake They do this to retain consumer interest On the other hand releasing a new variation of a iPhone every year might only result in the iOS phone market getting oversaturated and overbearing Longterm Apple investors will appreciate it if Tim Cook can diversify the companys revenue stream Bringing down the iPhones contribution to less than of annual revenue will likely reduce AAPLs stock market vulnerability to lowerthanexpected iPhone sales reports I am now underwater on AAPL I went long the stock when it was trading above I will only dump AAPL again if Tim Cook decides to go for a oneyear iPhone redesign cycle I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology
