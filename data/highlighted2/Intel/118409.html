style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>released its Q report after the market closed Wednesday After estimate revisions were made prior to the released <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>beat on earnings Up until now the titles of my Earnings Reporter articles would generally look like Company A The Earnings Reporter Edition As you can tell by the title of this article Ive changed things up a bit By immediately introducing my opinion on the stock in the articles title I am giving as clear advice as possible My goal in this segment is to unlock both shortterm and longterm growth in stocks that have just reported earnings These stocks are specifically subject to enormous volatility as earnings is seen and rightfully so as a huge aspect of a companys progression What I offer you is an analysis of the economic wellbeing of the company and whether I think the stock is a Buy Hold or Sell for either or both the shortterm or longterm After careful analysis of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQ INTC I have ranked the company as a Buy Well its true The PC market has been all but friendly to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation Earlier this month the International Data Corporation estimated that PC sales for Q totaled million units representing a huge decrease compared to last year A few days later a Seeking Alpha article was published titled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Preparing for Bad News This title represents investor sentiment towards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>over the past few weeks Here is another article from USA Today about the negative expectancy people had towards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Also hurting the multibillion dollar company is that Windows is offered for free on PCs currently running Windows and Windows Rather than storming the stores to buy new PCs equipped with the most recent and supposedly great software consumers will for the most part elect to keep the PC they are currently using This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is missing out on a huge revenue stream as it is the main chip supplier for most PCs Sales are not expected to stay down for too long however IDC analyst Mario Morales had this to say on the impact of Windows Its going to take some time for Windows to really start kicking into the market especially around the enterprise and I think that would really have to happen to drive a really nice uptick in the market With all this clamor about the decline in the PC market investors were steadily united in predicting a poor quarter for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Things have only gotten more unsteady as competitors such as Micron AMD and QLGC have all been reporting weakening metrics Hell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>themselves offered revenue revision to its original middle point estimate The new figure given was billion coupled with a prediction for in Earnings Per Share Furthermore analysts are predicting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to experience a decrease in annual revenue by approximately billion around compared to and to post an EPS of around lower than the EPS figure from Was this negative investor outlook appropriate Was it warranted Well yes The PC market is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generates a majority of its revenue It is an essential revenue stream for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>After much speculation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>finally released its earnings and with the release comes the warm embrace from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>believers In the end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had the revenue it expected all along Corny references aside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>posted the billion figure that was expected earlier on in Yes this is still more than a drop YY but it was expected to be much worse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also surprised with EPS showing a figure of Gross margin even improved basis points from last quarter up to a healthy It is essential to check out how Intels individual business segments performed helping us get a wellrounded idea of Intels current standing To quickly summarize what each of Intels segments entail I will use the definitions given in the Q report Client Computing Group Includes platforms designed for the notebook including Ultrabook devices in systems the desktop including allinones and highend enthusiast PCs tablets and smartphones wireless and wired connectivity products as well as mobile communication components Data Center Group Includes server network and storage platforms designed for enterprise cloud communications infrastructure and technical computing segments Internet of Things Group Includes platforms designed for embedded market segments including retail transportation industrial and buildings and home along with a broad range of other market segments Software and services operating segments Includes software and hardware products for endpoint security network and content security risk and compliance and consumer and mobile security Intels Client Computing Group billion in sales pale in comparison to last years Q but is actually up sequentially Virtually every aspect of the business segment was down compared to This decline was expected in lieu with PC sales tumbling down Tablet success is obviously a positive to take away from the performance but this shouldnt be replicated as the PC market climbs out of its hole Many tablets still lack the complete functionality that comes with PCs A gap is still needed to be bridged Next we go on to the companys Server revenue in the form of the Data Center Group segment This business segment brought home billion for Q This is a increase from last quarter and a increase from Q It brought home over billion in operating income the most from any business segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has stressed the importance of this segment as it is cheaper to operate than its CCG segment and delivers strong sales Unit volumes were up and for QQ and YY respectively In addition average sales price increased by and for QQ and YY performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is generating more volume and obtaining larger payments for its DCG products The Internet of Things Group dubbed IoTC also impressed Revenue for the IoTC segment increased sequentially and YY Total revenue for the segment was million Lastly Intels Software and services segment generated revenue of million flat sequentially and down YY Intels other segment produced million up from This segment includes flash memory and devices Well there you have the segment breakdown Now Ill explain the guidance situation and how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still a great company for shareholders No doubt investors were curious about Intels outlook for both Q and the rest of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offered expectations that seem reasonable and perhaps beatable Revenue is expected to be billion which would be over an sequential increase This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>immediately expects Windows to help bolster revenue significantly My concern is that if they are wrong and overestimate PC sales in relation to the new software release analysts and investors alike will come down hard on the company and rightfully so Margins are also expected to be stronger in Q with a figure currently predicted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is somehow finding ways to cut operating expenses and they should be commended for it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is already upping the ante with higher RD expenses than expected so its a good sign that they are saving elsewhere RD will continue to be around billion especially after other technological breakthroughs are occurring such as the new capabilities for the nm chip that IBM is developing Whether or not the development of nm chips would be a profitable venture at this point is a discussion for another time The point is that other companies are having breakthrough discoveries and it is good to know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does not plan on lessening its RD Revenue for the year is expected to fall about short of last years number This shows two things One is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has come to terms with the fact that they cannot replicate last years revenue they finally altered their flat revenue expectation Second is that this number is much lower than the near decline that many analysts were calling for Margins are expected to come in a a very solid number considering the startup costs for the production of Intels nm chips RD spending for the year is expected to be around billion plus or minus million As I just explained RD spending shows the commitment of Intels management in discovering a new scientific breakthrough and I commend them for it Speaking of management lets look at what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>does for its shareholders After spending billion on stock buybacks in s Q then another million in buybacks in Q it was great to see another large buyback totaling million for this quarter Q for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ended with billion in cashinvestments so they are poised to continue this for the timebeing Also they sport a charming current ratio of showing that they will easily maintain operations and avoid being hindered by current liabilities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>also paid cash dividends totaling billion Intels Q report largely shocked the investment world offering figures well above expectations Skepticism is still properly in the air as the PC market continues its decline but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has demonstrated its capability to thrive in a nasty environment With a solid guidance for the rest of the year and a healthy share buyback and dividend system in place <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>offers a compelling investment Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation Buy After Earnings Disclosure Iwe have no
