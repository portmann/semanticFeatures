style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has announced the purchase of Altera for billion Alteras product portfolio includes ARM chips fabricated on Intels most advanced process <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has indicated that it will allow fabrication of Alteras ARM chips to continue even into the next more advanced fabrication process With the purchase of Altera NASDAQ ALTR <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC officially joins the ranks of ARM chip makers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had already become an ARM foundry by virtue of its foundry arrangement with Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is currently supplying the only ARM system on chip SOC built on Intels most advanced manufacturing process the Altera Stratix series of SOCs Purchasing Altera could be a defensive move intended to head off the threat posed by Stratix or it could be a belated entry into the ARM ecosystem The question of Intels intentions toward Alteras ARM products was clearly uppermost in the minds of analysts at the conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>held to discuss the Altera acquisition Intels slides made no mention of Alteras ARM products and laid out a road map in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture products would be merged with Altera FPGAs in single chip solutions for data center and IoT markets FPGAs Field Programmable Gate Arrays represent an intermediate performance point between the conventional microprocessor and the custom designed ASIC ApplicationSpecific Integrated Circuit FPGAs provide more realtime performance than microprocessors but arent as easy to program On the other hand they can be repurposed unlike the ASIC Device manufacturers often turn to FPGAs when they need performance approaching an ASIC but dont have the market volume to justify investing in an ASIC design Analysts danced around the question of the future of Alteras ARM SOCs a little bit during QA until finally one just asked a direct question which Im paraphrasing Would Alteras SOC be migrated to all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture by the nm node The answer was surprising According to CEO Brian Krzanich Altera would make their own decision about which architecture to use But CFO Stacy Smith chimed in we like our chances That the matter was even decisionable came as a shock I had assumed that this was a defensive move intended to curtail production of the Stratix SOCs which feature a quadcore bit ARM processor Cortex A and which are to be built per the foundry agreement on Intels nm FinFET process Its not clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>understood that it would be building ARM SOCs when the foundry agreement with Altera was announced back in February Especially not very high capability SOCs that might pose a threat to Intels data center business The announcement by Altera of the use of the ARM CPU block in a variant of the Stratix didnt come until the following October If there was any chagrin within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management at the Altera maneuver they were over it by the time of the acquisition announcement Krzanich professed admiration for Alteras strong product portfolio saying that they were products our customers want When asked if the acquisition was defensive he replied that it was not defensive but expansive Analysts also seemed concerned at the high cost of Altera about billion by Intels estimate One pointed out that Altera has had a negative CAGR for the past several years The high price tag certainly suggests defensive aspects to the acquisition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>predicted that the market for combined CPUFPGA SOCs of the Stratix type will grow at a CAGR going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>cited as the reason for this the x performance increase that the combined CPUFPGA Stratix could provide for certain tasks such as facial recognition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must have been impressed by the Stratix and realized that an ARM processor core combined with an FPGA could be a viable competitor in markets such as data centers and IoT Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>would rather see Altera FPGAs combined with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>architecture cores but seem content to allow the horse race between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and ARM to proceed within the ranks of the company Now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>owns both horses the decision must come a little easier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expressed confidence that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture combined with Altera FPGA would be the lowest cost solution Given the recent history of Intels moves into mobile and its contrarevenue subsidies of its tablet sales this is by no means self evident If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>allows Altera to develop a next generation ARM NASDAQ ARMH Cortex A SOC I doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Architecture will be cost competitive at the A performance point This still leaves Intels plan to combine a Xeon core with the Altera FPGA as a viable product however and I expect it to gain traction at the high end of the server market For the Internet of Things Im extremely skeptical of the cost competitiveness of an AtomFPGA solution compared to ARM In this arena the Altera purchase looks very much like an intelligent bet cover by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>The wave of consolidations sweeping the semiconductor industry is indicative of the stress the entire industry is under due to the success of the custom SOC paradigm pioneered by Apple NASDAQ AAPL and now adopted by Samsung OTCSSNLF The market for commodity semiconductors has become a game of musical chairs in which seats at the table are being continuously removed In this context Intels acquisition of Altera appears considerably more adaptive and intelligent than its misguided contrarevenue strategy of last year With Altera <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gains expertise in ARM processor design which it sorely needs to remain relevant In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>gains a customizable product technology that can appeal to a broad spectrum of customers including hyperscale data centers and mobile and IoT device makers From Alteras standpoint the acquisition is a win because it gains better access to the data center market than it might otherwise have had ARM penetration of the data center was always going to be an uphill battle With margins for its datacenter products running fairly high <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could have starved out its ARM competition without resorting to contra revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>now has an opportunity to foster the growth of its ARMbased product line Investors should monitor carefully how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>handles this opportunity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could squander it by fixing the horse race If it does this only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be the loser Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Becomes An ARM Chip Maker
