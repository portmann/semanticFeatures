style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corp this week brought into sharp relief the challenges the onetime PC partners face as they shift more of their emphasis to cloud computing Microsoft has seen strong longterm growth in parts of its cloud business a combination of services and software catering to corporations moving computing functions to remote data centers run by outside providers While revenue for its flagship cloud services business Azure more than doubled last quarter the company said in Thursdays earning report the intelligent cloud division that includes it saw just percent revenue growth in the period And operating profits for the division dropped by percent in part reflecting noncloud products included under its umbrella such as traditional server software Chipmaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a less clear path to growth for its cloud operations and investors have remained skeptical The companys share price is down about percent over the last year as software maker Microsofts stock rose about percent Microsofts market capitalization of around billion is almost three times Intels at billion compared to about double five years ago Wintel computers running Windows on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>chips dominated the personalcomputing era which is slowly ending as more people turn to mobile phones for computing needs and corporations deemphasize desktops Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft run by relatively new CEOs Brian Krzanich and Satya Nadella are betting their businesses on the cloud Graphic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and Microsoft market value here At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in a quarter where the company announced plans to cut jobs as it shifts away from the PC datacenter business revenue rose percent to billion That segment includes the chips powering cloud data centers where the company says it is doing well Theres this perception that Microsoft is more on the cusp and benefiting from this cloud trend said Dan Morgan a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co who holds both companies in his portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is still more drowned out meaning not as highprofile Microsofts bestknown play in the cloud is Azure a set of services for computing and storage as well as tools for software developers Azure is gaining ground on Amazons AWS unit the industry heavyweight in cloud computing services Azure commands about percent of the billion market estimates Synergy Research compared with AWS percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has done well in its category dominating the market for processor chips that are the brains of data center computers but the business faces major pressures Much of the difference in the companies fortunes boils down to Microsofts fundamental business as a software company versus Intels as a hardware company said Nick Sturiale a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners Clients are spending an everlarger part of their technology budget on software according to research firm Gartner And Intels customer base for datacenter chips is consolidating into a few big companies including Facebook Google Amazon and Microsoft itself from a much wider group The cloud vendors are brutal price negotiators and have more power over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said Sturiale Average prices of data center chips fell percent in the last quarter although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>said that reflected the fact that cheaper chips were gaining ground the fastest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could suffer as big datacenter builders like Facebook increasingly design their own datacenter hardware So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has held its own but one day its customers could extend their costcutting to chips In a call this week with analysts Krzanich said Intels top to bottom understanding of the cloudbased data center and keen eye on competitors would help it stay ahead Always paranoid about the competition always driving he said And you know that we live or die by the performance of our product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>makes other promising products including chips for Internetconnected devices known as the Internet of Things If a blockbuster consumer or business product in that market comes along those chips could take off And Microsoft may be overemphasizing how far it has come Much of its intelligent cloud business comprises software for traditional onpremises servers and other businesses with little to do with the cloud A spokeswoman said the segments name is to align to the ambition of building the cloud Microsoft also is good at playing up its cloud business In its January earnings call with investors the term cloud
