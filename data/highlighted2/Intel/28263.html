NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels Q earnings report was the first since combining the PC Client Group and the Mobile Communications Group The operating margin of the combined Client Computing Group dropped substantially compared to the PC Client Group indicating mobile losses are about the same as Intels NASDAQ INTC mobile losses continued unabated into reducing the combined Client Computing Group Revenue by about billion This represents a continuation of the Mobile Computing Groups roughly billionquarter losses of last year since being merged with the PC Client Group to form CCG At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the more things change the more they stay the same By now a number of writers including our own SA contributor Bill Maurer have complained that the reorganization that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>undertook this year amounts to an attempt to conceal the losses of the Mobile Computing Group MCG by merging it with the very profitable PC Client Group If this is the intent of Intels management it hasnt been very effective Its not difficult to back out the loss attributable to the now defunct MCG To do this all one needs is the financial releases from Q and Q In the table below I show historical operating margins for the PC Client Group PCG and the new Client Computing Group CCG Using the Q operating margin as a reasonable and conservative predictor of margin for the Client Computing Group without mobile in Q yields an operating profit of billion on revenue of billion This is a should have been operating profit if MCG losses are excluded Here Ive assumed that contributions to CCGs revenue from mobile devices is negligible which is in keeping with MCG past performance Intels reported actual operating profit for CCG was billion for a delta of billion As a result of the merger with MCG CCGs operating margin has declined dramatically If there were synergies or cost savings from the combined segments they have yet to emerge The merger of PCG and MCG had been long expected since it was discussed at length at Intels Investor Meeting back in November Following the meeting I wrote an article Intels New Mobile Direction in which I argued that the reorganization represented a deeper shift in strategy at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Based on the statements made by CEO Brian Krzanich and others at the meeting there was no embarrassment over the losses of MCG but there was determination to bring those losses to an end My basic takeaway from the meeting was that contra revenue would be wound down in to be replaced by a new emphasis on mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Broadwell devices usually with Windows OS Given the lack of progress in the first quarter I suppose I have to reevaluate my assessment Its still hard for me to believe that any American corporate management could be so obtuse as to think that the elementary subterfuge of a reorganization could work to conceal losses So Im still inclined to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the benefit of the doubt for now and assume that mobile losses will be brought under control rather than merely disguised This was the basic message of the Q earnings conference call held on April A number of factors were cited for this Windows received a lot of attention and its clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>hopes that this will propel sales of ultra mobile PCs with higherend Core processors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>management believes that there are about million PCs in use mostly Windows of course that are fouryearsold or older These constitute a large pool of upgrade candidates that it is hoped Windows will attract I consider this the best hope for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in mobile devices Two other factors were cited as contributing to a target of million in cost savings related specifically to mobile for this year One is the reorganization itself since its observed that there was a great deal of overlap in functions and IP between the PCG and MCG which is undoubtedly true The other factor is the arrival of SoFIA mobile chips which wont be contrarevenue subsidized Since SoFIA is being fabricated outside of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>this year using lower cost but inferior processes Im somewhat skeptical about the traction that SoFIA can get competing against the latest bit ARM chips being fabricated on nm scale nodes by Samsung OTC SSNLF and others such as TSMC NYSE TSM Samsungs Galaxy S features just such a chip and next to it SoFIA is going to seem pretty old and tired Apples NASDAQ AAPL next generation iPhone and iPad also will feature Samsungs nm process and are already bit and competitive with Intels Core M as I recently pointed out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is going to be forced into a race to the bottom with SoFIA and even then there may not be many takers Outside of CCG things are pretty rosy for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is totally dominant in server processors and the Data Center Group enjoyed a healthy yy revenue gain SA contributor Anchorite wrote a thoughtful piece recently about the challenge of future ARM based serve processors I believe that challenge is coming but isnt here yet The progress of many of the smaller ARM chip vendors in bringing competitive server products to market has been glacial but this may be the year that announcements turn into products that can make inroads against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>This will be a long uphill slog however and I dont see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>ceding their leadership position without a fight ARM processors may have more of a chance in the Internet of Things IoT category Something interesting happened to Intels IoT Group this quarter While revenue grew a healthy operating profit declined yy for the quarter Part of this is undoubtedly due to product development but it could also be the result of price cutting in the face of ARM processor competition Because of their low power and low cost ARM processors probably have the advantage for most IoT applications Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>remains one of the premier American technology companies and eminently profitable investors should be concerned about the companys leadership If the reorganization was simply to allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to perpetuate the status quo in mobile of thats a failed strategy and its going to lead to nothing but ruin for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and its investors Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities
