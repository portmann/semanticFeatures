Interested In Buying More <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>But Should I Wait <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is down yeartodate and around in the last year Sentiment is shaky on the stock because of several factors including falling component prices and declining PC sales It looks to me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is inline with historical metrics and I believe actually at the true average of its historical fundamentals I began accumulating shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC at the beginning of the year when the yield was just under and industry sentiment was still balanced I detailed this addition in my Young Investors Portfolio series where you can see that it is currently a very small percentage of my overall portfolio After mid January though there was a decided drop in share price and sentiment based on the outlook of the industry as a whole <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has since dropped around YTD Though I decided to make one purchase more recently to lower my cost basis I have now halted my accumulation and plan to reassess where I want to go with INTC I want to better understand the situation and my strategy going forward before adding more My initial reasons for buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>had much to do with dividend income and long term capital gains in a strong company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>generates billions of dollars in free cash flow and commands an undisputed lead in its industry while providing a decent dividend These were just some of my reasons for beginning a position in the stock However I now need to reassess the situation in order to understand whether I should go all out and bring my position to an even lower cost basis while subsequently upgrading it as far as making it a core holding or continue my halt and wait to see if sentiment and outlook turn around first Lets see if the numbers research and analysis of it all make a case for continuing to accumulate shares of the company Ill start with the metrics of the company and stock to see where they fall in the current numbers game Starting with a PE ratio we see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>trades at a current ratio of This compares to a current PE ratio of for Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and for Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN If the chip industry outlook is not looking as good as it was late last year on several accounts then it seems the market has attributed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the most susceptible To me this makes sense since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is at the epicenter of most of this industry and market As a direct supplier to many OEMs many of which having a market in PC sales these initial metrics account for the market outlook affecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>the most Lets continue to compare some metrics On a price to sales basis INTC stands at while QCOM is and TXN at It seems the gap is a little larger here On a price to book value INTC is shown at where QCOM and TXN at We can see there is a varying degree of what looks to be INTC trading at a discount to these peers I think the most interesting point would be to now look at where these companies traded compared to each other when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was higher in price Lets looks at the historical numbers from the beginning of last December On a price to sales basis INTC traded at while QCOM traded at and TXN at On a price to earnings platform INTC traded at QCOM at TXN at To round out our numbers well finally compare price to book ratio again INTC comes in at QCOM at and TXN at So what are we seeing It seems that Texas Instruments trades at a multiple so much higher compared to the two others consistently in both industry seasons that well look closer at Qualcomm to get a better idea To recap the current multiples QCOM trades at a higher valuation on a PE basis to INTC an even higher valuation on a price to sales basis and on price to book its dead even Now in the previous industry environment PS seems to be about the same as the current margin and book value INTC had a slight premium but very minimally The biggest difference is on earnings where INTC traded at a premium in the previous season where now it is at a discount Overall Im seeing that comparing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>to peers doesnt net us too much in the way of finding a discount or being on sale necessarily The industry outlook has affected all of these companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to have taken the hardest hit to multiples because as I said earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is the most susceptible to this downturn so a peer comparison doesnt net us too much investment analysis ammo its a wash The other angle we can look at is Intels longer term historical averages to see if the current valuation is on par for its history or at a discount To better summarize this I present the following charts to visualize the last several years I used the same three metrics as before It looks to me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is inline with historical metrics and I believe actually at the true average of its historical fundamentals This isnt really helping me decide if accumulation of shares would be at an undervalued point though in order to really load up Lets look at some more tools Chuck Carnevale was one of the first authors I read on Seeking Alpha when I began reading about two years ago After reading many of his articles I became almost addicted to viewing his FAST graphs which gave a really quick and efficient way of viewing a stocks value It became a way of life to view the price and immediately find if it is below or above the line With that said I decided to use this opportunity to integrate my first FAST graph in an article I looked at the last years of information in the graph and used it to get a historical average of its performance If I go back too much further I get a skewed average from the dot com bubble where its PE was extravagant As we can see from the FAST graph <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is currently below its normal PE ratio over the last years as well as the Graham Dodd formula with its growth taken into consideration This graph makes me feel like INTC is at a good point to accumulate and gives me a better idea of its history and trend line However this kind of analysis is only half the picture The other half is the outlook and the companys future I could be buying into the company at a time when its earnings are on the decline and its adaptation to future markets is not being fruitful I am also aware that this is the debated part of the investment theory since some believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is not staying current and its attempts into the future markets such as mobile are at a great expense Others subscribe to the idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is a large player in todays semiconductor market and will be for years to come as it controls many of its markets Of course the Gartner forecast revised its growth estimates downward as they didnt see the growth they expected in the second quarter This was mainly due to weak PC sales and a strong dollar In my opinion though I believe the weakness in PC sales is not a prominent as some would like to believe According to the report production units were down but it also admits a strong dollar has played a role in revenue from this market The strong dollar is something that will ebb and flow with this world economy and isnt something that is permanent Any reversion in this metric would bode better revenue for any US based company not just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>and that could boost future growth and earnings just by that change alone all other things being equal The report continues on to say though that smartphones and solid state drives will drive semiconductor market growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>seems to be on the cutting edge of this after their recent announcement of their D XPoint technology If this is where the growth is and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>produces what it says is a breakthrough then the company and stock could be poised for a bright future This is all well and good but Im still not totally convinced that loading up on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has high conviction for me However there is one more point that seems enticing for me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has a current dividend of per quarter or annually This equates to a current dividend yield of about In my young investor portfolio I detailed how I had a portfolio yield of just over Adding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>here would help my overall yield and allow me to get on the train of dividend growth According to FAST graph calculations INTC sports an annual dividend growth rate of over the last years I do like that Even if I accumulate here and have to wait out a downturn in the industry I would be getting a nice waiting incentive Also keep in mind that Im in this for the long haul as in many many years as long as nothing drastic changes in the industry or within the company itself While Im not a real relier on analyst opinion for topics I feel I can better research individually I do like to see where their opinions lie in order to create a loose guideline It seems analysts are predicting a drop in revenue and earnings for the current year compared to but they expect the drop to be short lived as estimates are for a high single digit growth over this year and a low single digit growth over Price targets vary but the average target is currently Sentiment is clearly mixed among the analyst group but I suppose it could be much worse for the doom and gloom I hear on some of the issues With that said if Im in it for a longer term investment than these short term estimates will only show me what I should be paying for the company Otherwise dividends and years of patience should pay off Currently Im leaning towards continuing to wait or wait until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>shows a better price However if I become too picky in my waiting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>could revert to its fair value multiple that we saw above According to the tool though it shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is indeed undervalued at this time and accumulation would not be terribly risky In Chuck Carnevales world this is a good value Im seeing it as maybe not the best value as INTC has traded much further under its average before I could wait for that to happen again or I could start a slow and steady accumulation with some large buys as the price presents itself Either way I write this in hopes of starting some discussion on this hot button industry and even more hotly debated company in order to understand the long term value found in the company Its possible my decision lies more in the points of discussion than the metrics and fundamentals of the company Disclosure I amwe are long INTC MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
