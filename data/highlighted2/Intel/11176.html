Microsoft Band Is Too Popular Retailers Are Often Out Of Stock Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts Band smart fitness tracker is a hit Continuing short supply of the Microsoft Band is causing inflated prices on eBay and Amazon Nadella made the right decision in making the Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Band available at other online and local retailers However the expanded distribution network will likely exacerbate the lingering shortage of supply of the Microsoft Band On the other hand the short supply also hints that Microsofts smart fitness tracker is a commercial success Launched last October the Microsoft Band was an instant hit among fitnessminded individuals However the scarcity of this product has started since its launch date Even Microsofts own online store is often out of stock WinBeta did say that the Band was available again at Microsofts store yesterday However the delivery date for the Small and Medium size Band will be May and the Large size Band April Microsoft also limits purchases to one Band per customer The continuing shortage has allowed some people to resell their Microsoft Band units at a great markup over the official price tag A check on eBay NASDAQ EBAY revealed that a Microsoft Band could be sold for over The same thing is happening at Amazon NASDAQ AMZN One Amazon vendor is selling a Large Microsoft Band for Microsofts failure to anticipate this overwhelming demand for the Band has allowed scalpers to flourish There is an urgent need for Microsoft to increase production and accelerate delivery while the Apple NASDAQ AAPL Watch is still not shipping out The scarcity of the Band fitness tracker could inspire frustratedimpatient buyers to just order the Apple Watch Sports The Apple product will be available on April so time is of the essence here Its been over four months since the Microsoft Band was launched Microsofts future revenue stream in smartwatches is being derailed by a lingering shortage The Band is more expensive than FitBits Charge HR but Toms Guide rates Microsofts product as the best fitness tracker smartwatch Yes sir the experts see Microsofts Band as a smartwatch in spite of its tiny inch x display Microsoft cannot compete with Apple in smartphones but the Band is a semismartwatch that is a cheaper alternative to the Apple Watch Sports model Unlike the Apple Watch the Band is compatible with iPhones Windows and Android phones The Band is a great example of Nadellas platformagnostic strategy for Microsoft The Band is already capable of running Windows Phone apps and is compatible with Cortana This fitness tracker complements smartphones and it also integrates with the cloudbased Microsoft Health service The data gathered by the Bands sensors could be securely uploaded and shared to medical professionals via HealthVault Fat guys like me can routinely share private health stats to our trusted doctors without us going to their clinics The Band is Microsofts earlybird ticket to the rapidly surging market for smartwatches and wearables Transparency Market Research estimates that the smartwatch industry alone will be worth billion by Transparency predicts that global smartwatch sales will post a CAGR until CCS Insight also predicts that there will be wearable devices in use by of which will be wristband fitness trackers like the Microsoft Band For this year CCS Insight that million wearables will get sold with fitness trackers and smartwatches getting the lion share CCS Insight also estimates there will be million smartwatches that will be sold this year and million fitness trackers Samsung OTC SSNLF was last years leader in smartwatchfitness tracker sales Samsung sold million units of its Gear line of products The Samsung Gear Fit looks similar to the Microsoft Band However the Gear Fit is only compatible with Android or higher devices The Samsung Gear Fit also suffers from poor user reviews Microsofts Band has received star ratings from Amazon shoppers in spite of it being sold higher than its official price tag If Microsoft can kick up production the Band could also deliver annual sales of k units or higher FitBit sold k units of its smartband products last year If we take into account that Microsoft has far bigger resources and distribution network than FitBit or Pebble Microsoft might become the No player in wearables behind Apple and Samsung Microsoft has a great thing going with the Band We can only hope that it could produce enough units to meet the strong demand Otherwise Microsoft will have to license the Bands technology to other companies Making the Band available at Amazon Target NYSE TGT and Best Buy NYSE BBY is counterproductive if the product remains scarce Swiss firm Swatch is allegedly releasing a Windowsfriendly smartwatch I hope Microsoft could land the same luxury Android watch deal that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>NASDAQ INTC inked with TAG Heuer Swatch owns the luxury watch brands Omega Blancpain and Breguet The margins on Swissmade elite smartwatches could be higher than the Apple Watch Edition High retail price tags of Omega smartwatches could give Microsoft very healthy licensing fees Swatch is the fifth biggest vendor of luxury goods on the planet A collaboration between Microsoft and Swatch is highly desirable The affordable Swatch brand could also pave the way for Windows smartwatches for emerging markets The elitist people who could afford a smartwatch will likely prefer an Omegabranded Windows smartwatch over an Apple one Microsoft Health and HealtVault could also benefit when there are more Microsoftlicensed fitness trackers and smartwatches on the market A majority of people today have a sedentary lifestyle A fitness tracker is therefore a necessity product that Microsoft could and should focus on MSFT is a smart Buy Microsoft is a very fit company with top notch fundamentals The longterm technical indicators also support my bullish outlook for
