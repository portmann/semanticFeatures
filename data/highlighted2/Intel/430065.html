Is A Threat To Intels X Market Share Not Vice Versa Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQAMD Seeking Alpha AMDs Zen will address a large share of the X market not currently addressable AMDs Polaris plus Zen will offer unique capabilities not currently available AMDs server market share is zero now but it wont be zero in AMD NASDAQ AMD critics often cite Intels NASDAQ INTC vast technical dominance as a reason why AMD is always on the cusp of dissolution SA Contributor Mark Hibben has been one of those critics and in his most recent article here he claims <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is in a last man standing strategy As part of that strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>must and will drive AMD out of the x market There are several reasons why that wont happen and in this article I will present counter arguments to Hibbens premise One problem with the crush AMD argument is AMDs x desktop business is a very small fraction of Intels sales Thats because currently AMD is only able to compete at the lowest price and margin range of PCs In their latest Q AMD reported million in sales from the Computing and Graphics segment Since AMD does not break out CPU vs GPU we will assume a split or million in x desktop products This compares to Intels billion in sales over the same period It seems to me the pie chart below shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>needs to concentrate on other more promising areas Taking even of AMDs miniscule share of a shrinking market is unlikely to push <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>forward I would think major management efforts will more likely be in growth areas like Data Center IoT D NAND and D Xpoint Market share numbers are provided by cpubenchmarknet every month As you can see from the chart AMDs share is falling and currently resides at about the mark down from in market share But even those harsh numbers are deceptively inaccurate because AMDs share is exclusively lowend lowmargin products That is on a unit share basis they have but on a dollar share basis it is much smaller than that That can be easily seen from the following price tables of the five highestpriced CPUs by company Data for tables is from CDW and New Egg websites If we look at those prices in graph form you can see Zen has a huge potential to capture at least part of Intels current dominant share It is easy to imagine Zen addressing at least of that price range differential That would still leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>in the high end but expand AMDs market considerably And servers are even worse since AMD currently has virtually a zero market share As everyone knows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is so dominant in the server chip market thats basically a monopoly Even the distorted prices shown below dont tell the true story because AMD hardly sells any of these chips So how much market share will Zen servers get next year I dont know but certainly a lot more than zero As VR continues to grow rapidly CAGR to AMDs Polaris GPU scheduled for release June in combination with Zen will provide one of the leading VR GPUCPU combinations in the market I dont see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>out competes AMD in VR any time soon AMD has billion in semicustom deals in house with more possibly on the way Also new game consoles will provide another avenue for increased future sales of x products I wrote about those in this article AMD New PlayStation And Xbox Consoles Should Boost Results Significantly And after the recent Chinese x licensing deal with THATIC look for more licensing deals for x and graphics I wrote about the THATOC deal here AMD The Good News Continues At the latest investors conference AMDs management stated they would be cash flow positive in the second half of With the closing of the NantongFujitsu Joint Venture and the licensing deal with THATIC AMD now has about billion in cash the most since For the fullyear we continue to expect revenue to grow year over year to be nonGAAP operating profitable in the second half of and to generate positive free cash flow from operations for AMDs critics continue to miss the point Polaris and Zen will allow AMD to finally address and capture some of the market share they have lost over the last years They do not need to recapture all of it to have a very successful and profitable company And that doesnt even count the new expansion of semicustom joint ventures and licensing AMD is on a roll but critics dont believe it Mark Hibben is a very smart guy and has had a sell on AMD about as long as I have had a buy on it May the friendly competition continue until one of us is proven wrong I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Semiconductor Broad Line </div></body></html>
