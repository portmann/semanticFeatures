nm production to the second half of Dont expect EUV until nm at the earliest The QA portion of Intels NASDAQ INTC Q results call was full of interesting insights into Skylake SoFIA and the anticipated impact Windows will have on PC sales But I found the insights regarding Intels future direction in regard to process technology to be the most interesting and potentially the most important from the standpoint of a longterm investor TickTockTock Recently it was revealed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>will be inserting a third generation of products dubbed Kaby Lake a second Tock onto its nm node CJ Muse of Evercore ISI asked if this TickTockTock cadence will be a temporary phenomenon to which Brian Krzanich and Stacy Smith both said we are not sure It depends on the maturity of materials and tools when the transition to the next node is pursued nm and EUV Which brings us to EUV In response to a question by the same CJ Muse Krzanich stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is trying to bring EUV technology into the nm node This actually surprised me because of the huge amount of materials and engineering obstacles that must be overcome before EUV is feasible for mass production lithography Perhaps the uncertainty that still surrounds EUV materials and tools is the major reason there is still so much uncertainty about the possibility of another TickTockTock at nm nm and FinFETs Which brings us to the transition to the nm node Krzanich stated prior to the QA portion of the call that the first nm Cannonlake products would launch in the second half of Thus he confirmed what most of us that closely follow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>already suspected that nm production has been pushed out Importantly Krzanich told us that this was due largely to the same challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>faced at nm due to multiple patterning and the like and also stated that this would not materially affect Intels process lead relative to competitors read Samsung OTCSSNLF GF and TSMC NYSE TSM You may be thinking Of course he is going to say that His justification for this assessment is based on his confidence that Intels nm process will have more aggressive scaling then the competitions This seems reasonable given the very different metrics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>has been trying to achieve with each of its shrinks lately compared to others Krzanich also stated that Intels definition of the availability of a node is very different than the definition that others use full production versus product sampling for example Regardless the push out and Perestroika regarding nm is good in my opinion as it suggests that the launch will happen when they say it will happen thus injecting some much needed certainty into the minds of OEMs and investors Remember that Krzanich previously said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>was going to keep specifics regarding timing of future nodes more secret so they dont enable the competition This new openness is a big departure from this prior position Transistor Enhancements In addition to proclaiming Intels scaling and volume production advantage over the competition at nm Krzanich also hinted that Intels nm node will feature certain transistor enhancements a tantalizingly tidbit but materially void of any details to satiate the curiosity of materials science geeks such as myself There has been speculation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>adopting quantum wells IIIV semiconductor materials andor gateallaround transistors at nm Perhaps some of this may come true However during the call Krzanich specifically said in response to a question that nm would be Intels third generation of FinFETs So the gateallaround transistors at nm seems to be off the table Unless Brian considers gateallaround to be just a special variety of FinFETs which it kind of is I guess I wouldnt be surprised if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>tries to aggressively push out some kind of advanced transistor geometry or material as part of nm especially if they hope to transition to EUV at nm It seems unlikely that they would try to do some advanced geometrymaterial and EUV on the same node That seems like a recipe for disaster considering the substantial challenges EUV itself entails D NAND Finally Stacy and Brian had a lot to say about Intels progress in the memory arena First off NAND revenue is up compared to last year Second Brian said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>still expects its D NAND jointly developed with Micron NASDAQ MU to have a performance and cost advantage over the competition due to the architectural decisions they made floating gates versus charge traps I presume Krzanich said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>expects these D NAND products to start ramping in the second half of this year and into next year which is very exciting I cant wait to see how this plays out Krzanich said the performance and cost advantages of the MicronIntel approach should be quite visible in the market In summary it seems that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>is executing fairly well on the process technology side of the business considering the ever increasing difficulty of pushing forward with Moores Law We can expect exciting new structures and materials just maybe not at nm and an increasing importance of D structures in both logic and memory fabrication I continue to be long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Intel </span>Source What Intels Q Call Told Us About nm
