New York Hedge Funds Pour Millions of Dollars into Cuomo-Led Bid to Expand Charter Schools Democracy Now GE Weighs Deeper Cuts to Capital Business Wall Street Journal The Trans-Pacific Partnership and Chinaâ€™s Reality Triple Crisis TPP at the NABE Paul Krugman. Krugman comes out forcefully against the TPP, and is also denying Larry Summers what look to be his efforts to define the left flank of respectable opinion. Krugman, as a trade economist, nixing a soi-disant trade deal, is hard to ignore. Peculiarly, he ignores the sovereignty-underminig investor-state dispute settlement panels, but finds more than enough to dislike in the intellectual property provisions. The Dangers of Intelligence without Creativity or Judgment Ian Welsh. One minor quibble re Larry Summers: even though he is famed for his intelligence, having seen him in action, his reputation rests at least in part on his debating skills (and being a highly dominant personality ). Despite economics’ fetishization of mathematics, it also prizes argumentation (without, as debaters would, giving demerits for tricks like straw manning and ad hominems, which Summers uses routinely). There Are Nearly Six Unemployed Construction Workers for Every Construction Job Opening American Prospect Antidote du jour. Andrea: “Marine birds being beautiful at last week’s big blizzard. Tough little guys but always so elegant, even screeching!” ? Gail Tverberg: The Oil Glut and Low Prices Reflect an Affordability Problem Did Irelandâ€™s 12.5 Percent Corporate Tax Rate Create the Celtic Tiger? ? Ian: “Around about 4 standard deviations IQ starts to go really off tracks without #3 [judgment], because at that IQ level people can make connections between almost anything, the pattern recognition is in overdrive.” Archdruid making resonant points: “Thereâ€™s a common notion that dealing in abstractions is the hallmark of the intellectual, but that puts things almost exactly backwards; itâ€™s the ordinary unreflective person who thinks in abstractions most of the time, while the thinkerâ€™s task is to work back from the abstract category to the raw sensory data on which itâ€™s based. Thatâ€™s what the Impressionists did:  staring at a snowbank as Monet did, until he could see the rainbow play of colors behind the surface impression of featureless white, and then painting the colors into the representation of the snowbank so that the viewer was shaken out of the trance of abstraction (â€œsnowâ€? = â€œwhiteâ€?) and saw the colors tooâ€”first in the painting, and then when looking at actual snow. . . The externalization of the human mind and imagination via the modern mass media has no shortage of problematic features, but the one I want totalk about here is the way that it feeds into the behavior discussed at the beginning of this post: the habit, pervasive in modern industrial societies just now, of responding to serious crises by manipulating abstractions to make them invisible.” When, for credibility and mental comfort you want to put a number on everything (as in, I’ll take Climate Change seriously when you can tell me exactly what percentage of the change in human-induced, how bad it will get, and exactly when it will get that bad) then obfuscating the evidence that does exist and dismissing material reality because you can’t quantify it are neat, soothing tricks. The fact that there is a positive feedback loop for certain kinds of obfuscation (as in poverty isn’t really bad and is the fault of individuals anyway, racism doesn’t exist anymore or if it does then blacks are just as racist as whites so it doesn’t matter, or the wonderful money isn’t the answer to improving education but I send my kid to a $25,000 a year private high school but that has nothing to do with the issue so mentioning it is just an ad hominem attack in bad taste) just makes it inevitable that people with brains and no conscience will opt to take their 30 pieces of silver and muddy the water. When wealth was much more concealed and much less concentrated 50 years ago the temptation to generate verbiage to defend the indefensible was much weaker. Today, with average academic salaries having about the purchasing power they did in 1970 and so many endowed chairs, think tanks, and whole departments riding the gravy train of intellectual whoredom, it’s tougher not to be a shill than it is to be one. Yves arguments is ‘ECONned’ were critical for me in understanding that the cognitive capture in the finance industry is a deeper problem than simple grifters-n-greed. I find that the use of the mean, when talking about average wages (f’instance), is a perspective which consigns most people to the shame-&-guilt of not even being ‘average’, when the median is the robust marker, not subject to the remarkable outliers of the status quo. Steve, I have to disagree with you here.  When the sun is shining on new fallen snow, each flake takes on a different colour (depending, perhaps, on the wave length of the white light hitting the flake).  You can actually see each colour on each individual flake and these vary from yellow, to blue, to green, to red, etc.  If you stare at these flakes, you see the actual colours which make up the white snow.  The colours are REALLY there, not imagined or abstracted.  Try it sometime! No disagreement, Greer is actually saying that ‘snow is white’ is the abstraction, and the glints are the reality. And they are very beautiful. There’s a physical truth there beyond rods and cones, in that the optic neuronal system has already used lateral inhibition to ‘sharpen’ the image before it gets near the brain. The snow’s pretty darn white in the Monet paintings. maybe there’s something wrong with the color calibration on the dude’s computer monitor. sometimes you get weird color shifts when monitors haven’t be properly calibrated, like white comes out looking pink or purple or violet-gray looking, It could be a mistake of electronics. Snow really is white. It really is! If somebody paints it green and red they’re delusional, unless a green and red light is shining on it. In that case, it may not be exactly white. But the sun is yellow, not green and red. It’s only green and red if you have a prism. And then it’s not the sun, it’s the prism. Snow could be red if it’s the evening sun, or the morning sun. But mostly it’s white or yellow. It could be blue, if the sky is very blue. but it’s still a white blue, unless it’s in the shadows of a tree. And then it’s a gray blue. If it’s in the shadows of a tree in the morning or the evening, it could be a gray/blue/red. If there’s a leafy tree nearby, it might be a gray/blue/red/green. But it’s white! There’s no debate about that. LOL. The Passport King Christian Kalin’s business is showing poor countries they have at least one resource worth selling: citizenship Thanks to Kalin, St. Kitts has become the worldâ€™s most popular place to buy a passport, offering citizenship for $250,000 with no requirement that applicants ever set foot on the islandâ€™s sun-kissed shores. Buyers get visa-free travel to 132 countries, limited disclosure of financial information, and no taxes on income or capital gains. Henley is privately held and Kalin wonâ€™t discuss its revenue, but he says by the end of 2014, the firm had helped dozens of governments raise $4 billion in direct investment through citizenship or residency programs. It has also advised thousands of multimillionaires on where and how to buy a passport of convenience, collecting fees and commissions from all sides. Last year, at 42, Kalin became Henleyâ€™s chairman. The business Kalin pioneered has its share of critics, who say it gives the wealthy more room to avoid taxes and provides safe harbor to people who made their money illegally. â€œWeâ€™ve created over the past 50 years an entire shadow financial system that helps people hide money,â€? says Raymond Baker, president of the Washington-based advocacy group Global Financial Integrity. â€œThis is a new wrinkle in that.â€? In June, Bloomberg News reported that Paul Bilzerian, a former Wall Street raider who served two prison terms for fraud, was claiming to be licensed to process citizenship applications for St. Kitts, where he now lives. Bilzerian helped an entrepreneur named Roger Verâ€”a provocateur widely known as Bitcoin Jesusâ€”to purchase citizenship on the island. The two men then launched a website called Passports for Bitcoin to help people in places such as China use virtual currency to skirt local laws limiting money transfers. Learning of this, the St. Kitts citizenship unit made a hasty announcement that it wouldnâ€™t be accepting bitcoins as payment. Bilzerian declined to comment for this story. â€œLike everywhere, in any industry, you have a spectrum of highly professional people all the way down to crooks and idiots,â€? Kalin says. Still, the passport business isnâ€™t quite like any other. It presses moral buttons that most industries donâ€™t. Is it right to turn citizenship into something that can be bought and sold? Thatâ€™s still an open question for most people, and Kalin admits as much. â€œItâ€™s sensitive,â€? he says. â€œIf you havenâ€™t noticed,â€? Chotrani says, â€œthereâ€™s no such thing as home loyalty anymore. You have to protect your assets. Itâ€™s the simplest economic logic.â€? Not to keep you in suspense, Iâ€™m thumbs down. I donâ€™t think the proposal is likely to be the terrible, worker-destroying pact some progressives assert, but it doesnâ€™t look like a good thing either for the world or for the United States, and you have to wonder why the Obama administration, in particular, would consider devoting any political capital to getting this through. Actually, I was glad to see Larry Summers weigh in on the same subject in yesterdayâ€™s FT. Reading that piece, you may wonder what just happened â€“ did Larry come out for the deal or against it? The answer, I think (slide 1), is that he basically supported an idealized TPP that could have been, but came out against the TPP that actually seems to be on the table. And that means that he and I are in a similar place. I am glad Krugman states his opposition to TPP. However, this tepid crtitique coupled with Yves’ astute observation that Krugman apparently has no problem ceding U.S. sovereignty to transnational corporations signifies that we are headed for Classic Krugman: pose some technical objections to what the Democratic president proposes, wait for the minor tweaking (real or imagined), tben declare himself satisfied and come out in support. I don’t trust that man because he is a partisan Democrat first and an economist second. P.S., Re: the investor-state dispute settlement panels, I see the Obama propaganda line is that the U.S. has never lost one of those cases to date so there is nothing to worry about. It would be nice to see a full smackdown of that specious argument by someone with clout, knowledge, and a forum. Hint hint. The argument further tries to claim that the ISDS system is mainly used (and won) against states with fairly poor judicial/legal systems.  How do they explain the Swiss nuke company using an ISDS to rape Germany because they had the audacity to decide to phase out nuclear power?  I’m pretty sure that Germany’s judicial/legal system is world-class, even likely superior to the US (hard to be anything but less corrupt and co-opted than the US judicial system among developed nations).  ISDS is simply a declaration that investors and corporations are entitled to profits  NO MATTER WHAT.  If those profits have to come from captive taxpayers then so be it. Yes, I’m sure the U.S.’s track record in ISDS is an historic anomaly. To begin, past performance does not predict tbe future, especially when the ground is shifting in fundamental ways. Moreover, in its bipartisan servitude to transnational corporations, the American government is now more likely to undercut environmental protections, safety regulations and worker protections than it is to promote those goals. With the neoliberal evisceration of the American regulatory state, we are less likely to be the defendant is these lost-profit-by-national-regulation actions. Since we aren’t regulating any longer we won’t lose ISDS cases based on our regulations. Is that “winning”? And when Big Oil sues a nation for banning fracking the U.S. will undoubtedly side with the frackers, who will likely prevail. So “winning” isn’t necessarily winning at all. Irish Environment dot com article, “The Trojan Horse: Investor State Dispute Settlement in the EU-US Proposed Trade Agreement (TTIP).” Friends of the Earth Europe analyzed 127 cases of ISDS claims under existing trade agreements, outcomes, implications under TTIP. Of 127 cases, 75 involved environmental sectors. Of 127 cases, 28 were successes for investors, 13 settlements, 14 favored the State, 18 unknown outcomes, 21 rejected/discontinued, and 46 cases still pending. Largest award for investors: 553 million pounds against Slovak; largest settlement by State, 2 billion pounds paid by Poland to a Dutch company. “Arbitrators will deliver what the corporations most want – more profits.” You have to wonder? Krugman has to wonder why Obama is pushing this? Is he stupid, or a liar? Or does Krugman simply believe we are all so stupid we can’t see what’s in front of us? He’s expending all this political capital and energy on the TPP and its Euro equivalent because, Dr. Krugman, his paymasters want it! You see, when people pay for your campaigns and your Library and dangle a wonderful 1% lifestyle for you, your wife, and your children after you retire from the Presidency at the age of 55 you tend to play ball with those people and watch out for their interests. Or is that too complicated for your Princeton mentality to grasp? All capitals strive to be showcases, sure, but very few, or perhaps none, is as successful at blocking out its nation’s true ugliness and failures. This sleight of hand, though, also works on many of the residents of this near perfect square inside a near perfect circle. The hell they’ve created keeps seeping in, however, and soon enough, it will overwhelm, if not explode, this Potemkin village of a city. This smug bubble will burst. The IMF is wasting other people’s money (ours) in Ukraine.  The Ukraine is one of the 50% of US-driven illegal coups that fail (to obtain the goals of the US Administration).  The US sought a Western-linked Ukraine where neoliberalism would reign supreme with Monstanto and ConAgra owning the bulk of the rich farmland, the water privatized and in the hands of US corporations (Nestle?), and the oil/gas fields of the eastern Ukraine firmly in the looting hands of Exxon, Shell, etc.  Nope.  It is going to go Russia’s way: a federal system with two fairly independent states, the western portion firmly in the hands of neoliberal austerity and privatization hell, and the eastern portion, independent and aligned more with Russia than the EU.  Too bad, so sad.  No oil/gas for the US, no kicking out of Russian transportation rights to Crimea, no kicking Russia out of Crimea (wouldn’t happen regardless because Crimea is now, de facto, Russian again).  US 0, Russia 1. Coming soon…….Venezuela or Ukraine part 2  If at first you don’t succeed figure out a reason to destabilize another country in the name of “national security” so you can steal it’s resources. It’s got the bonus of not being located next to Russia! On “Open Source Hardware” … so the industry has realized that there is no commercial advantage in board and chassis design and is commoditizing. Common business sense, of course. Pretty much the end of well funded innovation in that stuff. The misdirection is that it is all based on proprietary chips which is where the big money is anyway. It is amusing that they still have a licensing melange. So it’s a good idea but some still can’t really play on this “levelled field” without private holdbacks. <groans> This will save the big buyers some serious money as the manufacturers are forced to compete on a common standard (a guarantee of a price war to the bottom … may the most roboticized win!) We are sold Open Source on its merits of transparency and freedumb. The flip side is obvious here. This is commodification that concentrates profits into a smaller group of proprietary players (the chip vendors) and, by agreement among the likes of HP and friends, attacks the profitability of the others who differentiated on innovative board and packaging designs. We can expect the finished goods vendors (HP, etc.) to pass along a part of the savings and boost profitability … that’s predictable. “The number of seagulls in the Strait of Georgia is down by 50 per cent from the 1980s and University of British Columbia researchers say the decline reflects changes in the availability of marine food.” Isis are not the only ones committing great acts of vandalism > But there are other motives at play as well, and some of them are not far removed from the ideas that animate Isis. That old missionary project, â€œconquering the darknessâ€?, invoking both the biblical struggle between good and evil and the colonial imperative to demonise and destroy the resistance of dark-skinned peoples, enabling settlers to seize their land, their labour and their resources, still drives the destruction of precious wild places. In New Zealand until a few decades ago, people took their families into the countryside at weekends to ringbark trees, killing them for the good of the nation. They believed that they were doing the world a favour by destroying a dark and primitive wilderness. Cultural cleansing and ecological cleansing are driven by the same impulses, in some cases to serve the same ends. KATHMANDU: Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Yubaraj Khatiwada today said international auditing companies should be allowed to conduct external audits of domestic banks and financial institutions (BFIs), indicating the quality of chartered accountants (CAs) here was not up to international standards. â€œIt may cost many times more to hire international auditors … but if you give peanuts, you will only get monkeys,â€? the central bank governor told a conference on financial fraud organised here by National Banking Institute, referring to the adage, which roughly means one cannot expect quality service from low-paid employees. The quality of domestic CAs, who conduct external audits of BFIs, has often been questioned because NRB has detected holes in many balance sheets approved by domestic CAs. Take the case of Grand Bank, for instance. Its capital adequacy ratio, which stood at 12.43 per cent at the end of third quarter of last fiscal year, had slumped to 4.07 per cent by end of that year. At that time, many had expressed disbelief, as such rapid erosion in the ratio â€” which gauges a banking institutionâ€™s strength to absorb shocks and ability to extend loans â€” in such a short period of time was deemed impossible. Since the poor financial health of the bank was made public after entry of a new CEO in the bank, it was suspected that the previous chief executive had deliberately tried to hide the problem. It was also deemed that external auditors had colluded with the previous CEO to sweep the issue under the carpet. â€œIt is true that our CAs lack skill. But because of legal barriers, we cannot hire foreign auditors to conduct audits,â€? Spokesperson at the Office of the Auditor General Babu Ram Gautam said. As per the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal, the regulatory body for auditors, foreign auditors can only extend consultancy service here but cannot conduct audits of banks and financial institutions.â€œI have discussed this issue with the Auditor General,â€? Khatiwada said. ‘Mrs. Clintonâ€™s office added she was following the State Department guidance in delivering printed copies of her emails, rather than an electronic archive. Rep. Chaffetz said he would request the electronic version.’ ‘YEAH, RIGHT.’ Crikey, it’s like reliving the Nineties, now that we’re getting a daily feed of vintage, smoke-blowing effrontery from the Clintons. The essential difference between electronic files and boxes full of paper is that the latter aren’t searchable. It takes a long time to run 55,000 pages through an OCR scanner, and the result is still not quite the same as the original file. If the State Dept. did give such patently absurd, counterproductive guidance to cripple the usefulness of her files, it’s because Clinton staffers issued it at Hillary’s direction. No competent, objective archivist would demand or accept piles of paper when a digital file is available. It’s ludicrous; it’s laughable. But the Clintons expect peeps to just believe their brazen, self-serving whoppers. Her server’s gone but it’s not forgotten Dealing with the Clintons is like dealing with defiant teenagers.  You make rules, trying to be as logical and specific as possible, and they’re off.  Looking for any exploitable nuance or vagary, conjuring up  tortured excuse after tortured excuse, and, when all else fails, whining about how “unfair” you’re being or that you’re just being “mean” and that they “hate” you. And so you spend all of your time and energy chasing after them trying to make sure that they stay on the straight and narrow, and trying to actually legitimize their irrational reasoning so you can convince yourself that they’re really “good” kids who are just “feeling they’re oats” on the way to well-adjusted “maturity.” But sometimes development is just plain arrested. After some three decades of indulgence, the Clintons are still refusing to put their dirty dishes in the dishwasher and have parked their wrinkled 60-year-old asses on the couch and are demanding someone go out and buy them their cigarettes and beer. Sugar, one of the most politicized of commodities,  became one of the first trading rings, starting in 1914 at the CSCE, and even earlier in London. It was also the chief reason for the importation of  slaves into the New World, as harvesting and refining sugar cane is quite labor intensive. Big sugar is woven into the business and political fabric of every producer and user of the sweetener to this day. http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C0CD2D0D-1ED3-4187-87CF-03DA3014A4DF/0/LSS_press_pack.pdf “Colin Prescod, Chair of the Institute of Race Relations and advisor on the gallery  (Museum in Docklands permanent gallery, London, Sugar & Slavery) said: â€œOver some three centuries, transatlantic slavery and the associated â€˜triangle tradeâ€™ generated extraordinary profit, amassed unimaginable wealth, and spawned obscenely inhumane brutalities on a massive scale.” Sugar remains a political hot potato. After Reagan’s election, he provided succor to his supporters in the sugar producing States, LA, FL and HI, by establishing sugar import quotas for all countries exporting sugar to the USA. ( http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=38944 ). The world market for raw sugar then was around 5 cents a pound; after the quotas , US raw sugar (now #16 futures) jumped to 25 to 30 cents per pound, where it remains. (May world sugar #11 last trading around 13.50 cents per pound). This of course hurt many of our Caribbean trading partners, who relied on sugar as a cash export to the US. https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ICE_Sugar_Brochure.pdf “One aspect of the global sugar trade that has remained constant since colonial days is the widespread subsidization of growers,import restrictions and trade blocs. Part of the reason for the longterm downward pressure on real sugar prices has been production subsidies and import protections, whether theyâ€™re American tariffs, European beet subsidies or other factors. The U.S. domestic sugar price represented by the ICE Sugar No. 16 contract often trades 35-50% over the Sugar No. 11 price [both raw cane sugars]. This price disparity, which has been close to 3:1 in the past, has had a profound effect on U.S confectioners, bakers and soft drink manufacturers, many of whom have either left the business or switched to high fructose corn syrup as a sweetener. U.S. trade agreements for sugar include The Caribbean Basin Initiative, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the North American Free Trade Agreement….. Sugar cane is by far the most efficient converter of solar energy into useable plant carbohydrates, at about 8% versus just over 1% for corn. This efficiency derives from a biochemical quirk involving the photosynthetic arrangement of four carbon atoms (instead of three), and allows the sugar cane to pull vast quantities of carbon dioxide out of the air. The ability of the sugar cane plant to capture so much of the sunâ€™s energy makes it the most efficient feedstock for ethanol distillation.” Sugar is half fructose. On a volume basis, it is the most damaging substance consumed by human beings of all time. http://ajcp.ascpjournals.org/content/142/6/741.abstract They point out that 30% of our very large health care expenditures are estimated to be wasteful. (this amounts to about a trillion dollars) (and this by the way doesn’t include private insurance overhead).  This needs to be addressed hand in hand with evolving into a modern era of single payer health care. Blood transfusion was targeted as one of the 5 key overuse measures and so hospitals are trying to address this.  This has been a recognized problem for a long time and gained increased importance when patients became infected with HIV by blood transfusions.  It’s a hard thing to monitor because it not only deals with how anemic the patient is but also his/her clinical condition. Interestingly the electronic medical record can offer a real time ‘best practices alert’ by coordinating these factors when a physician places a blood transfusion order.  They had an overall 24% reduction in transfusion as well as better patient outcomes. These measures have to be used wisely but could also be helpful in other laboratory testing, radiology and therapy such as antibiotics. Medicine is an art as well as a science and there of course has to be room for special cases which are included in these algorithms.  They still had 30% of cases not meeting criteria.  These are good cases for quality assurance review.  It’s good to know if these are appropriate and the standards need to change or if this is just bad practice. The electronic medical record system that presently doesn’t exist? My physician had to email my medical results from the hospital to my ortho doctor because the two hospital systems don’t “communicate.” There is literally no way for HCA to know what Carilion has done or Carilion to know what HCA has done without the patient relaying it to the doctor. Even though I am feeling under the weather I’ve had to essentially carry a truncated version of my medical testing and care back and forth because my specialist is in a separate network from my primary care doctor. After almost 2 months(and hundreds of dollars in co pays with hundreds of dollars in deductibles coming)  I can honestly say I think rather than saying “we have the best medical care” that I feel more comfortable saying that “your medical care is a crap shoot.  Next up, a GI doctor to see how long I can expect my GI tract to be screwed up from being on antibiotics for a month. Never let it be said I don’t learn from my mistakes though, I’ll be using the same network as my primary care doctor( who gets the dubious honor of deciding what to do with the fact that my B/P has shot through the roof thanks to my hand.) WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) – The International Monetary Fund is so far not concerned about the euro’s weakness. In a briefing for reporters, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said that recent moves in the European currency were “in line with fundamentals.” That’s like Jeffrey Dahmer saying he’s ‘not concerned about cannibalism.’ Always and everywhere, the IMF’s recipe for troubled borrowers has been devaluation. Except for Greece. There, the prerogatives of the EU (which groomed the IMF’s leadership) supersede what’s best for the borrower. But euro devaluation does provide some incremental help for Greece, at least in relation to its non-eurozone trade. in unrelated news, wall street prepares for record bonuses So has Israel finally jumped the shark?  Reading a few pages of comment in the WP, Israel is called out over and over.  You wouldn’t have seen that on the WP 10 years ago…probably not even two years ago.  So when will Israel jump the shark with the powers that be? walsh’s ideas on intelligence in economists reminded me of Kurt Hammerstein’s theories on intelligence in generals (do read Hans Magnus Enzensberger’s marvelous ‘The Silences of Hammerstein’). Hammerstein, top general in the german army between the wars, divided army personnel into combinations of four categories: smart, stupid, diligent, lazy: the smart and diligent make up the best staff underlings; stupid and lazy make up the grunts; smart but lazy gives you the best general (they who are free to think deeply); those stupid but diligent are the most dangerous. seems in summers’ case it is the diligence–more precisely, ambition–that clouds the intelligence, making him suspect, if not to say dangerous. de long, as walsh says, has no judgment (e.g., previous worship of greenspan), which in my mind makes him not intelligent at all. It’s also a problem between a huge country and a small country.  I can’t imagine what damage a lot of money rushing in and rushing out of a small country, Monaco, for example, who is not an emerging economy, I think, from another one, say, 50 times or more its size, China perhaps, will do. Maybe not in the 1950’s.  But today, China has a lot of US dollars to do a lot of rushing in and out. Another reason for foreign real estate buying in, say Southern California, is, I believe, the need for maternity motel rooms. With the reported fees they charge for those would-be mothers of future Americans, they can afford all-cash deals, not just for apartments, but also for single family homes (not raided in the last Fed sweep, I think)….here, Greed dictates they put 10 or more pregnant women in a, say, 4 bedroom house….you make more money that way.  I don’t know if that’s what they are doing, but a ‘smart’ operator would do that. As a bonus, I believe some were, a few years ago, pushing for giving out green cards for real estate buyers;  thus, these operators can get permanent residency for themselves as well. The earth drifting into a chilly part of the galaxy seems plausible to me. I wonder how they measure temperature in outer space. I don’t think they directly measure it, with thermometers, so they must model it somehow. Maybe it decreases with the square of the distance from  the sun and other stars. Then they do a cluster analysis of star density within radii of increasing parsecs in magnitude modulated by star type and size, which would be related to heat output. Then they interpolate the modeled findings into a termperature-space that bears a 1-1 relationship with some conception of spatial geometry, sort of a 3D map of galactic volume. That would do it. That must mean the earth floated into a region of space with a low star cluster density reading. It occurred to me this might be related to Bruce Jenner’s sex change operation. Anybody could be wandering around and collide with a disembodied spirit who takes over their mind. If the spirit is a female spirit, it could explain why somebody would want a sex change. Just wandering around, that’s kind of scary. God knows what you’ll run into and you won’t even know it. I wonder if that’s what happens. We  might usefully invent a disembodied spirit detector, just so you know what to watch out for.
