ETF Hub Mar. 10, 2015  2:10 PM ET  |  About: Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (RAX) , Includes: AMZN , GOOG , GOOGL , IBM , MSFT by: Brian Nichols In the past, I have looked at both sides of the trade on RAX, having followed the company closely for several years. Two trends that have not changed: RAX has decelerating growth in the cloud and operates in a near-mature web hosting business. One of the greatest things an investor can do is to continuously challenge their own analysis, to form an opinion, but be ready to change that opinion when needed. Perhaps my greatest recent example is with Rackspace (NYSE: RAX ), a stock I consistently said to short in 2013 and early 2014, but in late 2014, finally acknowledged that it might have a place in the public cloud industry ( You can read all about it here ). Yet, just because Rackspace may survive in a highly-competitive cloud services environment doesn't make it a great investment, especially right now. While Pacific Crest and Cowen were hiking their price targets on Rackspace following its fourth-quarter earnings , I was taking notice of how revenue growth in its public cloud business decelerated for the fourth consecutive period, and that its Dedicated cloud (Web hosting) business continues to approach maturity. In essence, my observations are not opinions, but rather backed by the company's own fundamental performance, as seen below. Albeit, Rackspace has never been a company whose public cloud revenue has grown at the rate of cloud infrastructure services leaders Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ) or Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). As acknowledged in my linked article above, its more conservative growth doesn't mean there isn't a place for Rackspace's services among high-end customers who are willing to pay higher prices for more perks. The problem is that Rackspace's public cloud segment's growth continues to decelerate whereas cloud infrastructure as a service and platform as a service segments maintain a growth rate near 50% year over year. The company should therefore be able to at least keep revenue growth consistent with previous quarters, rather than continuously decelerating. Furthermore, most analysts and investors who follow Rackspace know that its Dedicated cloud segment's days of low double-digit growth are numbered, which was evident in its most recent quarter. This is an older business that should soon find itself growing at a mid- to low-single digit clip. Therein lies the problem. Rackspace has two core segments, one of which has rapidly decelerating year-over-year growth and the other that's reaching maturity. And just to be clear, Rackspace's presence in public cloud is conservative at best, creating quarterly revenue of less than $150 million while industry leader Amazon.com is figured to earn well over $1 billion in quarterly revenue from its cloud services. In other words, the company's decelerated growth in public cloud is not due to its size, or the natural deceleration of growth that occurs in larger businesses. It is, instead, a result of a limited appeal to customers within the cloud services industry. Given these facts, I disagree with Cowen calling for shares to surge 50% (price target $75) when it now trades at a multiple of 66x trailing 12-month free cash at $51 a share. At such a multiple, Rackspace is trading as one of the premier growth tech companies in the market, not as a company that's growing total revenue 15% and has seen its trailing 12-month operating margin decline 30% over the last two years. The bottom line is that Rackspace is far from a company that's deserving of such a multiple. Certainly, there is a place for Rackspace in public cloud, but there is also legitimate risks that its growth will decelerate further, and that sooner or later it'll be forced to lower service prices in the cloud, thereby pressuring margins even more. In my opinion, shares would be more fairly priced around 40x free cash flow, not in excess of 65x. In my previous article, I actually said that shares could retest all-time highs near $80. After taking a closer look, the deceleration of revenue growth in the cloud and the maturity of web hostings are too real of threats to support such a valuation. Therefore, Rackspace may be a decent company, but it's a stock with limited to zero short-term value and very little long-term value as well. Source: It's Time To Turn Bearish On Rackspace, Again!
