Until Rare Earth Prices Rebound, Molycorp Is Dead Money - Molycorp, Inc. (NYSE:MCP) | Seeking Alpha As Molycorp continues to rightsize its operations, investors have focused on how much it can reduce production costs. From Q3 2012 to Q3 2014 the company's average sales price has declined by over 40%. Molycorp (NYSE: MCP ) has been in restructuring mode for years now. It recently broke the buck after entering a $38 million debt-for-equity swap ; the transaction caused investors to question the company's turnaround efforts. Most of the focus has been on Molycorp's cost of production - one of the few things it can control. I estimated the company needed to cut production costs by about $22/kg just to break-even. The following chart illustrates the company's volume and average sales price ("asp") for the most recent quarter: Despite efforts to lower its production costs through it Mountain Pass expansion, rare earth prices must rebound for the company to be viable long-term. Due to increased supply in China and new entrants into the rare earth space, rare earth prices have been in decline since the second half of 2012. The following chart illustrates Molycorp's average sales price ("asp") by segment: The company's weighted asp has declined from $47/kg in Q3 2012 to $28/kg in Q3 2014. The hardest hit segments have been Resources and Chemicals & Oxides whose asp have nearly been halved over the review period. Molycorp's weighted-average asp has declined 40% from Q3 2012 to Q3 2014. Regardless of how investors feel about management or the delay in the Mountain Pass expansion, not many companies could survive with the decline in asp Molycorp has experienced. The Magnetic Materials segment has held up the best with only a 17% decline over the review period. The price stability was helped by the fact its Neo product has been patent protected; however, those patents expired this past summer. Neo powders and bonded magnets are used primarily in motors and sensors for computer and office equipment, consumer electronics, and automotive and industrial applications. The pink elephant in the room is when or if rare earth prices will rise. At these levels, Molycorp may not have a viable business model regardless of how efficient it is on production costs.
