What Could Replace PIMCO High Income Fund? - Pimco Income Strategy Fund II (NYSE:PFN) | Seeking Alpha PHK is trading at around a 60% premium to NAV. Although the fund has performed well over time, that's an extreme premium. PIMCO High Income Fund (NYSE: PHK ) is a contentious closed-end fund, or CEF. Investors who own it seem to love it with a vengeance. Those who don't look at the roughly 60% premium above net asset value, or NAV, and think, "way too expensive." When I wrote about the fund recently, one commentator asked what I'd recommend to replace PHK. How about PIMCO Income Strategy Fund II (NYSE: PFN )? First off I want to say that PHK's performance on an NAV basis has been really good. According to Morningstar, PHK's one-, three-, five-, and 10-year trailing total returns through February all handily trounced its multi-sector bond peer group. (Note that these figures include the reinvestment of distributions.) And that outperformance was often by wide margins. Managers Alfred Murata and Mohit Mittal have done a good job with the fund. If this were an open-end mutual fund, money would be pouring in the door. Now you could argue that a huge influx of new money might make it harder for the fund to achieve such impressive results, which is a legitimate concern. But PHK isn't an open-end fund, it's a closed-end fund. And that sets in motion some interesting things. CEFs trade on supply and demand based on a limited number of shares in the market. If a fund is doing well, it makes sense that investors would want in. More demand will lead to higher prices. Normally that means a narrow discount or slight premium. However, in the case of PHK the demand has been so strong that it's trading at a massive premium. Make no mistake, 60% is extreme . I've used this example in the past, but here it is again. Would you pay 60% more for a car than list? The Toyota (NYSE: TM ) Prius shows that people will, in fact, do that. At least for a period of time. No one would overpay for a Prius today. Now there's new supply in the Prius example, so it's not a clean comparison. And one commenter noted that if a race car driver were at the wheel the Prius would be worth more than if an Earth-conscious soccer mom/dad were at the wheel. (Which is both an interesting comment and really funny.) But my basic idea is that by purchasing shares in PHK you are willingly overpaying for the assets you are buying. That may be fine with you, but you should also make sure you understand that risk. If investors lose faith in PHK, there's a huge downside before it's trading at the value of the assets it owns. Although performance is a big draw at PHK, the 10%+ dividend yield is another. And on that score, finding a double digit yield in bonds, particularly with interest rates at low levels, is hard to do. So, when asked about an alternative to PHK, I really don't have a great answer. Whatever I suggest is going to be risky. That said, right now you might consider PIMCO Income Strategy Fund II. PFN is run by the same managers that run PHK (essentially the same race car drivers that make PHK so much more "valuable" than your run of the mill Toyota Prius... Wait, I mean CEF). That really doesn't make it good or bad, but if the abilities of these two PIMCO managers is so prized at one fund it only makes sense that they bring at least some of that skill to their other funds. And PFN's yield is in the 10% range, too. Better yet, it's trading at just about NAV versus a history of trading at a slight premium. The big difference between the two funds, however, is that PHK and PFN do different things. PHK is essentially a leveraged high-yield bond fund (though it can pretty much invest in any way the managers want). PFN is basically a leveraged floating rate loan fund (though it can invest in fixed rate instruments, too). Floating rate loans are relatively short-term loans made to companies that can't or choose not to access the bond market. These loans generally come with higher yields that are pegged to the market's prevailing interest rate plus some percentage. Loan rates usually adjust up and down at some specified interval so they remain in line with the market's rate. Although the short-term nature of these loans and the peg to changing interest rates makes them somewhat less sensitive to interest rate changes than other debt instruments, they are more akin to high-yield bonds than anything else. This is because companies usually take these loans out for good reason-it would be more expensive to issue bonds because they are too small, too young, or too financially constrained to get low rates. Credit risk, then, is the big issue-just like with the high yield bonds PHK owns. That said, PFN's performance record isn't as good as PHK's record. But it is relatively good compared to similar funds. For example, it has handily outperformed iShares Floating Rate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA: FLOT ) over the trailing 1- and 3-year periods. (PFN has a longer history, but FLOT doesn't.) So the managers appear to be doing a good job here, too. PFN isn't a risk-free investment option. But it also isn't trading at a huge premium. And if you are concerned with interest rates rising, the assets in which it invests are protected, to some degree. And you'll get that 10% or so yield. If you are worried about PHK's premium but are hesitant to give up the dividends, PFN should interest you. You clearly need to make the decision for yourself. However, the race car drivers are the same, the yield is pretty close, and the price is much cheaper relative to NAV. If you own PHK you should at least consider alternatives and PFN is definitely one that you should look at. Even if you don't make the switch, the effort to review an alternative would be worth the effort. Source: What Could Replace PIMCO High Income Fund?
