The Case For USD-INR Carry Trade | Seeking Alpha USD-INR carry trade has been yielding favourable returns, even after bearing forward premium. Interest rates in India are expected to go down, while US rates might go up. India's interest rates have started to come off their 5-year highs recently, with India's central bank cutting policy rates by 25bps after a long pause. On the contrary, the rates in the US are expected to go up by the end of the current year. The huge differences in interest rates had made the Indian Rupee ((NYSEARCA: INR )), a favourable currency for carry trade. In Feb 2015, the MIBOR rates (Mumbai Inter Bank Offer Rate) averaged 8.6%, while LIBOR averaged just 0.26%. Source: Reserve Bank of India , St.Louis Fed But the adverse current account position and vulnerability to foreign portfolio outflows made INR very volatile, especially during the second half of 2013 - called 'taper tantrum'. But a series of measures by the Reserve Bank of India stabilised the Rupee, which has stabilised around INR 61-63 to the US dollar. High volatility in the Rupee made carry trade investors vary of investing in the Rupee. On the other hand, higher interest rates and volatility in the INR pushed up the forward premium, with the forward rates inching close to 10% during late 2013. This made a hedged carry trade costlier. We examined the interest rate differences between USD LIBOR and India's inter-bank rates for the past 6 years, along with movements in forward premium. Our study shows that, INR still remains an attractive carry trade currency, even after bearing the forward premium. Carry trade on a 3-month exposure could earn a return of 0.6% (annualised), which is roughly 2.5 times the USD LIBOR. Rates in the chart have been annualised. Source: Reserve Bank of India, St.Louis Fed While we see hedged USD-INR carry trade as profitable, with INR currently ruling at 61.8 per USD (which is ~5% stronger than our 2015-end target of 65/USD), we believe that unhedged carry trade could provide ~3% returns. Investors with higher risk appetite can consider keeping their carry trade positions open.
