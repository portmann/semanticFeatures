While bond yields in the United States are attractive, a possibility of higher interest rates in the coming year poses interest rate risk. With Canada and the United Kingdom showing modestly better GDP growth than Europe coupled with lower deflation risk, bond yields in these countries look attractive. With increased incidences of quantitative easing measures set by the European Central Bank, bond yields in Europe have hit a new low of 0.1980 percent. In an attempt to bolster GDP growth in the eurozone, a lowering of interest rates has been the main weapon of choice for the ECB, but price expectations do not appear to be well managed, leading to a higher incidence of deflation across several European countries. Additionally, the dynamic of investing in government bonds in Europe has changed in the past five-year period. From 2010-2012, with high budget deficits and low economic growth across peripheral countries such as Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, such countries typically offered higher bond yields in an effort to raise funds. With the exception of Greece, which continues to offer a bond yield of approximately 10 percent, yields in peripheral and core European countries alike have continued to decrease: In this regard, bond yields in Europe and Japan have increasingly deviated from that of Canada, United Kingdom, and the United States, which are offering bond yields of approximately 1.5 to 2 percent. In all three countries, GDP growth as a whole is higher than that of the eurozone and risks of deflation are much less. However, of these three countries it is most likely that the United States will proceed to increase interest rates sooner rather than later, with the Federal Reserve indicating that a rate rise can be expected near the end of 2015 and will be decided on a "meeting-by-meeting" basis. While as a whole a rise in interest rates will likely act as a positive signal to US stock markets, since a slow but steady rise in rates coupled with increased GDP growth will allow for better management of price expectations, this poses a degree of interest rate risk for bondholders as yields will fall in response to a rise in rates. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the United States grew GDP at a rate of 2%, which is significantly higher than Canada, eurozone, and United Kingdom at rates of 0.6%, 0.3% and 0.5% respectively. Given that Canada and the United Kingdom have only modestly higher rates of growth than that of the euro area, central banks in these countries will not be as keen as the United States to raise rates any time soon, posing less interest rate risk to bondholders. However, I expect bond yields in these countries will maintain a level of 1.5 to 2 percent as deflationary risks in Europe mean German bonds risk losing their status as "safe haven" bonds, and Canada and the United Kingdom are in a better position to grow GDP at a higher pace while keeping interest rates low for the time being. In conclusion, with European and Japanese bond rates at a record lows, such countries no longer offer satisfactorily high yields to compensate for increased risk. Additionally, even perceived safer bonds such as that of Germany do not look to be so any longer given low economic growth and deflation risks in Europe. In this regard, Canada and the United Kingdom offer comparatively attractive bond yields with a lower level of interest rate risk than that of the United States.
