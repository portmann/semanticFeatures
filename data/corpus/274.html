ReWalk Robotics Has Been One Painful Science Experiment For Investors - ReWalk Robotics (NASDAQ:RWLK) | Seeking Alpha RWLK is showing incremental increases in sales but at nowhere near a fast-enough rate to reach cash flow breakeven. As it draws its C&CE balance lower and lower, I believe its market cap will track lower and lower. ReWalk Robotics' (NASDAQ: RWLK ) science experiment using public market monies is about to get painful, yes even more painful than it already has been, for RWLK longs. Shares are down ~47% since days after RWLK's IPO: First, RWLK just reported its full-year results which were impressive from a Y/Y comparison standpoint but are nowhere near anything resembling breakeven from a cash flow standpoint. I'll explain that further within a summary of the results (SOURCE: RWLK Q4 PR ): "We placed 31 ReWalk systems globally during Q4 and 74 systems total during 2014, up substantially from the six systems placed during Q4 last year and 25 systems in all of 2013." This is a big deal and this is substantial growth. At $60,000 per unit the revenues from units can really add up. That's assuming units sold increase exponentially, which is going to take time and much more money invested. Those are two assets that RWLK currently has but that it's burning with each day. I'll explain this further: RWLK has ~$44 million in C&CE with another ~$4 million in AR and inventory. That comprises its asset base. With each quarter on the books of not breaking even from a cash flow standpoint we know C&CE is going to fall. As the company scales up, and with that scales up expenses, we know that cash is going to burn faster. Also, RWLK still has to maintain an inventory balance to continue to seed markets. As it wants to do this faster and in greater depth, we know that cash is going to burn faster. The point I'm trying to make isn't a ground breaking one but it is important - RWLK's cash run rate should accelerate greatly into 2015. Only, don't ask management about it like an analyst did on the Q4 call because management will simply say "we're not giving guidance at this point". Pretty convenient. Now, what was that run rate in 2014? RWLK burned ~$15 million in 2014 from operations and another ~$2 million in investments. That brings the total all-in run rate to ~$17 million. With management guiding increased R&D and increased G&A as it scales up its international operations, I could see this run rate reaching maybe as high as ~$25 million. Management was very clear that R&D was moving higher in a big way on the call, that's a large part of my uptick to cash burn. So, at $25 million next year for a full-year run rate that would have C&CE down to we'll say ~$16 million. I'll give RWLK a few million in credits for AR and inventory, say $4 million all-in, which would give the company ~$20 million in assets. Currently the company trades at around $200 million with a rounded $50 million in assets. What do you think it'll trade at with less than half that? My guess is somewhere around ~$80 million. The idea that the market is valuing RWLK or its cohort Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. ( OTCQB:EKSO ) on sales or any other traditional metric is a fantastic one, a real fantastical fantasy. At this point the only metric I've found covering either name with any correlation to market cap is C&CE balance. This of course gets skewed, the correlation, as the company gets more and more dilutive but for now RWLK should trade in line with cash. Go ahead and data plot RWLK's cash to its share price and tell me if you see some irregularities in trend-line. You won't. It correlates. So, as cash dwindles so will market cap. Do you really want to be long this science experiment that is years away from cash flow breakeven? The bottom line is that RWLK shares are a sure thing to move lower. It can't magically ramp up sales because it doesn't have the reimbursement approvals in place to facilitate that and the private markets have had the FDA approved technology for quite some time now and haven't shown a willingness to pay privately. There is no short-term upside case here folks. Just put your helmet on if you're long this stock and look out below. Revenue was up 283% to $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $400,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013 with higher sales and placements of ReWalk systems. Total revenue for the full year grew to $4 million compared with $1.6 million in 2013. See above. Expenses still outpaced revenue growth and should continue to do so well into the future. Of the total units placed since FDA clearance, more than half were placed for personal use with the remaining balance to be used in rehabilitation centers around the world to continue to grow this market. Net loss was $5.5 million for the fourth quarter and $21.7 million for the full-year 2014. This compares to a net loss of $3.5 million in the fourth-quarter and $12.2 million in the full-year 2013. Don't confuse this with cash loss which was much less in total and matters much more than the GAAP net loss. As of December 31st, 2014, our balance sheet remained strong, with $43.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits and no debt. I think that the analysts on the Q4 call who asked for and were denied revenue, net loss, gross margin, pricing, and cash burn guidance have to downgrade what are currently pretty optimistic targets: With these downgrades to price targets I also think the lone BUY reco has to move to a HOLD or a SELL based on near-term balance sheet weakness visibility. Actually, they all should move to SELL. I've had a HOLD or SELL rating on this name since late-September at $28/share, and it's done my readers well. Continue to avoid RWLK on all durations.
