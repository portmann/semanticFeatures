Lumber Liquidators: Worrying About The 2015 Forecast - Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha There's been a lot of focus on Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL ) in recent weeks. Shares have been hammered thanks to a bad earnings report and a negative piece on 60 Minutes regarding the safety of flooring products. The company is expected to provide a key update on Thursday to cover a variety of issues, and investors will certainly be eager to hear what management has to say. Today, I want to focus on the key financial aspect of this update, and I'm not here to discuss the flooring issue, which can be read about extensively here . As part of the 10am Thursday conference call, the company will provide an update on its business, including a first quarter 2015 outlook. I believe that the company's guidance is very key to which way this stock will head next, as it likely provide some clues as to how consumers are looking at the company. When the company announced its most recent quarterly results , we were given the following details on the current quarter. I've condensed this forecast a bit to highlight the key points. Open orders increased 24.5% over the same day in the prior year. Company expected percentage increases over 2014 to moderate over the remainder of Q1. Q1 comparable store net sales to increase in mid to high single digits. As of Wednesday, analysts were looking for $275.89 million in revenues, an increase of 12.1% over the prior year period. On the bottom line, EPS were forecast to come in at $0.44, down a nickel from last year's period. The company announced strong growth through Feb. 23, but you have to wonder how the rest of the quarter will play out. Thursday's update will provide some key clues. Based on this data, we probably will be able to project some things about the rest of the year. The company guided to $1.14 billion to $1.21 billion in revenues for 2015, and analysts are currently at $1.16 billion. If the company is seeing sales troubles due to the flooring controversy, I would hope that management takes down the 2015 forecast. You might also see a rise in operating expenses because the company will have to increase its marketing expenses to negate some of this bad press. Analysts are currently looking for $2.63 in EPS this year, towards the bottom end of the company's $2.50 to $3.00 forecast. The company has not done well on the bottom line recently, as seen in the table from the estimates page linked above. I'm also curious to hear how the company's gross margins are doing at this point, because weak sales usually forces a company to discount its products. As seen in the recent 10-K filing , the company ended 2014 with more than $314 million in merchandise inventory, up nearly $62 million (24.54%) from the end of 2013. Having weak sales with a lot of excess inventory could be a recipe for disaster. In the end, I'm very curious to hear the company's business update for Q1 and perhaps the rest of 2015 on Thursday. Setting the flooring issue aside, I want to know if the recent press has resulted in any sales weakness. Analysts are below the company's midpoints for sales and EPS, and those numbers could drop if Lumber Liquidators reduces its forecast. Ending 2014 with a lot of inventory probably will not help the situation. Shares have bounced about 20% from their 52-week low, providing a short opportunity for those that believe Thursday's announcement will disappoint.
