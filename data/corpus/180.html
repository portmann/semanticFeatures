Is Starbucks Done Growing? - Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 11, 2015  1:01 AM ET  |  About: Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) by: Young Money Monsters Over the past 5 years, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) has appreciated over 280%. With these immense gains, investors have to wonder if the company has much left in the tank for the years to come. Statistically, earnings per share are projected to rise 16% to 18% in FY 2015, along with 13% global revenue growth and 5% global comp sales growth in the Q1 of FY 2015. This projected growth helps justify Starbucks's current P/E Ratio of 28. Investors have to wonder where this growth is coming from and if it is sustainable. Starbucks lists its first layer of growth as "[being] the employer of choice" through "industry-leading wages" and "generous benefits". While other companies such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) are just now realizing the importance of treating employees right , Starbucks has been a leader that continues to value its employees. These employees are key to the aura of a Starbucks that so many enjoy. Internationally, expansion into China has been an immense success. Starbucks adjusted its menu to Chinese taste (eg., green tea) and the population has responded strongly. Carrying a Starbucks cup around is seen as being a part of the middle class, an image many strive for. Starbucks aims to have 1,500 stores in China by the year's end. The company continues to satisfy current customers as well. 33% of transactions are on Starbucks cards, and the Rewards program currently has 9 million active users. Starbucks also has a focus on mobile commerce, which accounts for 16% of transactions. Mobile commerce and the Rewards program are vital to maintaining customers and growing comp sales. The recently introduced mobile orders, which allows customers to simply pick up their order and avoid the wait, has been successful in 150 stores in Portland, Oregon. The next step will be expanding this service to 600+ stores in the Pacific Northwest, and then across America. Listed as the most frequent customer requested idea, Starbucks also announced the introduction of a delivery service, a move that should please many current customers. Investors should be excited about the company's focus on mobile as Americans continue to spend more time on their devices. Though Starbucks continues to focus on innovation within its coffee core, rapid expansion is happening in the tea business. Expanding its menu within stores, along with having ready to drink bottles available for purchase gives Starbucks leverage to introduce new tea bars and products. Diversifying its offerings besides coffee products is key to future success at the company. Despite an increase in non-coffee offerings, Starbucks is still exposed to the commodities market, with coffee beans representing only 10% of costs, according to the 2014 Q4 Earnings Call. The 2015 Q1 call suggested that coffee costs "remain well under control." Starbucks has consistently prospered through the volatile coffee bean prices, and the future should be no different. Still, an increased focus on non-coffee products is a positive, as it minimizes exposure to bean prices. Though Starbucks already dominates the morning hours, it is not satisfied. The company wants to continue to bring consumers in through new lunch offerings and through improving the evening experience. Wine, beer and an evening menu have led to success thus far in test locations. As I previously wrote about, Starbucks is an addictive company for consumers due to its caffeinated products . It continues to expand in a variety of fields, but still shows a focus on current customers, employees and shareholders. Continued innovative strategies portray that growth is definitely not over at Starbucks. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
