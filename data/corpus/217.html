Is The USD/CAD Is Poised To Test 1.40? | Seeking Alpha Soft Oil Prices Could Further Erode the Canadian Dollar. The dollar continues to gain traction against most major currencies ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for March 17 and 18. Last week's stronger than expected payroll report seems to have placed a Fed tightening back on the table for the June meeting. Although payroll gains are just one subsector of the labor picture, the recent consistency will likely remove the term patience from the FOMC's upcoming statement. The combination of the dollar strength has created a spiral that is working against the Canadian dollar. Earlier in 2015 Bank of Canada eased interest rates to fend against the negative spiral of declining oil prices. There reasoning was to create a cushion just in case oil prices continue to fall. If the dollar continues to remain buoyed and oil prices remain under pressure the USD/CAD will likely push to new multi-year highs testing the 1.40 level. In March, The Bank of Canada announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3/4 percent. The Bank Rate is 1 percent and the deposit rate is 1/2 percent. The BOC reported that CPI inflation in Canada has fallen as expected, reflecting the significant drop in oil prices. Core inflation remains close to 2 percent and continues to be temporarily boosted by lower Canadian dollar. The average 20-day rolling correlation between crude oil prices and the USD/CAD peaked at 90% during the past 12-months, and has average nearly 65%. This means that most of the time, movements in oil prices occurs in tandem with movement of the Canadian dollar. Although there are many predictions to the next trajectory of the price of oil, what is not in question is the current overhang of crude oil stocks in the United States. As of the last estimate by the Energy Information Administration, crude oil stocks are well above their 5-year average and currently at an 80-year high. With the price of oil likely to remain on the defensive and interest rates in the US continuing to grind higher, the USD/CAD exchange rate should remain on the defensive and over the long term test the 1.40 level. Any further decline in oil prices is likely to be met with an additional rate cut by the Bank of Canada, pushing their benchmark interest rate to 0.50%. This would further widen the 10-year interest rate differential between the US and Canada, making the greenback even more attractive. Source: Is The USD/CAD Is Poised To Test 1.40?
