Wall Street Breakfast: Crude Drops As Inventories Rise | Seeking Alpha Feb. 19, 2015  6:30 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , ABX , BLL , DLPH , EXPE , NSRGY , OWW , PCLN , QQQ , REXFF , SCTY , SPY , SSNLF , SYY , XOM by: Wall Street Breakfast With U.S. inventories expected to hit record highs, crude futures are down 3.9% at $50.76 amid new worries of oversupply. U.S. crude stocks rose by 14.3M barrels last week vs. expectations of a 3.2M barrel increase, said the American Petroleum Institute after Wednesday's settlement. If U.S. Energy Information Administration data today confirms the large build, it would be the biggest weekly addition in barrels since data became available in 1982. Japanese exports surged in January , providing more evidence that the world's third largest economy is slowly climbing out of recession. Exports rose by 17% on year last month, their biggest jump since late 2013, while imports in January contracted 9% Y/Y. Helped by gains in financial and shipping companies, Tokyo’s Nikkei touched its highest level since May 2000 during the session, climbing 0.6% to 18,307.25. Greece aims to conclude a deal with its euro zone partners "soon", said Greece's government spokesman, Gabriel Sakellaridis, this morning. Athens confirmed yesterday it would submit a request to extend its loan agreement for up to six months, but the country still seems to reject the austerity requirements that have been attached to it. Despite the tumult surrounding the extension, the ECB approved a €3.3B increase in emergency liquidity for Greek banks yesterday, after raising the cap to about €65B last week. Exxon Mobil -1.2% premarket after California's workplace safety agency ordered the shutdown of its 100K bbl/day gasoline producing unit at its Torrance refinery yesterday. A blast ripped through the structure in the afternoon, lightly injuring four people. The agency says the shutdown of the Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) unit could last up to six months, and an investigation is underway. Prior to the release of its Q4 results this morning, Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN ) has been reported to be planning a $20M acquisition of hotel-booking startup Rocketmiles, sources told WSJ. The purchase would help Priceline promote lodging bookings through its network, competing with hotels that offer their own rewards to lure users to their websites. The deal comes as Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ) seeks regulatory approval to buy rival Orbitz (NYSE: OWW ) for $1.6B. SolarCity posted a loss in the fourth quarter as it increased investments in new installations and its first panel factory. Net loss came in at $3.6M vs. profit of $26.7M a year earlier, while the company installed a total of 176MW of solar systems, up 70% Y/Y but below guidance of 179MW-194MW. For the current quarter, SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY ) expects a loss of $1.65-$1.75 a share on revenue between $53M-$60M. SCTY -6.7% premarket. Following its slowest annual sales growth rate since 2009, Nestle ( OTCPK:NSRGY ) warned that this year would remain tough as it struggles with deflation in Europe and slowing demand in Asia. While sales dipped 0.6% Y/Y, the food giant posted a 45% jump in net profit to 14.5B francs, helped by price increases, cost-savings and proceeds from the sale of its L'Oreal stake. "We expect 2015 to be similar to 2014," said CEO Paul Bulcke. Nestle is aiming for organic growth of "around 5%" this year. Combining two of the world’s largest can makers, Rexam ( OTCPK:REXFF ) has agreed to be bought by rival Ball (NYSE: BLL ), in a deal valuing the company at around £4.4B ($6.7B). Rexam will recommend the offer to shareholders at 628 pence per share, consisting of 407 pence in cash and 0.04568 of a new Ball share. However, analysts have expressed concern for the deal, which could run into regulatory issues due to the companies' high market shares in many countries. Sysco has hired top antitrust lawyers as its counsel if the Federal Trade Commission files a lawsuit to block its $3.5B purchase of rival U.S. Foods. The move comes after Sysco (NYSE: SYY ) concluded a series of meetings with the FTC last Wednesday and follows concerns from the agency that the deal could limit competition and lead to higher prices. Previously, Sysco and U.S. Foods offered to sell 11 distribution centers with $5B in sales in hopes of an approval. Despite a net loss of $2.85B due to an after-tax impairment charge, Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX ) today reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $174M, or $0.15 a share. Looking forward, the world's biggest gold producer said it would reduce net debt by at least $3B by year-end through asset sales, lower administration costs and a decentralized operating model. Barrick also expects to produce 6.2M-6.6M ounces of gold in 2015 at all-in sustaining costs of $860-$895 per ounce vs. 6.25M ounces of gold at $864 per ounce in 2014. ABX +1.8% premarket. Looking to expand its technology offerings , Mahle has agreed to buy Delphi Automotive's (NYSE: DLPH ) heating and cooling business for about $727M in cash. Mahle will integrate 13 plants in Europe, the Americas and Asia plus development centers in the U.S. and Luxembourg into its global network, and will acquire Delphi’s stake in a related joint venture in China under a separate deal. DLPH +1.9% premarket. Samsung Electronics has acquired mobile wallet startup LoopPay, indicating its intention to launch a smartphone payments service to compete with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Pay and others. Despite strong backing, mobile payments have been slow to catch on, as many retailers have been reluctant to adopt the infrastructure required for the mobile payment options to work. LoopPay, however, works off existing magnetic-stripe card readers by transmitting a magnetic signal similar to that of a swiped card, putting Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) at an advantage. In Asia, Japan +0.4% to 18265. Hong Kong closed. China closed. India +0.5% to 29462. In Europe, at midday, London -0.1%. Paris +0.5%. Frankfurt +0.3%. Futures at 6:20: Dow -0.1%. S&P -0.1%. Nasdaq flat. Crude -3.9% to $50.76. Gold +1.4% to $1216.90.
