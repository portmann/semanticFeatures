Founded in 1999 and headquartered in China, Alibaba Group Holding operates as an online and mobile commerce platform through its subsidiaries.

Moreover, Alibaba offers cloud computing services such as database services, elastic computing, large scale computing, Web hosting and domain name registration in addition to payment and escrow services for buyers and sellers. Currently, the company has over 24,000 employees , and its operations account for more than 60 percent of all packages delivered in China. In 2014, on the Chinese equivalent of Black Friday, Alibaba's websites processed over $5.75 billion in transactions, representing more than three times the typical sales revenue of Black Friday. On January 29, 2015, Alibaba Group Holding announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended on December 31, 2014: Annual active buyers grew to 334 million, an increase of 45 percent. Alibaba added 48 million active users and produced over $1 billion in mobile revenue. Quarterly GMV (RMB) grew 49 percent annually and 42 percent quarterly. Quarterly Mobile GMV (RMB) increased 64 percent. Annual active buyers grew 9 percent in the fourth quarter. Executive Chairman Jack Ma is a lead founder of Alibaba and has served in his current position since May 2013. From its inception through May 2013, Mr. Ma served as chairman and CEO. Mr. Ma currently serves on the board of SoftBank Corp., one of Alibaba's major shareholders and a Japanese corporation listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. He also is a director of Huayi Brothers Media Corporation, an entertainment group in China listed on The Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

Because much of Alibaba's revenue comes from its China operations, its primary competitors are Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and Tencent, which are Chinese Internet companies. Currently, foreign e-commerce sites, such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), have limited access to the Chinese marketplace. However, as Alibaba expands globally, it faces intense competition from some of the largest Internet exchanges, including Amazon, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), Rakatu, Priceline and Flipcart. In addition, conventional retailers continue to compete with online sites for business. Alibaba's IPO priced at $68 per share, at the high end of the expected price range of $66 to $68. The stock opened on the first day of trading at $92.70 and closed at $93.89. It reached a high of $119.15 on November 10, 2014, and it currently trades at $81.58 (3.3.2015). With ~429 million BABA shares, held by two leading insiders, and a whopping nineteen supporting firms , the likelihood that at least some of these could take profits March 18 is high. While BABA has declined slightly in price post-IPO, its major pre-IPO shareholders are likely still itching to cash out on one of the most high-profile investments in the history of IPOs. We've studied the IPO lockup expiration event carefully and found abnormal negative returns of (-5.8%) in the period of days (-11, 9) days surrounding the event day (0). Our work built in on previous studies by researchers at the University of Kentucky , Harvard and Duke universities , and NYU . We suggest investors consider selling BABA in the window prior to the expiration day to take full potential advantage of the event.
