I'm Waiting Patiently For Mr. Market To Ignore This Wide-Moat REIT - Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) | Seeking Alpha There are obvious reasons why a market leader like Realty Income warrants a premium valuation, and I have touched on many of these in this article. I think it's appropriate to consider comparing Realty Income to other market leaders with a similar quality bias rating. While I have no crystal ball relating to the company's future share price movement, I believe investors will have a few more bites at the apple (before rates actually begin to rise). There could be some attractive buying opportunities during the next 90 days, and I consider it prudent to maintain some dry powder. Yesterday, I wrote an article that appeared in Forbes.com, in which I addressed the latest sell-off in REIT-dom. While it's clear that the positive jobs report (last Friday) sparked off the landslide, I can't put my finger on the logic. As I explained: I haven't really figured out why REITs are getting punished, although I have my own suspicions. One of my leading theories is that the growing ETF market may be the culprit. Today REITs are lumped into the Financials sector and accordingly, I think that they get painted by the same brush as bonds. It's great that REITs will soon have their own asset category (under the S&P Index) and maybe they won't move in lockstep with other asset classes. Most financial gurus seem to think that the rates will now begin to rise in June, instead of September, providing growing evidence that the US economic recovery is on more solid ground. The logic (that REIT prices collapse) baffles me, because real estate fundamentals are also improving, and it would seem reasonable to assume that REITs would prosper when market conditions thrive. I put it like this: More jobs = more disposable income and more disposable income = more rental income. Do you get it? The economy is getting stronger and we would not even be talking about interest rates rising if it weren't for improved fundamentals. However, many investors fear that the tremors (or shocks) are warning signs that there will soon be a significant earthquake in REIT-dom. The harbinger argument is rooted in the notion that interest rates will "hammer" REITs and the valuation of these securities will decline to historically low levels. Something like, "what goes up, also comes down". One REIT that gets the most attention these days is Realty Income (NYSE: O ), better known as "The Monthly Dividend Company". Like many Net Lease REITs, Realty Income seems to fall closest to the definition of a bond proxy, since this company invests in properties with long-term contractual leases. There is really no question that Realty Income offers investors a very steady and reliable income, as evidenced by the earnings history. Since the company's IPO in 1994, Realty Income has paid and increased dividends for over 20 years in a row. Keep in mind, though, that Realty Income is different from a bond, because the REIT has income growth. As evidenced by the chart below, the company has grown same-store rental revenue by around 1.5% per year. What makes Realty Income's income characteristics most appealing is the extraordinarily wide diversification attributes - as of Q4-14, the company owned 4,327 properties in 49 states and Puerto Rico. The portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of Q4-14, Realty Income's properties were leased to 234 commercial tenants in 47 different industries, and 79% of rental revenue is from traditional retail properties, while 21% is from non-retail properties, the largest component being industrial and distribution. Realty Income's top 10 and top 20 tenants represents around 37% and 53% of rental revenue respectively. Within the overall portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains favorable. Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) continues to be the largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, and FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) remains the second-largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remain Realty Income's largest industry at 9.8% of rental revenue (down 20 basis points from last quarter). The second-largest industry is dollar stores at 9.5%, down 10 basis points from Q3-14. On the latest earnings call , Realty Income's CEO, John Case, provided insight into the recently announced Family Dollar (NYSE: FDO ) merger: As many of you know, the competition between Dollar Tree and Dollar General to purchase Family Dollar recently ended with Family Dollar shareholders approving the merger with Dollar Tree. Family Dollar is our fifth largest tenant at 4.5% of rental revenues. We view this outcome as an incremental positive given the minimal portfolio overlap Family Dollar has with Dollar Tree and there will be no impact on our tenant diversification metrics. Around 46% of Realty Income's tenants are investment-grade rated, and nearly 70% of the investment-grade leases (as a percentage of rental revenues) have rental rate increases in them which average approximately 1.4% annually, which is consistent with the company's historical portfolio of rental growth rate. As noted above, Realty Income has a very predictable internal growth model, but the company has an equally impressive external growth platform. During the latest quarter, it completed $158 million in property-level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.1%, bringing the year's total to $1.4 billion in acquisitions (at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1%). As I explained in a recent article, Realty Income's investment spreads relative to the company's weighted average cost of capital continues to be well above historical averages. It is investing at spreads over 250 basis points above its weighted average cost of capital. On the latest earnings call, the company said it was raising its 2015 acquisition guidance volume from $700 million to $1 billion, an increase from the initial acquisitions guidance for the year of $500 million to $800 million. In 2014, Realty Income also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. Realty Income has continued to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. In mid-September (2014), the company issued $250 million of 12-year bonds priced at a yield of 4.178% (to pre-fund the preferred redemption). This transaction overall resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million. The bonds (all unsecured in fixed rate) are rated Baa1 BBB+, and have a weighted average maturity date of 7.2 years. Also, the company's $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $223 million balance at year-end and around $382 million of borrowings on the line. The company has around 17% of secured debt (just $39 million of mortgage debt). Not including the credit facilities, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that Realty Income has is only just $39 million of mortgage debt. Overall, Realty Income's debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $120 million in mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015, and the maturity schedule as well-laddered thereafter. Currently, the company's Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization is approximately 30%, and the preferred stock outstanding is less than 2.5% of the overall capital structure. As I mentioned above, Realty Income frequently gets classified as a bond because of the similar bond-like characteristics. Namely, Realty Income has a very predictable income stream, as evidenced by the historical occupancy trends: Keep in mind that Realty Income's occupancy has rate has NEVER dropped below 96%. Here's a snapshot of the company's occupancy by property: Here's a snapshot of the company's occupancy by square footage: Here's a snapshot of the company's occupancy by revenue: In the latest quarter, Realty Income's AFFO per share increased by 4.8% to $0.65, and the 2014 AFFO per share increased by 6.6% to $2.57. As announced in a recent press release, it reiterated 2015 AFFO per share guidance from $2.66 to $2.71. Realty Income has increased its dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compounded average annual rate of 4.7%. More importantly, since the end of the Great Recession, the company has increased its dividend by an average of ~6%. One critical component to Realty Income's value proposition is the reliability of the dividend income. Recently, the company was recognized for its addition to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which measures the performance of companies in the S&P Composite 1500 that have increased their dividend every year for at least 20 consecutive years. Realty Income is one of only six REITs included in this index, and that indicates the company is committed to consistent growth of the dividend. The payout ratio was 84.5%, based on the midpoint of 2015 AFFO guidance, and that compares similarly with the 2014 AFFO payout ratio of 85.3%. What Really Happens To Realty Income When Rates Rise I just presented a fundamental analysis of Realty Income, and while the very stable earnings history offers a compelling argument that the dividends will keep flowing, the question I'm hearing from everyone is: "What's fair value?" On Friday, shares in Realty Income fell around 4%, and the market close on Monday was $49.23. Translating that to valuation, Realty Income is trading at the high-end of the peer group, with a P/FFO multiple of 17.9x. Comparing that to 2015, the company's forward P/FFO multiple is 18x, as against an average 13.6x for the peers. There are obvious reasons that a market leader like Realty Income warrants a premium valuation, and have I touched upon many in this article: (1) strong diversification; (2) a fortress balance sheet; (3) a conservative payout ratio; (4) a growing investment-grade tenant base; and (5) disciplined risk management. In fact, I'm not sure that Realty Income belongs in the same league as many of the others. There's a reason why Lexington Realty (NYSE: LXP ) and Chambers Street (NYSE: CSG ) are trading at the bottom (of the value group) - because there's much less clarity on who would buy them. They are both considered diversified in nature, and they carry a high degree of office baggage. Realty Income only has 44 office properties, and most of them are strategic investments in which the company may already own multiple retail stores and a few select long-term leased office properties (i.e. Walgreens). In addition, Realty Income's Industrial assets are long-term net leased, not the typical 4-year leases you may see with STAG Industrial (NYSE: STAG ). Accordingly, I think it's appropriate to consider comparing Realty Income to other market leaders with a similar quality bias rating. For example, let's consider Simon Property (NYSE: SPG ), Public Storage (NYSE: PSA ), Boston Properties (NYSE: BXP ), Avalon Bay (NYSE: AVB ), and Federal Realty (NYSE: FRT ). Keep in mind, Realty Income is the ONLY Net Lease REIT that has the bandwidth to complete a "transformational" deal. Now that American Realty Capital Properties (NASDAQ: ARCP ) is on the sidelines, Realty Income is the most likely REIT that can withstand a large-scale acquisition. Remember that Spirit Realty Capital's (NYSE: SRC ) high valuation (14.1x) reflects that the company has a takeout premium. As an aside, I find it interesting that there are now three Net Lease REITs based in the Phoenix area: STORE Capital (NYSE: STOR ), ARCP, and SRC. I find it highly unlikely that there will be three next year... In other words, I consider SRC a likely target (the company's president recently resigned). In late 2013, I was fortunate to pick up shares in Realty Income at around $38 per share (with a P/FFO multiple of 15.7x). That proved to be an ideal entry target for me to build a strong base. Since that time, I have been selectively adding more capital on share price weakness. While I have no crystal ball relating to Realty Income's future share price movement, I believe investors will have a few more bites at the apple (before rates actually begin to rise). We saw that on Friday, and I suspect to see continued price volatility until such time that the market ceases to react to irrational forces (perhaps perpetuated by the growing ETF sector). There could be some attractive buying opportunities during the next 90 days, and I consider it prudent to maintain some dry powder. My FAIR value target (entry price) is $46.50 (translates to a 4.9% dividend yield). In summary, fundamental analysis is a key component of understanding the outlook for a company's future profitability and competitive forces. As I consider Realty Income, I view the sustainability (of the dividend) as much more important than the magnitude of economic profits that the company is generating. In other words, a highly certain 20-year dividend stream with modest economic profits is much more " moat-worthy" than a few years of extraordinary high returns on invested capital. I'm not looking for home runs - base hits are just fine! In summary, and as I view Realty Income's positive competitive advantages improving (diversification, balance sheet, etc...), while also considering the premium valuation assigned to the shares (compared with the peers), I must also assess the overall competitive threats (i.e., rising rates) as merely temporary in nature. That, of course, means that my primary objective for owning shares in "The Monthly Dividend Company" is to both protect my dividend income and ascertain that the income grows over time. By definition, a "sleep well at night" stock is a company that consistently offers high dividend yields (as long as those dividends are perceived to be sustainable) that tend to fluctuate less than the overall market, while also leading to superior risk-adjusted returns. Warren Buffett (Fortune, 1999) said: The key to investing is... determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors. REITs mentioned: EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR ), Getty Realty Corp.
