Weibo: Against The Tide - Weibo Corporation (NASDAQ:WB) | Seeking Alpha WB's 4Q14 showed that engagement may have stabilized but revenue deceleration remains. However, with a shrinking microblog market, WB may be challenged by the tide. Weibo's (NASDAQ: WB ) 4Q14 earnings indicated stabilization in engagement metrics and a strong uptick in monetization. However, given that the fourth quarter is generally the peak quarter, stabilizing engagement might be short-lived and we could see further deterioration in Q1. Additionally, revenue deceleration suggests that the outlook remains challenged as ad dollars shift toward stickier platforms such as online video, mobile search and vertical specific channels. Q1 guidance was in-line with consensus. Going forward, WB will likely to face severe headwinds as Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) ramps up its monetization of WeChat, which could be one of the reasons why the company did a CFO swap with parent Sina (NASDAQ: SINA ) in which SINA CFO Herman Yu is now the CFO of WB, while the former CFO of WB is not the CFO of SINA. Yu is an experienced CFO with over two decades of capital market experience and is experienced in communicating key messages to the investor community. During times of hardship, a company certainly needs an experienced CFO (think Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) hiring of Anthony Noto). I reiterate my bearish view on WB and $9 target price. The stock has been down 30% since my initiation last year and I see further downside if engagement level does not rebound. (See: Weibo: Tough Road Ahead; Initiating With $15 Target, 27% Downside ) Net revenue decelerated to +47% y/y to $105m with advertising revenue driving most of the growth at +57% to $88m. Value-added services, which saw +90% y/y revenue last quarter, only grew by 12%, highlighting the volatility of this segment's revenue growth profile. Monthly active users of 175.7m, +36% y/y, was similar to that of the prior quarter while daily active users grew +31% y/y and resulted in an engagement level of 45.9%. The engagement metric has been at 45.9% for the past two consecutive quarters and this may suggest that this metric has been stabilizing. However, it is worth noting that there is a slight seasonality for WB in that Q4 is generally the more engaged quarter due to holidays so we could see engagement to dip in Q1 when users are engaged to WeChat due to the red pocket exchange during the CNY. Furthermore, microblogs are losing its popularity in China. While WB could take share away from rivals, the market itself is shrinking which presents a long-term challenge to WB's growth profile. Remain bearish on Weibo. The simple case against WB is that ad dollars follows engagement. As engagement declines on WB, so will ad dollars and ad revenue growth.
