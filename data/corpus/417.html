The Average Student Debt Load in D.C. is a Whopping $40,885 - Real Time Economics - WSJ The nationâ€™s student-debt tab has more than doubled since the recession to roughly $1.3 trillion , but the burden varies greatly by state. The nationâ€™s capital of Washington, D.C.â€”one of the most educated cities in the U.S. and home to high-priced private schools–is the most indebted compared with states when it comes to average federal student-loan debt. Some 140,000 borrowers in D.C. owe a whopping average of $40,885, according to new data released by the White House. Georgia is second on the list with 1.45 million residents owing an average $30,443. North Dakota sits at the bottom, with 114,000 borrowers owing an average $22,379. The White House released the statistics Tuesday as it unveiled a â€œStudent Aid Bill of Rights,â€? a series of steps it said would empower borrowers in their dealings with the companies that collect student-debt payments on behalf of the federal government. As part of the plan, the White House said it would also study whether to push to make it easier for Americans to discharge student loans in the bankruptcy process.
