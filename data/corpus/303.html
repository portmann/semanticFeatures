Xoom! The Classic Tech Pitch: Lots Of Flash, Little Value - Xoom, Inc. (NASDAQ:XOOM) | Seeking Alpha Xoom is focused far more on top line metrics than shareholder returns. There are fundamental questions about Xoom's competitive viability and business model. Xoom (NASDAQ: XOOM ) is an online exclusive money transfer agent. Xoom's online and mobile platforms allow people to send money to 32 countries around the world. Xoom entered the public market in February of 2013 at $16 a share, issuing 7 million shares ($528 million valuation). Seven months later, Xoom issued another 5 million shares at $30.50 a share ($1.35 billion valuation), which marked a near apex for the company's share price. Xoom is a classic example of a high growth tech story; more a speculation based on the concept of disruption, than an investment based on competitive strengths and profitability. Xoom's annual report reads far more like an IPO slidedeck than it does a 10-K. While Xoom's business acumen is questionable, its ability to execute the classic technology startup playbook has been flawless. Like any technology company looking to cash out its founders, and early investors, it all starts out with the compelling narrative, which is almost always some form of disrupt a dinosaur business by providing a more convenient service at lower cost via the Internet. The large industry players primarily service senders, who fund with cash, which requires maintaining an extensive network of agents in the United States and the associated physical infrastructure...This antiquated model of predominantly cash-to-cash money transfer has not evolved meaningfully in more than 100 years. The traditional model has been plagued by one or more of the following problems; slow transaction processing; non-transparent fees; opaque exchange rates and an inconvenient offline money transfer experience. This is Xoom's elevator pitch: The old guard is overburdened by the costs of the physical world, it has not changed in a long time therefore it must be ripe for change, and Xoom is the first-to-market disruptor with uniquely blinding speed, technological innovation and cheaper costs that will bring about this needed change. Once the highly sellable soundbite is perfected the next step is to prove one's New-Ageiness by stepping into the data-driven world of metrics, growth and colorful graphs. Xoom's favorites ("key metrics") include Gross Sending Volume (even a nice acronym GSV), Transactions, Active Customers, New Customers and Customer Acquisition Cost. This kind of jargon is highly recognizable to anyone in the social media, mobile or app space - sub-sectors that tend to focus on business metrics like daily active users (DAUs), customer acquisition and some form of gross usage (i.e., number of Snapchats sent a day). What do all of these metrics have in common? Every one emphasizes top line growth to distract from any kind of tangible returns for investors. How does Xoom suggest you value the stock in lieu of profits? Adjusted EBITDA; kindly ignore taxes, interest, depreciation and stock-based compensation and Xoom's profit margins effectively double. The tech playbook would not be complete without the mention of mobile. Below is a nice graph expressing how Xoom's mobile penetration as a portion of total transactions is increasing (94% CAGR!), which is good because mobile is revolutionary and a fast growing part of the world. The final step is burning through capital while at the same time finding a way to cash out. The only solution is to take the company public. In Xoom's initial offering 28% of the issue was sold by selling shareholders and underwriters. In Xoom's second offering this rose to 41% of the issue (a moderate to high level). Xoom's GSV (gross sending volume) has grown at an 82% CAGR, a nearly identical number as Xoom's stock based compensation at 83% CAGR. A common sense business person or investor must ask - how is Xoom able to acquire a customer at $43, turn a gross profit of $196 on that customer and end up without a hefty profit? Although Xoom appears not to have a particularly shareholder friendly management, it is important to understand if Xoom really has improved upon the traditional money transfer model and can outgrow the shortsightedness of founding shareholders seeking liquidity. Selfish management does not automatically make a business uninvestable. To answer the question you need only to examine the validity of Management's proposed investment thesis - is Xoom's business structure less costly, more convenient and technologically innovative? Does physical infrastructure add more cost? Yes. However, building the physical locations is not a cost borne by money transfer companies. Cash-to-cash money transfer is done through partner businesses that have already fronted the cost to build a location for an unrelated purpose (supermarket, drugstore, post office etc.). It costs very little to add a service like Western Union (NYSE: WU ) to an existing business. A company like Western Union simply provides training to the staff and the back-end servicing to facilitate the money transfer (telecommunications and software). This "antiquated" system is already highly scalable. Western Union earns 400% on tangible assets and has net margins of 15-20%. Western Union's numbers may reek of market inefficiency, in terms of pricing, but certainly do not speak to the extraordinarily high costs that Xoom claims legacy transfer services have. Xoom is undercutting Western Union on price, however, this is not a competitive advantage if price cuts are not backed by an underlying cost structure that is significantly lower. The issue with Xoom undercutting Western Union on price, from a shareholder's perspective, is that the online model is reliant on a system where Xoom has no leverage to translate the automation cost savings down to the bottom line. Xoom offers customers the ability to initiate transfer exclusively through the Internet, this means running transfers through electronic payment systems. All electronic payments run through the ACH (Automated Clearing House), which, in turn, means Xoom's business runs through traditional banking institutions. With 100% of Xoom's transactions backed by banking infrastructure it raises the question who has more leverage Xoom or major US banks at 700x the size? Can't banks just raise fees if Xoom is profitable? Why wouldn't customers eventually cut the middleman out and transfer money through the banking system? This risk is not exactly hidden, here is Xoom's synopsis of the problem: Banks currently determine the fees charged for ACH transactions and may increase the fees with little prior notices. Our card processors have in the past and may in the future increase the fees charged for each transaction using credit and debit cards which may be passed on to us. Are these transactions done at less cost than cash-to-cash transfers? Very possibly, however, Xoom has absolutely zero pricing power making the reduced cost of the transaction entirely beneficial to customers and banks, not Xoom shareholders. Our disbursement options include direct deposit into recipient bank accounts in all countries we serve, cash pick-up at our disbursement partner locations in most countries we serve. Xoom has not upended the old model because Xoom still will require "partner locations," physical locations, for those on the receiving end of transfers in many places around the world. Xoom's thesis ignores one of the most blindingly fundamental facts about the customers themselves, which is that many of the customers receiving money transfers do not have banks. The need for a non-banking transfer solution is how the money transfer services business developed in the first place. Establishing "agent locations" at non-financial businesses is a core component of getting money to the un-banked around the world. With the exception of North America and Western Europe, in most countries across the world the percentage of unbanked is well over 50% of the population. Xoom has put competitive pressure on Western Union to adapt and compete using the online and mobile channels to initiate transfers. What Xoom is correct about is the desire of many send-side consumers to utilize more convenient methods of initiating transfers. The competitive pressures brought by Xoom have pushed Western Union to invest and adopt Internet send capabilities faster than they might have otherwise. The final and maybe biggest problem for Xoom is that Western Union is leading Xoom's niche "innovative and disruptive" electronic transfer market. WesternUnion.com is already a bigger business than Xoom at $224 million in revenue versus Xoom's $159 million. Western Union is showing that Xoom does not have first mover advantage or some proprietary systems that are difficult to replicate. Western Union is already in 200 countries, with the cash-to-cash model, giving it far more experience with the specific anti-money laundering regulations unique to each country, by far the most significant barrier to expansion. In contrast for Xoom, three countries, India, Philippines, and Mexico, make up 77% of revenue. If Xoom cannot even lead in its own disruptive space against a 100-year old legacy company, trouble is certainly ahead.
