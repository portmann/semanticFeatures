Amid a flurry of high-level visits to Vietnam last year, the US has been pouring in aid and assistance in health, education, landmines clearance, scholarships and nuclear energy. The reason is now becoming clear. As Reuters reports, Vietnam has been allowing Russia to use a former US military base to refuel nuclear-capable bombers as it rattles its sabre over the Asia-Pac region.. and America would like that to stop: "we have urged Vietnamese officials to ensure that Russia is not able to use its access to Cam Ranh Bay to conduct activities that could raise tensions in the region." All that was missing was the "or else." As Reuters reports, the United States has asked Vietnam to stop letting Russia use a former U.S. base to refuel nuclear-capable bombers engaged in shows of strength over the Asia-Pacific region, exposing strains in Washington's steadily warming relations with Hanoi... It is the first time that U.S. officials have confirmed the role of Cam Ranh Bay, a natural deep-water harbor, in Russian bomber plane activity that has increased globally. Brooks said the planes that circled Guam were refueled by Russian tankers flying from the strategic bay, which was transformed by the Americans during the Vietnam War into a massive air and naval base. Vietnam's willingness to allow Russia to use Cam Ranh Bay reflects Hanoi's complex position in a geopolitical tug-of-war that frequently pits China and Russia on one side and the United States, Japan and much of Southeast Asia on the other. Washington is keen to secure greater access itself to Cam Ranh Bay as part of its strategic "pivot" to Asia to counter China's growing strength in the region. U.S. ships have visited for repairs in recent years. Vietnam, in turn, has sought closer U.S. ties as a hedge against what it sees as China's aggression, but remains close to Russia in both defense and energy cooperation. Cam Ranh Bay is now host to three submarines bought by Vietnam's navy from Russia to counter Chinese expansion in the South China Sea, with two more expected by early next year. Brooks said in an interview the flights indicated that Vietnam's Cold War-era ally Russia was acting as "a spoiler to our interests and the interests of others." Asked about the Russian flights in the region, the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington respected Hanoi's right to enter agreements with other countries. But the official added: "We have urged Vietnamese officials to ensure that Russia is not able to use its access to Cam Ranh Bay to conduct activities that could raise tensions in the region." And how will the US 'ensure' this happens... U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Ted Osius said on Friday it was understandable Hanoi would look to "historic partners" when it came to security, but the United States had "much to offer... to enhance Vietnam's security in the short, medium and long term."

The first event occurred on August 2, 1964, between the destroyer USS Maddox and three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. The second was originally claimed by the U.S. National Security Agency to have occurred on August 4, 1964, as another sea battle, but instead may have involved "Tonkin Ghosts" (false radar images) and not actual NVN torpedo boat attacks. The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by "communist aggression." The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-05/these-false-flags-were-used-sta... US is well qualified to ask Vietnam to do that after killing 3.8 million Vietnamese in the Vietnam war.  And a million Vietnamese today still suffer the ill-effects of Agent Orange per the Vietnamese Red Cross Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:17 | 5881832 Latina Lover Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:22 | 5881860 Silky Johnson A lot of fucking balls dictating what actions to take to a nation that we invaded and curb stomped for no damn reason. The cherry on top would have been telling them, "you don't want us coming back, do you?" Fucking arrogant and disgusting. Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:15 | 5882071 Anusocracy Interesting article on measured versus SNP predicted IQs. Vietnam might have a great deal of potential - they did create Topio 3.0. http://www.unz.com/akarlin/genetics-iq-and-convergence/ Vietnam: Phenotypic IQ of 99, versus a genotypic IQ of 106. Certainly a major surprise, considering it is even higher than China. The gap is substantial, but smaller than in India or Africa. This is not surprising, since although Vietnam has the GDP per capita (PPP) of India, it is led by conscientious Communists and is much better off in terms of social development and nutrition (e.g. meat consumption per person is equivalent to that of neighboring, much richer countries). This makes its excellent performance in PISA 2012, which I wrote about in my introductory post on this site, much easier to explain. Consequently, it would also be a strike against Ron Unzâ€™s theory of the East Asian Exception (i.e. that East Asian IQs are very resilient to negative socio-economic and environmental factors). There would still be a substantial gap between Vietnamese genotypic and phenotypic IQ; itâ€™s just that the former are so phenomenally high that the latter canâ€™t help but be very high as well, since Vietnam is at least in terms of social provision no longer a truly Third World country.

Why, just like any  successful organized-crime cartel, their biz model is based on Fraudulent Currency, backed by Force and expanding through Complacency, Fear and Vice.

Are you honestly suggesting we unilaterally and out of the blue declare war on Vietnam? Thu, 03/12/2015 - 14:00 | 5882263 Joe A Hey, that has been the MO in Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, Iraq (twice plus in between), Libya, Sudan. Ok, perhaps without declaration and perhaps not out of the blue but unilaterally yes. Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:17 | 5881836 Dr. Engali What  a bunch of staged Cold War 2.0 theater. The U.S needs a boogie man and Russia fits the bill. Everybody knows you can't trust a damn communist says the comrades of the U.S.S.A. When we don't like the outcome, we ignore it, re-frame it, counter-attack or redefine it.  It's what any good PR Agent or sociopath would do. Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:40 | 5882167 TeethVillage88s I guess he is referring to captured weapons, acting with courage to face an enemy and sometimes just citizens in huts, and having this feeling or understanding that they dominated in the field. However, it is clear that the Public Missions, and Public Objectives were not won or not held.  Nor did US Foreign Police win an overall Mission to Defeat Communism or End Communism. It is like the Norman Schwartzkopf speech about Saddam Hussein.  Only the Vietnamese Communists, China, and Russia won the Strategy and overall Missions.
