Tapping Into The Dividend Secrets Of Connecticut Water - Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTWS) | Seeking Alpha I find a strong correlation with REITs and Utilities; they both generate very predictable dividend income. "This is a misunderstanding of our basic business model." Eric Thornburg, CEO of Connecticut Water. "We take very seriously the importance of our dividend to shareholders. We have paid and increased our dividend now for over 45 consecutive years." Eric Thornburg, CEO of Connecticut Water. A few weeks ago, I made an initial investment in Connecticut Water (NASDAQ: CTWS ) and I also decided to "tap into" the utility sector by researching and writing on a few select utility stocks. Admittedly, I find a strong correlation with REITs and Utilities and while they both generate very predictable dividend income, I'm also a trained value investor where I feverishly seek out high-quality stocks that I can own with a margin of safety. My article (on CTWS) generated considerable page-view traffic, so I know that I'm not the only investor looking to build a durable income of "SWAN" (sleep well at night) income. In addition, the article provided terrific feedback (from the bulls and the bears) that greatly enhanced the debate as to whether owning shares in CTWS seems logical. In addition, another article on CTWS surfaced last week and the author went against my BUY recommendation and opted to pursue a thesis based on the perceived notion that high cap-ex requirements could erode utility profits for companies like CTWS. After reading the article, I decided that I would reach out to CTWS and see if the company could assist me with answers to the author's bearish research. Fortunately, I was able to connect with the Chairman, President, and CEO, Eric W. Thornburg. I thought this interview would be of interest to all on Seeking Alpha. Brad Thomas: As you know, I spend a lot of time writing on the REIT sector. It seems that many of the new Infrastructure REITs are crossing into the utility space. What are your thoughts on the blurred lines with REITs and Utilities? Eric Thornburg: Thanks Brad! I really appreciate your work on educating investors! I think there remain some very crucial differences for investors to understand. Public Utilities are natural monopolies. We are obligated to provide service to all consumers within our state authorized footprint. In return, regulators must set utilities' revenues at a level that recover the utilities' investments in infrastructure (through depreciation), the cost of providing service (our operating expenses), and also an opportunity to earn a fair return on its investment (return on equity). This "regulatory compact" provides the framework for long-term financial strength and stability that is the hallmark of utility investments. Additionally, a utility's dividends are taxed as qualified dividends, rather than at the higher ordinary income rate that REIT dividends are subject to. This represents a significant advantage for the typical yield searching investor. Betas, which measure the volatility of a security relative to the overall market, have been lower for utility investments. That allows a utility investor to enjoy both strong yields and peace of mind during uncertain times. Thomas: I recently read an article suggesting that higher cap-ex could eat into profits for utility companies. How has your company been able to balance spending? Thornburg: This is a misunderstanding of our basic business model. The "regulatory compact" paves the way here. We are permitted by law to earn a "return of and on" our capital expenditures. As we invest in the needed infrastructure to serve our customers and communities, the rates we are allowed to charge are adjusted to allow recovery. Further, the vast majority of our capital spending at CTWS is not driven by mandatory EPA requirements. The largest component is voluntary infrastructure replacement of aging pipe. Water utilities and regulators agree that there is a real need to focus on pipe replacement. The underground grid is reaching the end of its useful life and requires systematic replacement. If you do not manage this properly, the result is elevated water loss through leakage and main breaks. That needlessly wastes the electricity and chemical resources expended to move and treat the water that was lost as it moved through those porous pipes. In Connecticut and Maine, we have some world class cost recovery tools that regulators have put in place to incentivize us to "do the right thing" and replace this aging infrastructure. Through a WICA (Water Infrastructure Conservation Adjustment) we can add an immediate surcharge to customer bills without going through a time consuming traditional rate case eliminating regulatory lag. A similar mechanism exists in Maine, the Water Infrastructure Service Charge (WISC) that covers all infrastructure replaced by the utility. So you see that our investments in infrastructure are quickly recovered through surcharges on customers' bills. The program has been in place for 7 years in Connecticut and 3 years in Maine. The results have been great for customers and shareholders. Thomas: More specifically, how does the Safe Drinking Water Act impact your business? Thornburg: The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was passed by Congress in 1974 to protect public health by regulating the nation's public drinking water supply. At that time, only a handful of contaminants were regulated. Today, the EPA sets standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators in drinking water. The presence of indicators at a level outside of specified limits may reflect a problem in the treatment process or in the integrity of the distribution system. The systems need to be monitored, tested, and if problems are detected, systems need to be brought back into compliance. Every day, 400,000 people in Connecticut and Maine reach for the tap, turn on the shower, and flush the toilet knowing that we will be delivering a reliable supply of high-quality tap water that promotes good health, hygiene, and sanitation. Our record of performance in this area is truly outstanding. Maintaining the public's trust in the quality of their drinking water is of paramount importance to us. As a regulated water utility, all of the capital expended and operating costs incurred to meet and exceed these standards are recovered in the water rates we charge. As I said before, the vast majority of our capital spending at CTWS is not driven by mandatory EPA requirements. The law has been in place for about 40 years. We did expend major sums in the early 80s to build new filtration plants and upgrade treatment techniques and systems in order to assure compliance. Currently, our largest component is the voluntary replacement of aging pipe. For many years, water utilities deferred pipe replacement while they tackled the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. So we are truly now in the pipe replacement era. Thomas: Let's address the stability of the dividend. Your company has an enviable record of paying and increasing dividends for over 45 years in a row. How do you sustain that record? Thornburg: We take very seriously the importance of our dividend to shareholders. We have paid and increased our dividend now for over 45 consecutive years. Our payout ratio is in the 50% range, which is extremely healthy. Dividends are funded using cash from operating activities, and we have a clear, visible revenue stream from regulated customers Proven track record executing accretive acquisitions to grow our regulated customer base Approximately 90% of our revenues comes from stable residential customers - no industrial economic cycles to impact our earnings. Our water rates allow returns on conservative and prudent utility capital expenditures in the range of 9.75 to 10%. Add to this our complementary, low-risk, non-regulated utility services business Thomas: The author (referenced above) said that Capex could impact your company's payout ratio. What are your thoughts? Thornburg: Again, this is what separates utility investments from typical securities. Think of prudent Capex as a driver for returns to our investors! As I discussed before, there is a national awareness of the water infrastructure challenge and potential impact on access to safe drinking water. The operating and maintenance costs of running a utility such as payroll, taxes, and power are passed through to customers at the utility's cost. We have internal teams focused on managing our costs and continually looking for ways to drive operating efficiencies and savings to reduce the impacts on our customers' rates. At the same time, a cornerstone of the regulatory process is the opportunity to earn a return on infrastructure investments that are prudent and used and useful. This ensures that capital is spent wisely. Prudent investment in infrastructure is critical for water utilities because of the capital intensive nature of the industry. We measure the capital intensity in terms of the net dollar amount of assets needed to generate one dollar of revenue. In a 2009 report published by the Water Research Foundation, the capital intensity of large investor-owned water utilities averaged $3.45 compared to $1.61 and $1.11 respectively for electric and telecommunications utilities. It's not hard to see why we are so capital intensive, when the cost of installing one foot of water main in New England averages $150 to $200. Also consider that water mains installed during the post-World War II boom have been in the ground for nearly 70 years and coming to the end of their useful life. In fact, there are over 650 million miles of water mains in the United States according the American Water Works Association (AWWA). AWWA has also estimated that more than $1 trillion will need to be spent on water main replacement over the 25 years. Failing to replace aging water mains means more frequent service interruptions (the American Society of Civil Engineers already estimates there are more than 650 water main breaks each day!). Aging pipes are also responsible for underground water leaks that result in the loss of a precious natural resource and increased operating costs for treatment chemicals and power required to pump water that never makes it to the customer. The need is there for capital investment in the water industry and there is an opportunity under our regulatory structure to earn a fair return on that investment for shareholders.
