XBiotech on deck for IPO | Seeking Alpha Mar 12 2015, 13:17 ET | By: Douglas W. House , SA News Editor Austin, TX-based XBiotech (XBIT) is set for its IPO of 4M shares of common stock at $18 - 20. The clinical stage biopharmaceutical firm develops "True Human" monoclonal antibodies, those that occur naturally in humans, for treating a variety of diseases. Typically, monoclonal antibodies are derived from animal immunization or engineered. The company believes that naturally occurring antibodies are potentially safer and more effective than their non-natural counterparts. Its lead product candidate is the Phase 3-stage MABp1, branded as Xilonix, a therapeutic antibody that neutralizes interleukin-1 alpha, a pro-inflammatory protein produced by leukocytes and other cells. Unchecked inflammation can lead to a variety of diseases such as cancer, vascular disease, dermatitis and diabetes. The FDA designated it for Fast Track review for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in October 2012. The company has also developed a True Human pipeline and manufacturing system to support the development of additional therapeutic candidates.
