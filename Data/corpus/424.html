“I come not to bury bonuses, but to praise them” | The Big Picture Yesterday the New York State Office of the Comptroller released its annual report . The report is chock full of great tables and charts (see this ,Â  this , andÂ  this ). The key takeaways include these data points: â€¢Â The bonus pool for securities industry employees who work in New York City grew by 3 percent to $28.5 billion in 2014. â€¢Â The average bonus rose by 2 percent to $172,860 in 2014, the highest level since the financial crisis. â€¢ The securities industry added 2,300 jobs in New York City in 2014, after years of downsizing. â€¢ The cost of legal settlements related to the 2008 financial crisis continues to be a drag on Wall Street profits. Two factors have made Wall Street bonuses a contentious issue: The size of the payouts, and that they were awarded in so many companies that had been bailed out. I have been highly critical of both Wall Street and the bailout of banks during the crisis. However, it’s importantÂ to distinguish how Wall Street’s rank and file employees are compensated from what senior management â€œgot away with.â€? Most professionals understand this difference intuitively, but much of the public and many elected representatives do not. They viewÂ enormous bonuses as a sign of excess or corruption. As a denizen of the Street for a few decades, I’ve receivedÂ bonuses big and small. TheÂ bonus structure on Wall Street serves three primary purposes:Â  Continues here Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance, unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge.

Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous. This is why regulation, investigation, prosecution, and clawbacks are so essential for Wall Street’s own long-term survival. And most people know that those little insider trading prosecutions were just show trials to keep the attention away from the real stuff. If Wall Street wants to operate as a Wild West culture where anything goes and muppets can be sacrificed on the profit altar, then Wall Street needs to be prepared to live with steady decline in public trust and approval. Look at how fast Lance Armstrong plunged once the truth came out. The steroids era in baseball could keep some of the career home run leaders out of the Hall of Fame for decades or forever. Nixon’s legacy has never recovered from Watergate and Vietnam/Cambodia despite his major foreign policy and environmental accomplishments. America’s doesn’t mind people getting rich for high quality work. That is the American Dream. However, Americans don’t like it though when that money was effectively stolen from them. If obvious transgressions go unpunished, then the assumption is that there is probably lots of fire below that smoke and everybody involved is tarred with the same brush. So far it appears that Wall Street has elected to close ranks in front of the worst offenders and prevent any from being investigated and prosecuted. The constant parade of new transgressions showing up with large civil fines, but no individual prosecutions, means that the culture is not changing. That is a conscious choice that has public relations consequences. The fines are clearly just a cost of doing business and so is rock-bottom approval ratings. We can only assume that Wall Street will not be looking for public support of another financial bail-out in the near future. i am going to guess that public trust of wall street will be like it was after the great depression. seems like that generation never did get over that bit of flim flam Ritholtz has been observing capital markets with a critical eye for 20 years.
