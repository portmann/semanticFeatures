GM: Is The Buyback Even A Good Thing? - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha GM announced a $5B buyback, prompted by activists in the stock. We don't think the buyback here is necessarily a good thing, even though the stock appears to be cheap. Cash flow and net income haven't grown & the company has. We've previously noted that General Motors (NYSE: GM ) was in need of help: buying back stock isn't exactly what we had in mind, and to us, it confirms that the market in general we're seeing continues to look "toppy". Yes, GM's stock is cheap, but the company would fare better, we believe, by preserving their capital or investing it in the brand to assure continued growth over the next few quarters and into 2016. However, the trend this year and last has been buybacks, so why not give in to investors looking for a quick buck, jump on the bandwagon here while the stock appears cheap and needs a boost. The company continues to underperform the S&P and its peers in the sector, which we think has to continually do with the brand's image post-ignition switch recall. GM doesn't hold the same promise as other automakers, as many believe the company has had its shot and already failed. The crazy thing is that on principle, a lot of people won't buy GM. We know because all three of us at the office discuss on a regular basis why we are cut from that cloth. The remnants of the company's past and its "new" problems are still ongoing. But the company continues to issue recalls, not just on its ignition switches, but on other parts of other GM products. We think GM is going to face a much bigger issue in the coming quarters and years, which is how to continue growth consistently when the economy turns or rates go up. Lending will dry up, less people will finance, incentive selling will take a hit. In the case of an actual short-term correction or a moderate pull back in the auto market (which cyclically we're going to be due for soon enough) is GM going to have found itself spending $5B in capital on a buyback that it didn't really need to do? As investors, we'd rather see the company sit on the cash for now or reinvest it into the business. Buybacks are great for working the EPS numbers in subsequent quarters, but that's not going to drive true growth for the auto manufacturer. We think buybacks are relatively sacred, and should only be undertaken by companies that are in aggressive growth that has been sustained for years and looks to continue. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a perfect example of this. Apple is a company primed to return capital to shareholders because it has tons of cash and is consistently outperforming its own (and the market's) expectations. General Motors isn't even close to this type of performance. While it's an analyst favorite, we look past the attractive numbers. For the better part of the last 5 years, net income has hardly shown consistent growth and like revenue, it looks to have simply ceased growing materially. GM Net Income (Quarterly) data by YCharts The company's cash flow tells the same story. Consistency, but hardly the growth that people are looking for when they invest with a forward looking timeline of 5-10 years. GM Cash from Operations (Quarterly) data by YCharts Which is why valuing the company on its P/E just doesn't seem to make a ton of sense. And it's also why we don't think buying back stock here is much more than a short-term band-aid. And we will admit, on paper a forward P/E of around 8x should look appealing, even for an automaker. But it seems investors are sensing that growth could be short lived. The company buying back stock here makes sense in the sense that the stock is "technically" undervalued, but doesn't make sense in that it's spending $5B of the $25B they have on hand when they carry the liability of the ignition switch recall coupled with $46B in debt. Based on the company's history that's built into its name and lack of performance this year, we're afraid buying GM for the buyback may just only help support shares at current levels while giving the company time for its sales to potentially taper off. We're not impressed by the news, and we're not buyers here. We place a $32 target on GM for 2015. Source: GM: Is The Buyback Even A Good Thing?
