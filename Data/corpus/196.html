General Electric's (NYSE: GE ) CEO Jeff Immelt has been the focus of several articles recently. Rumor has it Immelt's days are numbered. After contemplating Immelt's potential departure for some time, the thought General Electric should break up completely crossed my mind. General Electric's latest blunder going all-in on oil and gas may have been the final straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. In the following article I will do my best to deconstruct the pros and cons of a General Electric break up. General Electric's stock's colossal underperformance General Electric's stock has massively underperformed the S&P 500 index over the past ten years. In fact when comparing the two, the S&P 500 is up approximately 85% while General Electric's stock is down close to 35%. General Electric is a massive global conglomerate with an approximately $255 billion market capitalization. The company practically has its finger in just about every industrial business across the globe. The opportunities for growth across the globe are enormous, yet the constant game of whack a mole is getting old. Endless game of whack-a-mole getting old Every time General Electric seems to be on the verge of breaking out, one of the eight business segments seems to come under duress. The latest business segment to come under fire is the oil and gas segment. Immelt has taken a huge amount of heat for this development. Yet, is his defense, no one could have predicted the drastic drop in oil prices. Nevertheless, Immelt is the captain of General Electric's ship and must atone for this transgression. I believe Immelt's long arduous journey will soon come to an end. The final split-off of General Electric's 85% stake in Synchrony (NYSE: SYF ) may be his last act as CEO. This is pure conjecture on my part, yet I believe the writing is on the wall. I wrote an entire piece dedicated to type hypothesis. Now, over the last few days, I've been thinking of what may lie ahead for General Electric. What could the new CEO do different? That is when the thought hit me. Maybe the best way to create shareholder value going forward is to break up the entire company. After reading the title of the slide, "The GE Store," the first thing that popped into my head was, yeah, General Electric needs to put each of these segments up for sale. That would be the best way to create shareholder wealth. My second thought was if I had my druthers I'd buy the Aviation and Healthcare businesses and sell the rest. I am sure General Electric's size and scale have some synergistic effects on growth and profits, yet it appears this positive is far outweighed by the negatives of having a finger in every pot. It brings to mind the story of Winnie the Pooh getting his head stuck in the honey jar trying to get at every last drop. It's not only time for new leadership at General Electric, it may be time for an entirely new business plan as well. I believe the announcement of Immelt stepping down will provide some positive momentum for the stock in the short term. Nevertheless, the new CEO must come with an entirely new business plan to really get market participants excited about the company. I have a feeling we will soon be hearing of activist involvement in the company. At this point, I'd say that is a good thing. The successful spin off of Synchrony may provide the blueprint for the spinoff of several other business segments as well. I see all these potential developments as extremely positive for the stock. Current shareholders would be foolish to sell out now. Why current shareholder should hold tight General Electric appears undervalued on a relative and historic basis. General Electric does have positive catalysts for future growth and pays a hefty dividend of nearly 4% at the time of this writing. Nevertheless, the stock is trading at a significant discount to its peers. On top of this, General Electric has strong free cash flow at over $3 billion last quarter. Free cash flow has risen steadily over the past six months. Presently, General Electric trades at a significant discount to its peers and the industry on a free cash flow basis. Profitability is the company's weak spot though. General Electric lags its peers when it comes to profitability. Even so, I expect this situation to change in 2015-2016. The impending exit of Immelt will be the first step in the right direction. There may be more volatility in front of us even with the nearly 300 point drop in the market Friday. Nevertheless, this may be a good point to start a position in this high yield dividend paying blue chip stock. The exit of Immelt will be seen as a huge positive for the stock. Furthermore, if an activist such as Carl Icahn steps into the mix, who knows what may happen next. Even so, it would be remiss of me not to point out the current downside risks. Geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern as the precipitous drop in oil has caused many oil exporting countries such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela substantial financial pressure. The Middle East remains an area for concern as well. With the market still near all-time highs, stocks are subject to headline risk. Short-term traders usually sell first and ask questions later at times like these. Many are speculating the drop in oil is more than simply a supply side issue pointing to a massive slowdown in China. Even though General Electric is not heavily invested in China currently, this could become an issue for General Electric. As China appears to be the company's next big growth aspiration. The market remains near all-time highs The market has sold off recently, yet remains near all-time highs. The recent spike in volatility could be a signal that the tremendous bull run we've had over the past six years may be coming to an end. This is exactly why moving into safe haven plays such as General Electric makes so much sense right now. There is no shortage of bears out there when it comes to General Electric's future prospects. Nevertheless, this only underpins my contrarian thesis that the stock offers an excellent buying opportunity for savvy dividend growth investors. If you are looking for the opportunity for both capital gains and income production General Electric fits the bill. I believe 2015 will be the year shareholders finally reap the rewards. Furthermore, General Electric has an excellent track record for returning capital to shareholders and currently yields 3.62%. General Electric's stock currently offers an attractive buying opportunity for dividend investors who are focused on the long haul. If you are a current shareholder I suggest holding tight. You may end up kicking yourself in the near future if Immelt does step down. If I was a dividend growth investor looking to start a position, I would at the very least layer in over the next year to reduce risk. Those are my thought on the subject. I look forward to hearing yours. The question remains… Should General Electric do more than just replace Jeff Immelt and begin the process of spinning off certain business segments?
