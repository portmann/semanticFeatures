Baytex Energy: Buying Some Time - Baytex Energy Corp. (NYSE:BTE) | Seeking Alpha Baytex agrees to sell 28.8 million to 33.1 million common shares for ~CAD$17.35 (~USD$13.01). The company would raise from CAD$500 million to CAD$575 million (USD$375 to USD$431 million). This offering is essentially buying Baytex some time for energy prices to recover. However, existing shareholders will be diluted by ~17% to 20%. Last night, Baytex Energy (NYSE: BTE ) announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell 28,820,000 common shares at $17.35 per share. This offering will raise gross proceeds of approximately $500 million on a bought deal basis. The company has also granted the underwriters an over-allotment option for up to an additional 4,323,000 shares. If these shares are also sold, Baytex would raise $575 million. The syndicate of underwriters is co-led by Scotiabank and RBC Capital Markets. What a "bought deal" means is that the investment banks have committed to buy the entire offering from Baytex. This ensures that Baytex will receive the amount of capital it sought to raise, but the trade-off is the deep discount applied for the shares sold. Indeed, in Canadian dollars, the $17.35 per share is a 6% discount to yesterday's closing price of $18.25 per share on the TSE. In US dollars, CAD$17.25 would equal only ~$13.01 per share due to the current 0.75x exchange rate, which would represent a 9% discount to yesterday's closing price of $14.29 per share on the NYSE. Baytex noted in its press release that it was issuing these shares to lower its outstanding bank debt, increase its working capital, and fund ongoing capital expenditures. However, this language appears to be more of a legal boilerplate. The principal reason for Baytex to issue shares is to lower its overall debt pile. The company seriously leveraged itself last year when it bought Eagle Ford based Aurora Oil & Gas for USD$2.6 billion. The company funded this deal mostly with debt, tripling its debt pile from $800 million to the current $2.3 billion, as of Q4 2014. Assuming Baytex uses the full $500 million to pay down debt, total debt would fall to $2.1 billion. This is important as Baytex was close to breaching some of its financial covenants. In its Q4 report, the company noted that its lender group had revised some of its covenants through 2016, essentially giving the company some breathing room to allow for energy prices to recover. Lastly, let me touch on Baytex' comments during its Q4 2014 conference call. The company was asked directly by an analyst at RBC about its capital plans, including a possible equity raise. The full exchange is below: And my final question is just with respect to how you would prioritize the levers that you have. You have used a couple of them already in terms of a CapEx cut and the dividend cut. On a go forward basis looking at CapEx dividends, balance sheet borrowing possible new equity issues, how would you rank those? Where we're at today, Mark, is we have taken the very large levers we pulled. The first two were pretty big moves on our capital. We took the biggest move on our capital right out of the gate in December. We made another modification about three weeks ago. In December the other big move we made and with a lot of well thought out and concern, was our reduction in the dividend at the time. Going forward we have our bank facility set up nicely to carry us through to the end of 2016. We're quite optimistic about that. While we don't see a CAD90 world coming back anytime soon as a result of those moves I have described we can foresee ourselves balanced in the mid CAD60s going forward. That's a very nice position for us to be in. And then lastly, we did two other things. In addition to the recent reduction in the Eagle Ford capital, we back loaded this year for Canadian spend and, frankly, if we don't see some sort of improvement by the mid-year time frame and into the third quarter, we could simply take most of that out for yet another reduction. So, that's kind of our priorities as we see them there today, Mark. You know what, I don't really have anything to say about that. It is certainly a lever that a lot of people have been using today. We feel like we're in pretty good financial shape as we stand going forward and we'll see what the market bears as time goes forward. I do not believe Baytex' CEO was completely honest in his remark. "Pretty good financial shape" implies that the company was NOT looking to issue equity. However, the total opposite appears to have been the case. Usually, conference calls are where much more frank exchanges take place, not vague half-answers. I was not expecting a response which required a degree in Kremlinology to decipher. By issuing equity, Baytex has alleviated one of its short-to-medium term problems. However, the price was painful. Existing shareholders have been diluted by as much as 20%. Coupled with the recent 60% dividend cut , the reward for holding Baytex shares has become much weaker.
