A New Exercise in Industry Rotation  |  The Aleph Blog At Abnormal Returns, over the weekend , Tadas Viskanta featured a free article from Credit Suisse called theÂ  Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook 2015 . Â It featured articles on whether the returns on industries as a whole mean-revert or have momentum, whether there is a valuation effect on industry returns, “social responsibility” in investing, and the existence of equity discount rate for the market as a whole. There is a valuation component in industry returns Socially responsible investing doesn’t necessarily produce or miss excess returns There is an overall equity discount rate, which is levered about 20-25 times, i.e., a 1% increase in the rate lowers valuations by 20-25%. The first two are well-known for individual stocks, so it isn’t surprising that it happens at the industry level. Â The third one has been written about ad nauseam, with many conflicting opinions, so that there is little effect is no big surprise. Â The last one resembles research I saw in the mid-90s, where the effect of changes in real interest rates has about that impact on stocks. Â Again, nothing new — which is as it should be. But now some more on industry returns. Â They found that industry return momentum was significant. Â Industries that did well one year were likely to do well in the next year. Â The second finding was that industries with cheap valuations also tended to do well, but it was a smaller effect. So, using one-year price returns as my momentum variable and book-to-market as a valuation variable (both suggested in the article), I divided industries for companies trading in the US into quintiles (also suggested in the article) for momentum and valuation. Â (Each quintile has roughly 20% of the total market cap.) Â Here is the result: Low valuations are at the right, high at the left. Â Low momentum at the top, high momentum at the bottom. Â Ideally by this method, you would look for industries in the southeast corner. To me, Agriculture, Information Technology, Security, Waste, Some Retail, and Some Transportation look interesting. Â One in the far southeast that is not so interesting for me is P&C Insurance. Â Yes, it has done well, and compared to other industries, it is cheap. Â But industry surplus has grown significantly, leading to more competition, and sagging premium rates. Â Probably not a great time to make new commitments there. Anyway, the above table should print out nicely on two sheets of letter-sized paper. Â Not that it would be a substitute for your own due diligence, but perhaps it could start a few ideas going. Â All for now.

If we get a significant updraft in the price of oil, and Saudi production policy has not changed, you might want to sell crude oil price-sensitive assets. The marginal cost of production for a lot of crude oil that is shale related is around $50/barrel, and that is where […] An Idea Whose Time Should Not Come 4 February 2015 I get fascinated at how we never learn. Well, â€œneverâ€? is a little too strong because the following article from Bloomberg, Meet the 80-Year-Old Whiz Kid Reinventing the Corporate Bond had its share of skeptics, each of which had it right. The basic idea is this: issue a corporate bond and then package it with […] Learning from the Past, Part 3 1 February 2015 I wish I could tell you that it was easy for me to stop making macroeconomic forecasts, once I set out to become a value investor. Â Itâ€™s difficult to get rid of convictions, especially if they are simple ones, such as which way will interest rates go?
