Summit Materials Prepares For Unexciting IPO - Summit Materials (Pending:SUM) | Seeking Alpha Summit Materials manufactures various core products used in construction including asphalt and concrete. Summit Materials has posted tremendous growth over the past three years fueled by aggressive acquisitions. Blackstone has pumped a ton of money into the Company, which it now looks to cash in on a massive payday. Investors should be wary of an over inflated price and wait to buy in until the market has time to adjust. Summit Materials (Pending: SUM ), a Denver-based construction materials company will conduct its IPO the week of March 16. Investors should be prepared for a company that will likely be slightly overpriced with no immediate growth booms. Summit is currently backed by private equity giant, the Blackstone group, who is looking to exit the company at a very strategic time. Blackstone is going to leverage Summit's historic growth trend, high market valuations, and favorable industry outlook to maximize their payday. For individual investors looking to get into the IPO, they should wait until the market has time to normalize and for Blackstone to exit before making an investment. Between 2011 and 2014, Summit posted 197% revenue growth. It is important to note that most of this growth occurred through aggressive acquisitions fueled by Blackstone's and other equity partner's capital. For the same period, the industry average growth was only 38%, which is more indicative of organic growth within the industry. Nevertheless, investors should still be excited by the opportunity of consolidation growth in a highly fragmented industry. Summit will enter its IPO with a proven track record and experience of consolidating the industry. The bad news for investors is most of this acquisition growth was fueled by the large wallets of its equity backers like Blackstone. These equity backers clearly know a large amount about the current business and also a large amount about when is the right time to exit. Thus, after driving drastic growth the equity partners are looking to capitalize on those returns with the company's IPO. Meaning they are exiting at an opportune time for themselves. One of the factors contributing to the exit opportunity is the likelihood that growth will slow after the company has picked many of the low-hanging fruits in the past few years. Summit's full year revenue for the 2014 fiscal year was $1.2 billion. Using data from their S-1, which provided EBITDA through the third quarter, an annualized EBITDA estimate is $140 million. Now based on the initial filing price range of $17-$19 per share, the Market valuation could be as high as $1.75 billion assuming $19 per share and full dilution with conversion of existing LP units. This represents a sales to market multiple of 1.5 and an EBITDA multiple of 12.5. Both valuation methods are aggressive, seeing that the industry average for cement and concrete manufacturers is about .75x sales and 7x EBITDA. Clearly, a great time to exit if you can fetch this type of valuation, and not necessarily a great time to buy, given the lofty prices. Summit has been riding the economic rebound fueled by capital spending, cheap interest rates, and acquisition opportunities. These market conditions will not last forever. First, fragmentation leads to hyper-competitive localized markets, which are difficult to manage. Competitive forces including prices, supply, and demand can vary drastically from location to location. A central management team with 4 years of growth experience is not proof that they can handle every aspect of the business. Second, the construction industry is highly cyclical, which will be difficult to manage growth and capital in slow years. The company has done very good expanding operations during boom years backed by Blackstone's financing. Now the company will be dependent upon capital markets and banks for financing, which will prove difficult especially as the business cycles change. Summit Materials is a solid company with a good track record in growth. They also present a very unique investment opportunity into the consolidating construction and materials industry. However, it appears the company's existing owners are doing a very good job at leveraging these aspects as they cash out their early stage investment. Investors interested in investing in Summit should wait until the market has time to normalize and appropriately price the stock.
