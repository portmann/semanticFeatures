FXCM To The Swiss National Bank: You Managed The Swiss Franc Like A Developing Nation | Seeking Alpha FXCM issued a press release and video presentation describing the details of what it calls the EUR/CHF Flash Crash caused by the currency mismanagement of the Swiss National Bank. FXCM provided revealing details of the chaotic market dynamics that ensued after the Swiss National Bank capitulated on its currency floor for the Swiss franc versus the euro. FXCM describes an intense period where liquidity completely dried up and the company scrambled to save its clients as much money as possible. The irony now is that the Swiss franc has significantly weakened since the vacuum of liquidity motivated the market to panic and overshoot. As trading has calmed down on FXCM, Inc. (NYSE: FXCM ) the company has been hard at work compiling data and illustrating a story to provide additional detail on exactly what happened in the foreign exchange market on January 15, 2015. That was the day the Swiss National Bank (SNB) capitulated on its Swiss franc (NYSEARCA: FXF ) currency floor against the euro (NYSEARCA: FXE ), a day FXCM has cleverly labeled a flash crash in the Swiss franc. The FXCM press release gives a tidy blow-by-blow, nearly second-by-second review of how liquidity dried up and caused all sorts of havoc in the wake of the SNB's surprise decision. FXCM summarizes the ensuing chaos with four bullets: Dramatically Low Pricing - External ECN prices went as low as 0.2000 and 0.5000 Extreme Spreads - The average spreads of EUR/CHF were more than 2000-3000 pips Extreme Range - The average range of EUR/CHF was 6000 pips. A video presentation embedded on the main page provides additional detail on the timeline of events. My favorite quote comes from the very end (emphasis mine): "Like many have said, the 1.2000 SNB floor was completely irresponsible…a decision was made leading to historic market dysfunction…The perception of the EUR/CHF floor was that it was a real rate. Instead, it was analogous to exchange rate manipulations of developing nations." The SNB has of course faced down a lot of heat for its decision and the way it executed the decision. This description is one of the more scathing that I have seen. Of course, FXCM has a particular beef to pick with the SNB given how this flash crash decimated its business. I was half-expecting FXCM to announce somewhere in the video presentation that it would seek legal action against the SNB (of course that will not happen as the SNB cannot be held liable for the risks others take with its currency). FXCM recommended two alternatives for the SNB in managing the currency better: actively manage the floor like shift it gradually or provide "proactive information." SNB President Thomas Jordan has already explained that its biggest fear was the pressure speculators might apply against the Bank if it gave any advance notice about the decision. Recent reserve data show just how much pressure was already building against the SNB. From 2011 to 2012, total foreign currency investments jumped from 205.5M francs to 432.2M francs as the SNB went to work to establish the 1.2 Eur/CHF currency floor. At the end of 2013, these investments had only increased to 443.3M francs. At the end of 2014, these investments soared again, this time by 15% to 510.1M francs. About half of that increased occurred in December, 2014. Of course the bulk of bulge came from the purchase of euros. Some traders had started to smell blood. The SNB may not have really acted like a developing nation's central bank, but it definitely acted like it was under siege….and that siege played out in the forex market. Throughout its presentation, FXCM repeats multiple examples of how liquidity dried up. The company might as well have inserted "…and did we tell you just how badly the market was functioning during the flash crash?" FXCM demonstrated the historic nature of the flash crash by comparing it to other volatile forex events: like the financial crisis, the massive earthquake in Japan in 2011, and regular economic reports that tend to move the market. None of these caused FXCM to go into the tank. FXCM explained that what made this time different was the complete disappearance of liquidity. FXCM runs what is called an FX Agency Execution or No Dealing Desk model. FXCM acts as a middleman passing along pricing and taking a single, flat fee on the trade. This model only works when institutions provide liquidity, and FXCM had buffered itself with up to 12 providers. They ALL went dark during the flash crash and when they did provide liquidity it was at extreme prices. Without the ability to execute stop loss triggers or close out accounts on margin call, some FXCM clients went into negative balances. FXCM had to make these losses whole with its liquidity providers. FXCM further explained that other brokers who survived nearly unscathed during the flash crash operate dealing desks where they take the other side of their clients' trades. Thus, many of these brokers actually made money given the number of retail clients who were long EUR/CHF. Not only did FXCM play the hero (martyr?) in this presentation for taking the fall for its clients, but it also extolled the virtues of its circuit breakers. FXCM claimed that it saved its clients an additional $104M in losses thanks to circuit breakers that prevented the execution of trades at particularly poor prices. The majority of FXCM's clients sold out of EUR/CHF between 1.02 and 1.04 (at the time of writing, EUR/CHF is around 1.065). FXCM noted that the lack of circuit breakers in other parts of the system exacerbated the extreme dysfunction of the market. In fact, FXCM claimed that circuit breakers placed throughout the system would have prevented the entire market meltdown. (Another reason why the SNB can absolve itself of blame: it was market structure that was the problem!) The current irony in all this drama is that, over the two months since the flash crash, the Swiss franc has gradually weakened consistently and constantly. Against the U.S. dollar (NYSEARCA: UUP ) and the British pound (NYSEARCA: FXB ), the franc has nearly returned to trading levels before the flash crash. The U.S. dollar even re-achieved parity. I feel fortunate that I stuck to my guns and recommended shorting the franc even after the SNB capitulation . The British pound completes a 1-2 punch in the recovery against the Swiss franc The euro has made much slower progress of course. Its recovery against the franc ended after a month and since then the euro and the franc have been practically joined at the hip. Has the euro stabilized against the franc for now? Perhaps in the end there was a method to the madness of the SNB. Certainly the flash crash has reduced confidence in the Swiss franc and its management, making the currency incrementally less attractive than previously. The market's retreat from the franc is helping the cause. This is of course a short-term benefit that could hurt the SNB somewhere down the road. Moreover, this gradual readjustment to pre-crash levels also suggests that perhaps, just perhaps, there was a way to figure out how to wean the market off the currency floor without generating so much chaos and severe pain. If only the SNB had not itself panicked… Source for charts: FreeStockCharts.com ( My last post on FXCM covered a revision of the SEC disclosures involving FXCM's rescue plan.
