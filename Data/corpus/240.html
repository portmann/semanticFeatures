A Country ETF Filter Series: Part I- A Look At India - iShares MSCI India Index ETF (BATS:INDA) | Seeking Alpha With the abundant Country ETFs available, there has to be a method to discern the top performers. Investors can create filters to sift through the space to determine what they want. By filtering the geographic space through total return and relative strength, INDA, EPHE and EIRL emerged. Presently there are countless ETFs to choose from in the geographic space and investors can easily choose where they want their portfolios positioned, anywhere in the world. The 1st question that comes to mind is- How do I find the best Country ETF in the universe? There must be some method to the madness. One option is to analyze the fundamentals of each country, and make a decision whether to purchase or sell the ETF that tracks the equity market of that country. While this may work for large financial institutions who can hire hundreds of analysts, the retail investor would not have the time to analyze every ETF. Investors would need to work smart. One strategy is to develop a filter. By filtering the universe using specific metrics on the public data investors can narrow the ocean of ETFs to a glass of water. Then investors can apply the fundamental analyses on the chosen ETFs and come to a conclusion on whether to buy or sell the filtered ETFs. This saves a lot more time than analyzing each ETF in the universe. Utilizing total return data and relative strength data, a country ETF universe was filtered. The filtration process led to the buy recommendations of 3 ETFs: the iShares MSCI India ETF (BATS: INDA ), the iShares MSCI Philippines ETF (NYSEARCA: EPHE ) and the iShares MSCI Ireland Capped ETF (NYSEARCA: EIRL ). As a result of the 3 recommendations this series would be separated into 3, to appropriately cover each ETF. Part I of this focuses on INDA. In searching for value, a filter needs to be applied. A filter is a mechanism utilized for removing impurities and unwanted material. The filters used on this country ETF space are total return and relative strength. Thus by determining the top 3 performing ETFs over various time frames and the ETFs' performance relative to a base or benchmark, value can be retained. This saves a lot more time than analyzing each ETF in the space. For example, the iShares MSCI Ireland Capped ETF was in the top in the 1-Mth Total Return, 3-Mth Total Return and 6-Mth Total Return. Thus it is considered a Country ETF leader from a total return perspective. On the top performing side, the ETFs that remained after filtration on a total return basis were EIRL, EPHE and INDA. These are highlighted in green above. The other filter is relative rotation. The relative rotation chart below allows you to visualize the relative strength of different ETFs against a base or benchmark. The leaders are identified on the top right box in the chart and the laggards are at the bottom left box. The base or benchmark utilized was the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (NASDAQ: ACWI ). EPHE, EIRL and INDA were successful through the 2 filters. Investors should consider the Philippines, Ireland and India for equity investments. This filtration process utilized price data. Historical price data for ETFs can be obtained easily by the ETFs' providers and models can be developed easily on spreadsheets which places retail investors in the same group of financial institutions. Once the ETFs are filtered fundamental analysis should be done to ensure that the recommendation of the filter is aligned with the fundamentals of the ETF. The analysis of this article will focus on INDA. Latest figures show that India's 3rd quarter GDP grew 5.3% year over year, higher than the 4 quarter moving average of 5.1%. India's economy is relatively broad with services making up 57% of GDP, industry represents 26% and agriculture is 17% of GDP. The chart below suggests that the Indian economy has been at historical doldrums, growing around 4.5% since 2012 but momentum to the upside appears to be improving. Also with energy prices and gold in bear markets, the Indian economy has the impetus to grow stronger. Energy and gold imports together make up 50% of the total imports bill. The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) cited growth prospects will be contingent upon a turnaround in investment and a durable improvement in the business climate to complement the upsurge of business optimism. The RBI sees improvements in the economy as a result of the disinflationary pressures and income gains from the declines in energy prices. The central estimate for real GDP growth in 2015-2016 is expected to rise to 6.5% with risks broadly balanced. Indian inflation registered 5.11% year over year in January 2015 which was below surveyed expectations of 5.50%. India is expected to continue to benefit from the decline in energy prices as disposable income will likely be increased. The RBI projects that inflation should range between 4.5% to 7.5% by March 2016. The RBI recently cut its benchmark rate to 7.50%, reflecting national circumstances in the Indian economy. This is along the framework recently agreed between the RBI and India's Ministry of Finance, which targets a decline in inflation to 4%, with a band of +/- 2% by financial year 2016-2017. It is expected that the RBI will cut rates further with analysts calling for a 75 bps for 2015. The RBI has room to cut based on the current state of energy and oil prices. These reductions in borrowing costs should bode well for the Indian economy as well as Indian equities. Leadership in INDA is expected to be maintained over the next couple of months. The Modi government appears to remain committed to keeping the fiscal deficit low despite lower than expected revenue growth. The fiscal deficit is anticipated to reach 4.1% of GDP for the fiscal year ending March 2015. For the fiscal year March 2016 it is projected that the deficit will decline to 3.9%. This reflects the government's expectations of a small increase in tax revenue that is augmented by higher disinvestment receipts. Currently the India MSCI Index is standing at 20.84 times, which is above the 1-Year, 3-Year and 5-Year average, which signals the Index is currently overvalued. Similarly the ACWI Index is trading above its historical averages. This is as a result of the overall interest rate environment. With global yields near historical lows and global central backs are either reducing their benchmark rates or undergoing QE operations, investors are prepared to pay a premium for international equities, elevating the current P/E of the India MSCI Index and the ACWI Index overall. Given the low dividend yield relative to the ACWI, INDA should be construed as a tactical position for portfolio growth. Asset growth and equity growth are growing above analysts' estimates. It also appears that the companies in INDA are reducing expenses as their Sales are less than expected, but EBITDA is better than analysts' estimates. A negative free cash flow further supports capital expenditures are being reduced. With signs of growth in the Indian economy as well as the interest rate cuts by the RBI as a result of the disinflationary pressures, Indian equities are expected to continue to outperform the globe. Recent fiscal policies appear that the current government is committed to bring India to a CorpusPath of continued stable growth and improved efficiency.
