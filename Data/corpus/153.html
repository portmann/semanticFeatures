Valeritas on deck for IPO - Valeritas (Pending:VLRX) | Seeking Alpha Mar 12 2015, 13:42 ET | About: Valeritas (VLRX) | By: Douglas W. House , SA News Editor Bridgewater, NJ-based Valeritas (Pending: VLRX ) is set for its IPO of 5M shares of common stock at $14 - 16. The commercial stage medical device firm focuses on products for people with type 2 diabetes. Its sole offering is the V-Go Disposable Insulin Delivery Device. The product is placed (adhered) on the skin where it delivers insulin at a continuous basal (background) rate over a 24-hour period and on demand around mealtime (prandial). It is the only FDA-approved mechanical basal-bolus delivery device in the U.S. The company began hiring sales reps in H2 2012 and now has 63 covered territories. It estimates that ~13,000 patients were using V-Go as of the end of 2014. The company is working on a next-generation V-Go that is pre-filled with insulin, thereby eliminating the device-filling process required by the current version. 2014 financial performance ($M): Revenues: 13.5 (+118.9%); Gross Margin: (4.3) (+64.2%); Operating Expenses: 54.8 (-24.7%); Net Loss: (6.5) (-135.4%); CF Ops: (48.0) (+43.7%).
