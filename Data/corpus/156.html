ETF Hub Mar 12 2015, 13:25 ET | About: Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (SNCR) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Synchronoss' (NASDAQ: SNCR ) guidance for 32% 2015 cloud services revenue growth is likely conservative, says FBR's Daniel Ives, reiterating an Outperform. The guidance, provided during Synchronoss' Q4 CC ( transcript ) and reiterated yesterday, led shares to sell off post-earnings in spite of a Q4 beat . Ives: "We continue to believe this dynamic points to management's 'under-promise and over-deliver' strategy as the company highlighted strong growth opportunities from solid customer adoption rates, international expansion, the (personal cloud assets from) F-Secure , (an online security and privacy company), strong secular trends (meaning cloud adoption, data growth) and healthy average selling prices, which we anticipate will help drive cloud growth in 2015." He also observes Synchronoss doubled its (white-label) personal cloud subscriber base in 2014 to 24M, something that helped it top guidance for 30% cloud revenue growth. Synchronoss Stock Reverses On Cloud Growth Forecast Synchronoss Q1 Outlook, Q4 Earnings Beat; Stock Rises Synchronoss Makes Cloud Acquisition Ahead Of Q4 The only reason SNCR hs been down in the past is b/c of William Power, who has been off the market entirely on this stock. With so many people realizing his error and the long term stregth of SNCR, the tables are finally turning. As they should. Expect him to make a comment in a day or two, as he usually does, when things appear to be headed the other way. Baby needs his bottle and 'Will' start crying soon.
