Bloomberg IPO Index Underperforming With New-Addition BABA | Seeking Alpha Mar.  3, 2015  3:44 AM ET  |  Includes: BABA by: Bespoke Investment Group Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) was a strong IPO out of the gate, but it has faltered significantly since peaking late last year, and it's dragging down the Bloomberg IPO index that it has a massive weighting in. The Bloomberg IPO index is a cap-weighted index made up of companies that have IPOd over the last year. Because of its massive size compared to most IPOs, Alibaba has a ridiculously high 44% weighting in the index. BABA's size was great for the Bloomberg IPO index when the stock was going up, but its 30% decline from $120 to $84 over the last few months has caused the index to break down and lose out on a significant amount of outperformance versus the S&P 500 over the last two years. Below is a chart showing the performance of the Bloomberg IPO index versus the S&P 500 since the start of 2013. The second chart is simply the spread between the two indexes in the first chart. You can clearly see the performance erosion that the IPO index has experienced lately. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
