Indonesian markets in everything by Tyler Cowen on March 11, 2015            at 2:12 pm               in  Economics , Uncategorized  | Permalink When a listing for a house in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, appeared on a real estate website with the headline â€œRUMAH DIJUAL: Beli Rumah Bisa Ajak Pemiliknya Menikahâ€? (HOUSE FOR SALE: Buy the house and you may marry the ownerâ€?) many people assumed it was a joke. But the houseâ€™s current owner says the above ad, which is featured on property website rumahdijual.com , is completely serious. Below the listing price of the house (Rp 999 million or about US$76,500), the ad reads: â€œOffer of the century!!! Buy the house and you may marry the owner (terms & conditions apply). Only for serious buyers and without negotiation.â€? here in the Philippines, I’ve seen signs that say: “Bed for rent, with girl” (or along those lines).  I assume it’s either a joke, or, maybe, it’s a subtle call for prostitution (but why put it in a sign?), or, it’s something lost in translation. Presumably this is just a hidden dowry.  Girl wants to get married.  Has trouble finding a suitable husband.  Offers a cheap-ish house to sweeten the deal.  And yes, my first guess was right, and she is not even trying to hide it: The 40-year-old widow and salon owner said she has had trouble finding a suitable man, having already tried to date a few times since her husbandâ€™s passing in 2000, but without success. She is 40 and previously married, i.e. not a virgin.  In Southeast Asia, that is probably a bit of an ask.  But at least if she is lucky, she knows he can afford the rest of the cost of the house. Upper class Europeans have been doing this since the dawn of time.  It is just unusual in a polygamous Islamic society where women rarely have trouble finding husbands.
