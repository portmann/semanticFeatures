Gazprom ( OTCQX:GZPFY ), Rosneft ( OTC:RNFTF ), and Lukoil ( OTC:LUKFY ).While there are obvious political risks affecting these companies, they are also some of the most fundamentally undervalued companies in the world currently.The turmoil between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions against Russia have been ongoing for nearly a year now and priced into the underlying company stock prices.If things don't escalate further, these companies can soar.It's also important to remember that while these companies are some of the fund's larger holdings, there is still the diversification of being invested in companies in other countries, Chinese stocks making up the second largest holding.The current risk/reward ratio looks good to me here.You can always limit downside exposure with a stop loss plan in mind and have the potential for huge upside in a relatively short period of time.And if the investment just holds steady at the current lows, you collect a dividend offering, an unusually high yield in today's investments environment.Source: Diversifying Into International Markets Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DEM over the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Conduct in-depth research on DEM and 1,600+ other ETFs with SA's ETF Hub ?
