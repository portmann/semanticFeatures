(NASDAQ: FIVE ) is a specialty discount retailer that sells a wide range of products for pre-teen and teen customers.The company sells both select brands and licensed products, all priced at $5 or below, in categories like Pet care, Sports, Part, Candy, Style, Craft and many more.Growing competitive pressure from other discount retailers is likely to keep FIVE's financial performance pressurized in the near term.But key drivers of the company's long-term growth plan, such as expansion and improvement of its store network in new and existing markets, improving distribution network and creating strong brand awareness will help FIVE better its competitive position and improve financial performance in the long run.In the past few years, the U.S Discount Retail Industry has remained increasingly competitive, due to strategic growth efforts by retailers to improve store traffic through an improved and extended store network, competitive price offers and better quality services.As far as FIVE is concerned, the company has faced tough competition from aggressive growth efforts of other discount retailers like Macy's Inc. (NYSE: M ).Also, giant retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) are adversely affecting FIVE's store traffic.Owing to the strict competition headwinds, the company's sales growth trends have remained weak in recent times.The following graph shows FIVE's steadily decreasing comparable store sales growth trend.(Note: comparable store sales growth for 2014 is based on Equity Watch estimates).The competitive industry environment is likely to pressurize the company's performance in the near-term.However, FIVE has carved out an intelligent strategic growth plan, in a way that bodes well for re-growing its store traffic and reviving its sales base.In this regard, having a better market presence through an extended store network is the primary focus of the company.FIVE is on track to completing its targeted level of opening 62 stores during FY14; by the end of 3QFY14, 61 stores were opened in order to complete its FY14 store opening plan.Also, the company has laid out its plan to open almost 70 new stores during 2015.And to meet its store opening target, FIVE has recently announced its expedition to explore growth opportunities of the Alabama State by opening five new stores .Moreover, the 2015 store expansion plan includes two districts of Florida State.These ongoing store openings highlight that the company is well headed to achieving its long-term growth plan of having a store network of more than 2000 stores.The following chart shows that with its healthy store opening growth rate, FIVE will meet its long-term target range.Along with a strong store-opening pipeline, the company is working hard to create brand awareness by building a strong digital platform.In fact, FIVE's management sees a lot of potential in digital avenues, such as social media and TV, to create its brand awareness among retail shoppers.In this regard, the company has appointed Joel Anderson as the new CEO, who was previously working as the CEO and President of Walmart.com.And since digital is the core area of Mr. Joel's expertise, I believe that he will bring dexterity to FIVE by directing it towards building a stronger digital presence over time.Also, I believe that the strong digital presence goal will uplift the company's e-commerce platform in the long run.In addition, FIVE's aggressive efforts to improve the capacity of its distribution network are rightly headed to earn better margins and earnings stability for the company.As a matter of fact, FIVE has an existing East Coast distribution center located at Olive Branch, Mississippi.In order to supplement its East Coast distribution facility's capacity, the company has announced the construction of a new East Coast distribution center in New Jersey , which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2015.In the near term, the construction of this new distribution facility will weigh on FIVE's margins, due to an increase in operational expense.But will serve as a long-term growth investment for the company, which will enable it to generate profitable growth for shareholders by having an augmented distribution capacity at East Coast that could serve almost 750 stores.The increasingly competitive retail chain environment might hurt FIVE's future earnings growth prospects.Also, I believe that with the changing shopping preferences of teenagers, the company's product offerings might lose their attractiveness for shoppers, causing a sales decline in the quarters ahead.In addition, the unforeseen negative economic changes and lack of innovative product launches might hurt FIVE's performance potentials in existing stores.The company's near-term performance is expected to remain challenging; however, the company has a well thought-out strategic growth formula to fight competitive pressure and improve its financial performance in the long term.FIVE's initiative to constantly grow its store network in its existing and new territories will generate strong revenues by driving more customer traffic to the company's stores.In addition to that, FIVE's plans to strengthen its business operations and e-commerce channels will add towards its top-line and bottom-line numbers.Also, analysts have estimated a healthy next five-year growth rate for FIVE, as compared to its peers, as shown below in the table.Source: A Tough Near Term Will Give Way To A Promising Long Term For Five Below Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
