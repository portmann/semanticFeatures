back in the not-too-distant past, the Inky was a McClatchy paper, and one could expect better things.Now, it is largely comprised of wire service feeds from the NY Times, the LA Times, the Washington Post, AP & Reuters, with only an occasional national/international story from any other sourcing.The editorial page is a right-wing horror, whose most prominent recurring editorialist is the execrable Krauthammer, that smirking fascist.I think that T.S. Eliot had the sense of what it is like for us now, struggling against overmastering odds: �There is only the fight to recover what has been lost And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions That seem unpropitious.But perhaps neither gain nor loss.I also notice that they have spent the last few years being hip, cool, and groovy � to attract a �younger demographic� I suppose.Its mostly just a same-every-hour newsloop now, much more dumbdowned simple than what it used to be years ago.The laughter and jokes on-air annoy me.Some of the interviewers are very good at being rude, hostile, interruptive and staying on message though.“The most startling news at Clinton’s press conference was her disclosure that she discarded roughly 32,000 emails her lawyers decided were personal records�?[Politico].No doubt a forensic data recovery could still find that “discarded�?email.If the hard disk itself were to be made available.Exactly why there should have been a quick court order for the FBI to confiscate the computer and impound it pending legal sorting out.This issue is not being treated as a serious Constitutional/Legal matter.One of those, who could have anticipated/everyone does it/ no one is to blame deals.Unless I miss my guess, those email server hard-drives are already puddles of molten metal at a local smeltery.But c�mon now, what could a Clinton possibly have to hide.Why just yesterday, I said to myself, I says �Llewelyn, I think it�s time to go clean out yer old emails.Just cause them emails are old.32,000 should do the trick.The FBI exists to protect inequality and for no other reason.How�s not tamping the lid down on this ASAP fit that mission?A little too philosophically nuanced I suspect.The organizing mission of the  FBI is to perpetuate the FBI, which to be fair is probably true for most any government agency.Although they have a reputation for being  about the most indolent LEO�s that exist, it all depends on for whom the dog is hunting.My simple math:   During an election cycle, I receive between 150-200 emails / day.And I am but a mere mortal.How are the knockoff apple watches with battery life?Has there ever been a case where the knockoff was better than the original?Often times, when neoliberalism is copied and practiced in a new country, it�s the better (harsher) version.Or when a new bubble is re-created (copied), it is usually bigger (and presumably better).Your post made me remember something and laugh � my brother-in-laws collection of cheap knockoff watches from the lower east side of NYC.He is a discerning collector though, and only gets the ones with something wrong � he has a �rollex� and a �philip patek�.Who knows what kind of Apple knockoff he�ll own someday� �Congressional branch prerogatives�?(Iran letter).Where were they when the Executive was launching brand new wars across the globe?When he was refusing to enforce the rule of law for banksters?When he was trampling the Constitution with illegal warrantless spying?Secretly negotiating toxic corporo-fascist trade deals?I wish they would take just one prerogative they do indeed have: to represent their constituents.There are some gentlemen here from the SEC who would like to speak with you.Also some guys from Wall Street with suitcases full of cash.Your pick.Ah, the delusion that weapons win wars.Well, weapons are important, but people willing and able to use them and properly trained and led are vastly more important than any assortment of weapons.The rebels are not particularly numerous or that smartly armed, but they are pretty obviously well led and motivated to fight hard.Americans are obsessed with the qualities and specs of weapons.They�d do better to find �allies� who actually wanted to fight.We have different clocks in virtually every organ of our bodies [NPR].So what happens if the clocks get out of synch?Look to the pituitary gland send out some form of �Its Dawn� trigger and �Its Nighttime� trigger (a synchronization signal).Hey I just got my 105mm f2.8 macro lens.I�ll send some more tiny plant pictures soonish.After I finish a set of wedding photos I�m procrastinating on finishing.Exceptionalist Feminism meets The Rich Uncle Pennybags Test (Fredrik de Boer).A very simple heuristic to inform whether something is a meaningful political action, or just a meaning in search of action, any action.</div></body></html>
