assault of fake news on social media has turned a portion of the public against Monsanto.Monsanto is highly profitable with great historical earnings and dividend growth.The competition has good reasons to fear Monsanto.Their brand name is synonymous with GMOs.An exponentially growing population and severe weather will ensure growth for years to come.You can exploit that fake news by buying before the public better understands what Monsanto does.I'm a big fan of social media.I think Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) are fascinating, informative, and addictive.I love pop culture and breaking news and all the memes.I'm one of those people who checks my feed a hundred times a day, and it gives me a great way to have a finger on the pulse of what's popular out there.What I don't care very much for lately is the recent trend of fake news articles.It was funny when The Onion was the only website out there doing it, but now it seems like everyone wants to publish these "parody" articles, or even worse, deliberately pass something off as news without any truth to it.These sites have disclaimers in the fine print that they are humor or parody sites as well, but with The Onion the parody is usually immediately evident.You can tell right away that the articles aren't meant to be taken seriously.Well, most of the time.Apparently they slip one through, undetected, occasionally too.It's not as if I'm against freedom of speech either, but lately I've been seeing more and more of this fake news as a type of attack on businesses I happen to like a lot.So I'm here today to use the Seeking Alpha soapbox to make my voice heard.And the company I'm here to defend is Monsanto (NYSE: MON ).I think they might just be the 21st century's most amazing Agriculture company.But look at this smear campaign.Every day I see more and more terrifying images: Since this is a business article site, I'm not going to be able to spend a lot of space debunking garbage, which is unfortunate, because I would love to do that for you.What tends to end up happening though in debates about Monsanto is that, as I make an effort to shift more of the "burden of proof" onto these sites, the readers come right back asking me to provide proof that the stories can't be proven!<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you do a Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) search for Monsanto it will produce 22.7 million search results today, and a large percentage of the articles accusing Monsanto of being up to no good (GMOs making rats sick, glyphosphate being a deadly poison to humans, "Roundup ready" seeds being unsafe to eat, etc.) are total fiction.</span>Monsanto publishes a website of their own dispelling many of these rumors.You can view it here .I can't personally disprove them all, but I do have one good example I can go over with you today.Have a look at this article: Moms Across America: Full account of Monsanto shareholder meeting .Seeking Alpha is a good place to address the facts in the "Moms" article specifically, because the readers of this site should be able to immediately know why it is suspicious.The Moms gives an account of the speech that Zen Honeycutt, the creator of the site gave at the January 31st, Monsanto shareholder meeting.The allegations she made in the speech aside, she claimed that the shareholders took an on the spot proxy vote to make changes to the company based on her speech.That is a half-truth; the Moms were actually at the meeting, and did actually say those things, but the proxy vote that occurred that day was about a completely unrelated issue about electing leadership changes.If you are new to investing and don't realize what is amiss, I'll explain it.Proxy votes don't happen on the spot.That's what the word "proxy" refers to, it's a ballot that's sent out ahead of time to shareholders so that they can send in their votes.Proxy voting means to cast a vote on your behalf.You cannot not be there and still vote to pass something.That article is an insult to the intelligence of people who are unfamiliar with how the stock market works.The problem is, those people just don't realize how often this kind of thing is going on.Some ordinary critical thinking will be able to reveal to you easily that these articles and pictures are nothing more than an appeal to emotion.Fortunately, there are fairly easy ways to overcome logical fallacies and recognize bad information.I think that this article here is a very good starting point .The seething amount of hatred aimed at Monsanto makes little sense.It's not as if they are the only company that makes GMOs.There are 22 others named in this article alone .So why is Monsanto the only one that gets mentioned by name?Why so much focus on "Roundup Ready" seeds?My theory: Monsanto is not the most hated, they are the most feared by their competitors, because they are the best at what they do.If I were to generate a bit of rumor mongering of my own, I'd have suggested that their competitors are behind some of these attacks in an attempt to do damage to the Monsanto brand.However, that puts the burden of proof on me.Even if true, that plan has backfired as Monsanto is the name that comes to most people's lips when they think about who makes GMOs.And they know the most hated brand of weed killer by name.That is actually a very powerful, if intangible asset.Think of this comparison: There is a brand of gypsum drywall manufactured by the USG Corporation (NYSE: USG ) called "Sheetrock".Drywall is not an especially exciting product and there are other companies that make it.In spite of that, many contractors refer to all of them as Sheetrock, which means the brand is at the front of those contractors' minds when they go to purchase materials.On the Home Depot's (NYSE: HD ) website, shopping for drywall panels by brand gives a list of 24 products.All but 2 of those panels have the word "rock" in them, because the competitors want to associate themselves with the leader.The same thing happens with other brands, too; nobody ever goes to a restaurant and orders a cola.They order "A Coke", as in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ).Or a Pepsi (NYSE: PEP ) if you like that better, but I'm sure you get what I mean.So it stands to reason that both farmers and home gardeners (perhaps thanks to all that fake news) now have Monsanto and Roundup on their minds when they are shopping for GMO seeds and weed killers.I talked about this in my article about " How To Identify Durable Competitive Advantages Instantly".The main precept of that article was on using a shopping trip to Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) to gauge brand popularity by how much of a percentage of a certain product section's shelf space was taken up by just one brand.I mentioned towards the end that I deliberately left one photo out of that article.Here it is: Yes, Roundup is far and away the best selling weed killer on the market.I knew that before I ever took a look at a single financial statement for this company.But let's do that anyway.Let me show you a few things that are going to get you more excited about what the leader in this industry is accomplishing.Quick, how many stocks can you name that have produced 18 times the return of the S&P 500 over the last 15 years?"Not many" is likely the answer.Even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), arguably the most discussed company on this site, has only produced about 16 times the index.And I would argue that what Monsanto will be doing 20 years from now would be a lot easier to predict than what Apple will be up to.Although, to be fair, Monsanto is a pretty different company today than they were 20 years ago.The history that Monsanto is known for as a chemicals maker is mostly not what today's Monsanto is now.Because the GMO part of their business was making so much money, the company has divested their prior chemical businesses to focus on just farming.The Monsanto we know today is essentially a spin-off of what they used to be.I think the fact that the manufacture of Agent Orange and DDT are in this company's history are a part of what frightens people today.Today's Monsanto operates in two segments: Seeds & genomics, and agricultural productivity.The products that Monsanto makes are crucial to feeding the population of the world today, and even more so moving forward.There are already 7 billion people in the world.The population is expected to reach almost 10 billion by 2050.Monsanto is producing disease and weather resistant crops that could potentially help make sure billions of people have enough to eat.A couple of my other articles as of late have been about what I think is going to happen in upcoming quarterly results.With Monsanto, I have more of an eye on holding and profiting from this company for a much longer term.I own shares now and they will probably be a permanent holding in my portfolio.And while the increase in share price over the last 15 years is most impressive, it's their growth in dividends that is a lot more exciting to me: That's close to a 1000% total increase in cash returned to shareholders every year.The S&P 500 has only grown its payout by about half that.In the last two years alone, Monsanto has increased their dividends by more than 14% per year.And here is the most amazing part.The stock is still cheap.Well, it's cheap if this is something you'd be willing to buy and stock away somewhere.Earnings per share have slowed down over the last five years, that should be addressed: The company has been investing in new biological technologies and buying back shares.They are expanding into new types of soybeans in South America, and they are especially proud of the work that they are doing in Africa .The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (unfortunately also another victim of far too much fake news) is funding major research with Monsanto into water-efficient Maize.Barring a major economic disaster such as a global war, a meteor crashing into the earth, or who knows, maybe the Yellowstone Caldera exploding, the population of the world is going to continue to grow, and they will continue to farm.As covered by The Mays Report right here on Seeking Alpha: Based on the company's mid-point estimate of earnings per share for fiscal 2014 of $5.17, Monsanto expects EPS in its fiscal 2019 of about $10.34.Monsanto closed the year with $5.22 in earnings per share, so they did even better than expected.If the company made their 2019 goal of $10.34, at today's multiple of 23 times trailing earnings, that is a price of $237 per share.A 197% increase on top of all of those dividends.Not a bad return for a little more than a four and a half year wait.Risks that the company faces are minimal.Obviously, the 22 other companies making GMOs that were cited earlier are a concern.Monsanto fortunately has patents protecting the seeds they are making, and a good head start over their competition, as they were among the first to create lab-modified plant cells all the way back in 1983.According to the 2014 annual report , other risks to the company are fluctuations in commodity prices and litigation concerns, but a competitor would likely be affected by the same issues, should any industry wide changes be made.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Moreover, if any of the catastrophic events described above actually did happen, then Monsanto's products would still be in demand.</span>People have to eat to live, and a damaged ecology would make hardier fruits and vegetables a necessary good.Fortunately, on the opposite end of the news spectrum, social media is also helping the public become smarter.Science is becoming cool now, thanks to sites like IFLScience.com .They published a great article explaining what GMOs are all about , and Monsanto is doing more themselves to improve brand awareness.They have a new consumer information site at discover.monsanto.com .I believe that Monsanto's stock will see even greater demand as more people come to understand what it is they actually make.All of this fake news has created the opportunity to own an amazing business at what is likely to be a bargain price, compared to what shares will cost in the future when the rest of the internet gets their information act together.I also understand that speaking positively about this company can be controversial.I am prepared to answer your questions in the comments section below.Source: Fake News You Can Use: Buy Monsanto, The 21st Century's
