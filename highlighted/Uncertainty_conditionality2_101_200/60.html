Thoughts After ROTH Conference - Resonant (NASDAQ:RESN) | Seeking Alpha Management is preparing investors for SkyWorks design rejection.Clarification on ISN and manufacturing processes indicate that RESN has no technological advantage.Agreement with second customer is to replace TC-SAW filters rather than BAW filters as initially stated.This means far lower monetization potential.Yesterday Resonant (NASDAQ: RESN ) presented in the ROTH conference .It was a usual spin of a bull story (multi-billion dollar pie and we just need a small bit of that) with the addition of the 'second customer' (which is not really a customer).However, there were a couple of interesting points: The company seems to be preparing investors for SkyWorks rejection of their design model, by repeatedly stating that cooperation with SkyWorks will continue and that they are supposedly working on other products.Basically, the same spin of "do not pay attention to what is happening now, because we are going to be great in the future."Even if cooperation with SkyWorks will continue after the filter design rejection, it is going to be on terms where RESN does all of the work and puts all the money and SkyWorks just keeps watching.Clearly, not a relationship RESN should be proud of.Management tried to give a bit of an explanation on what competitive edge their proprietary ISN is supposed to give, but instead ended up revealing that their ISN is close to worthless.It goes something like this.Mathematical models are generated and from these models possible circuit solutions are derived.This apparently leads to 'tens of billions' of possible solutions.All the other filter producers/designers get scared by this big number and do not try to innovate filters into different designs (I wonder if management believes this statement themselves).This is where ISN apparently comes in handy as it supposedly allows the company to hand pick a "few thousand of needles from the hay stack" and continue working on them.So the whole ISN is nothing more than selection methodology, far away from being anything that would give RESN an edge.And I can bet that other filter designers have their own selection models as well.Also, the press release on a 'second customer' talked about designing SAW filter for frequency that is currently workable only by BAW filters.However, in yesterday's presentation it clearly states, "SAW duplexer for high-volume, BAW/TC-SAW band."Mentioning of TC-SAW is crucial here as it reveals that the band involved is quite low frequency.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Also TC-SAW filters are far cheaper than BAW, therefore their replacement by SAW would not lead to far lower savings (if any) and lower potential licensing fees (if any).</span>This proves again that this new cooperation agreement is multiple times inferior to what the company had going with SkyWorks.No need for any changes in manufacturing (in terms of materials, process and equipment) for the filters that RESN is designing.While this might seem a positive from an easier production perspective, it clearly proves that RESN is doing nothing more that rearranging different filter components.Any true break-through filter innovation would require at least some changes in the manufacturing process.I was surprised to hear the company already has "their hands full with existing customers."They are working on only two filter designs and have 10 engineers for that and plan to hire another 10 on top.How can they be full already?And for the ending, I loved the honesty of the CEO: "In fact, we do not have any expertise.No real expertise" This was said in the context on filter manufacturing, where I would have expected RESN to have huge expertise if they are trying to come up with commercially feasible filter designs.Keeping in mind the high number of investor conferences (5 during the last 4 months), the secondary offering seems to be imminent.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap.Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.Source: Resonant -
