the Federal Reserve will create a headwind for Lennar.Lennar's cash from operations is negative and declining, while its short float is rising.The housing market, however, is expected to continue growing due to lack of supply in the market in recent years.Lennar's Next Gen offering will increase the company's margins as it carries a significantly higher average selling price than its overall portfolio.Over the past year, the NAHB/Wells Fargo U.S. Housing Market Index has appreciated an impressive 20%.This has helped homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: LEN ) outperform the S&P 500 by a decent margin over the past year since it has recorded strong growth in both revenue and margins as indicated by the following chart.Hence, it is not surprising to see that Lennar trades at the higher end of its 52-week range.But, can the stock deliver more upside going forward, or should investors consider booking their profits?Let's find out.New home sales data for the month of January was steady, which is an encouraging sign considering the harsh weather that was affecting certain parts of the country.In a recent article , NAHB (National Association of Home Builders) Chief Economist David Crowe said, "In a promising sign, new home sales have been trending at post-recession highs for the past two months."Moreover, according to Statista , new residential construction spending in the U.S. is expected to hit $526.7 billion in 2018 from $378.11 billion at the end of last year.This paints a positive picture of the housing market in the U.S. for the long run.However, there are some negative cues as well.For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to increase interest rates as early as June.Even though the home building market has been picking up in the U.S., along with robust employment data (with unemployment falling to a six-year low of 5.5% last month), an interest rate hike would curb the disposable income of buyers.This will create a headwind for homebuilders like Lennar.Apart from this, there are a few fundamental risks associated with Lennar as well.For example, the company's short float has been rising.When I last covered the stock, the short float was 15%, but it has now gone up to 18.8%.In fact, Lennar had 31.78 million shares short in February, up from 30.44 million shares short in the preceding month.LEN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts Hence, even though Lennar's revenue and earnings are growing, the company's cash flow is not in positive territory.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>As a result, if the Fed increases rates, Lennar might see a drop in home sales and this will lead to more weakness in its cash flow performance.</span>But then, the housing market's dynamics should support Lennar's growth in the future.Several years of production deficits have resulted in limited supply of both rental and for-sale properties in the U.S. Thus, any pullback in housing volume should be short-lived.US New Single Family Houses Sold data by YCharts As the above chart suggests, there have been less homes for sale in the last five years as compared to actual homes sold.This is a key reason why the housing market will improve in the long run.In addition, Lennar will benefit from its high-margin product portfolio.The company's Next Gen houses are selling at a price that's 23% above the company average, and they grew 38% in the last-reported quarter.As a result, Lennar now offers the Next Gen plan in 205 communities in 14 of its 17 states, and this will help the company improve its margins going forward.In addition, Lennar is improving its pricing strategy to maximize gains.Hence, the home builder has increased its average selling price by 7% year-over-year.Also, the rate at which construction costs have increased has slowed to 7% compared to 10% last year.This will compliment its price increases and have a positive impact on the bottom line.There are a number of risk factors associated with Lennar.However, investors should not ignore the positives either.The housing market is expected to get better in the long run, driven by the lack of supply in the housing market in recent times.In addition, Lennar's high-margin products, improved pricing and lower costs will help the company accelerate its performance going forward.Thus, even though Lennar trades close to its 52-week high, it is a good investment.Source: Lennar:
