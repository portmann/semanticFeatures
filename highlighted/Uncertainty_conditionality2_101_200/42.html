current price of oil does not warrant the purchase of electric vehicles.Dissemination of patents has cost Tesla its competitive advantage.By Ole Henrik Bang-Andreasen and Louis Copolov Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ), a car manufacturer that designs and produces premium electric vehicles, is on the verge of, what we like to call, "assisted suicide."In essence, the company, well known for producing the world's first fully electronic sports car, is metaphorically digging its own grave.It is in the process of expanding, despite the fact that the price of oil is continuing to decrease, and there are more and more cars coming onto the market that pose as direct competition.In addition, we would like to draw the public's attention to the fact that most people see Tesla as a technological company, as opposed to the high-end car manufacturer that it is.Finally, it must be noted that Tesla recently released most of its innovative technological patents, patents that ultimately form the backbone of the company, to the public.As more and more sustainable vehicles begin to flood Tesla's market, not as many people are buying into, what most people perceive, Tesla's niche.Additionally, a significant drop in the price of oil has fueled an increase in the amount of vehicles that run off of petrol and diesel to be purchased.On top of that, the US government does not appear as if it is going to reward those who purchase Tesla's expensive, environmentally conscious vehicles.Norway, a country well renowned for its commitment to environmental sustainability, promotes the purchase of electronic vehicles.According to an article published by National Public Radio , in the third quarter of 2014, Norway accounted for 12.5 per cent of all Tesla sales.Unlike the United States, Norway eliminated all taxes on electric vehicles, offered free car charging, parking, and allows electric vehicles to use lanes that are otherwise restricted.However, the Norwegian government only afforded such incentives to the first 50,000 electronic vehicles sold.Some time throughout the spring of 2015, this cap will be reached.When this happens, less people will be inclined to buy Tesla vehicles because the Norwegian government will no longer offer the said incentives.Consequently, Tesla vehicles could cost as much as 2.5 times more.Thus, such a profound change will ultimately lead to less demand in the European continent.When oil was at its most expensive in 2014, people were looking for vehicles that could provide cost effective solutions to petrol.Times have changed since then though, and the price of oil has decreased significantly (from approximately $115 per barrel in June, 2014 to $60 per barrel in March, 2015, as noted by Nasdaq's crude oil page ).The majority of the American population, therefore, are benefiting from the cheap oil prices and do not appear as if they are very interested in purchasing premium electric vehicles.For example, The Detroit News noted in January of 2015, General Motors' (NYSE: GM ) sales increased an astounding 18.3%.Similarly, Ford (NYSE: F ) posted an increase in sales; they were up 15.3%.In a world that is becoming increasingly environmentally conscious, this should come as somewhat of a surprise.The sale of Tesla vehicles does not necessarily demonstrate a complete shift toward a new fuel medium therefore, but rather an alternate solution.This is only further illustrated through General Motors' and Ford's latest sales.Instead of an increase in sales in the environmentally conscious vehicle market, more and more people are purchasing sport utility vehicles and other iconic fossil fuel consumers, like pick up trucks, for instance.When compared with sales reports from January of 2014, Ford's iconic F150 has increased 16.8%.By comparison, EVObsession , a website concerned with all things electric-vehicle related, explained electric vehicles increased a mere 9%, almost half of Ford's F150 sales increase.As such, it is obvious that society is not yet ready for a shift to more environmentally sustainable modes of transportation, especially if the price of oil continues its current trajectory.In an attempt to make it look like Tesla sales are improving, many believe the company is dialing back production.Despite this, Tesla is naively in the process of expanding its production facilities.At present, Tesla is building its Gigafactory.The Gigafactory, which is supposed to be operational by 2017, is intended to enable Tesla to produce its own batteries, tells the Reno Gazette-Journal .The release of Tesla's Gen 3 model, a low cost car that is supposed to appeal to the masses, due to its predicted $35,000 price tag, is supposed to change the direction of the company entirely.However, obviously there are a number of risks that are associated with this broad statement.Deductively, one must be mindful of the fact that Tesla's Gen 3 may not be well received by the public, and that its Gigafactory will suffer significantly as a result.Even with the construction of the Gigafactory, a factory that is supposed to profoundly reduce Tesla's car prices, financial analysts are still concerned that Tesla will struggle to demand meaningful market share.Monumental issues look set to ensue when Tesla fails to produce vehicles at a price that people are willing to pay, and the demand for electric vehicles looks set to go down.Moreover, they will be left with the cost of the Gigafactory, estimated at $5 billion, to worry about.In June, 2014 Tesla's chief executive officer, Elon Musk, decided to release Tesla's technological patents to the public.In an attempt to lure other car manufacturers into the electric vehicle industry, a move toward open innovation was made.Therein lies the problem, however.The process of disseminating their technological patents has since resulted in an increase in sales from other car manufacturers who produce electric vehicles."We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform," said Musk in a press release posted on Tesla's website ."Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world's most talented engineers.We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla's position in this regard."Financial analysts, however, do not see it this way.Many analysts reason that Tesla's move toward open innovation has ultimately cost them the competitive advantage that they have fought so hard to leverage.Moreover, we believe Tesla is an expensive buy given today's stock prices because Tesla's price to earnings ratio is 134.35 as of February 25, 2015, according to e24 , a Norwegian economic newspaper.By contrast, BMW AG's (XETRA: BMW) price to earnings ratio is 11.49 and Toyota Motor Corp's (NYSE: TM ) ratio is 10.72, as of the same date.To put these ratios in perspective, the major auto manufacturer industries' average price to earnings ratio is currently 12.70.In addition, Tesla's price to book ratio is well above that of other major automobile manufacturers.Tesla's price to book ratio is 38.35, while BMW AG's is 2.04 and Toyota's is 1.68.Both of these ratios render Tesla a very expensive buy when compared with industry averages.Until there is genuine evidence of sustained sales improvement, a drastic increase in the price of oil, or federal incentives, buyers should be wary of the slippery slope that Tesla is traveling upon.Even though we respect the fantastic work that the company is doing, we do not see their stock increasing any time soon, on account of the aforementioned evidence.As such, we recommend people sell Tesla stock while it is still over-performing, or reconsider buying the stock if they are at all interested.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72
