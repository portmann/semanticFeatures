Co Hefty Wastebaskets, Goldbug Inc.Carter’s Newborn Shoes, Ariela and Associates Smart & Sexy Bra, and Ziegenfelder’s Budget Saver Pops.So how does Walmart determine what products are produced by women-owned companies?It doesn’t –– that task is handed off to the Women’s Enterprise National Council and WEConnect International.Businesses that get approval from either organization can use the new logo.This isn�t the first time Walmart has tried to amp up its women owned-products.In 2011, the company pledged to buy $20 billion of products from U.S. female-owned businesses over the next five years.That initiative also includes training women to work in factories and retail around the globe.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Click to print (Opens in new window) Faith V.
