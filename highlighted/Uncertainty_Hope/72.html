Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article.Learn more about PRO � Recent spurt in transactions may be difficult to repeat, while fundamental concerns remain.Air ticketing business is already commoditized, competition in hotels & packages business is increasing and sustainable profitability remains elusive.Lack of significant value creation for shareholders and poor operating leverage may cap earnings growth, while large shareholders are reducing their holdings in the name.Since my last negative note on MakeMyTrip Limited ( MMYT ), the largest Online Travel Agency (OTA) in India, the stock is down a few percentage points, but more importantly fundamental story has only deteriorated and a closer look at the performance of both the company and the space suggest that investors might still be better served by monetizing the excitement, built upon reasons other than the core business, around the name, which is trading close to all-time high.More than the fundamental business, 'bulls' like to treat the stock as a premier play on the growth of Indian consumerism thus demanding a higher trading multiple and time to eventually grow earnings into high expectations.Fundamentally, the promise is that Hotels & Packages business will be able to deliver high revenue growth rate profitably, Air Ticketing business will benefit from expansion of Indian airline industry and the company can extend its market leadership by reaching tier 2-3 cities, while drawing lateral benefits from its scale in the travel industry, like investments via the new travel innovation fund started by the firm.It may be easy for the U.S. investors, but the stock does not look like a great way to play the Indian consumer story.Problems for the somewhat commoditized Air Ticketing business, which still makes up about 55-60% of the total revenue, seem to be continuing with high competition, consolidating airline industry and absence of transactions translating into revenues, at least proportionately.Hotels & Packages business, though a major growth driver, seem to be benefiting from weak hotel industry dynamics and favorable competitive conditions, both of which may not be as helpful going forward.Even otherwise, Hotels & Packages business alone may not be able to create enough value for the stock to live up to its current valuation of three times EV/ revenue, almost double that of established players listed in the U.S.The stock may come under pressure as investor expectations adjust for improving airline and hotel industry in India, which may not allow the service cost declines experienced recently, and lack of earnings leverage available, thus driving the trading multiple down.Seasonality, news flow around new well-funded startups and continuous selling by some of the well-respected large shareholders, as seen in the last few months, may further cap the stock gains from current levels.There are high expectations that major policy announcements to drive economic growth will be announced in the upcoming Indian national budget at the end of this month and this excitement has crossed over to stocks as well, offering a good opportunity for investors to monetize gains or enter fresh Short positions.Air Ticketing: Hardly any reason to shed a cautious stance Even after a good quarter, considering the transaction growth rate as well as seasonality, there are reasons to stay cautious about the long-term prospects of the business.Ticketing business has commoditized and intense competition, including from well-funded startups, may not let it change for a while.Some of these and other factors have been covered in the previous note.Recently, the business has benefited from decline in service costs, partly due to financial troubles at one particular domestic airline - SpiceJet.Financial troubles led to aggressive discounting via flash sales, which benefited travel agents.Since Service Cost is the cost of air tickets purchased as part of the special negotiated rates, intense discounting of tickets that led to a huge increase in transactions and revenues may not be as repeatable.Worth noting that revenue (excluding service cost) growth rate for the most recent quarter was back to 10%.After some high profile deals, including ownership change at troubled SpiceJet, the Indian airline industry is in a much better shape.Much of the market is now concentrated between half a dozen well-capitalized and professionally run airlines that may not go for aggressive price discounting seen in the recent times.At the same time, competition between OTA's is increasing with well-funded private competitors going for market share gains and the recently announced Google flight search option for India.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Hotels & Packages: Not strong enough to carry the weight of the firm Hotel & Packages offer the best and probably the only hope for long-term profitable growth of the company, but here again the market conditions that are leading to recent performance do not look sustainable or strong enough to carry the momentum for long.</span>Competition is increasing, average transaction value is declining and revenue growth rate is slowing down.Somewhat visible from the difference between revenue growth and the growth rate of revenue excluding service costs, the business has benefited from weak hotel industry dynamics due to weak occupancy rates, new capacity coming online and the sector adopting OTAs faster than ever.Going forward, competition, from the established OTAs as well a number of venture funded startups, may be one of the biggest threat to the profitability and growth momentum of the business.After ticketing, hotels have been high on the radar of travel Metasearch engines, which may further put pressure on the margins of the OTAs.Trivago, a travel Metasearch engine focused on hotels and owned by Expedia ( EXPE ), has already become aggressive with its marketing push in the Indian market.Although weak cash flows may reflect a lot, but even beneath the headline numbers, one has to struggle to find any significant value being created for the shareholders.Considering, even a well-respected management team not being able to create any major value for the shareholders does reflect a lot on the dynamics underway in the space.As the sheet above shows, on many financial metrics, the business looks more like a startup than a decade old business, while lack of operating leverage and dilution stand out among them.Street estimates are calling for 25-30% top line growth over the next year, which may not be as conservative as the rich stock may want us to believe, especially considering the dynamics discussed above and the strong U.S. dollar.Over the past few months, Indian Rupee has been among the strongest currencies in the emerging market basket and any change may put the estimates at risk.Excitement around Indian stocks, strong growth in transactions and benefits from financial troubles at domestic airlines has helped the stock hold up well, but fundamentals suggest that the underlying weakness in the business is still prevalent.Recent improvement in ticketing business may be difficult to repeat as consolidated airline industry avoids aggressive discounts.Even a strong transaction growth fails to show proportionate improvement at the earnings level.Hotels & Packages business is performing well, but the business alone may not be able to deliver for the shareholders and doubts over the sustainability of the current momentum are getting louder.Trading multiple may also come under pressure as airline & hotel industry stabilizes and the stock discounts currency and competitive risks.Estimates do not seem conservative, the shareholding is concentrated among few large shareholders and some of the well-respected large shareholders have reduced stake recently.Overall, the business may not be the best way to play fast growing Indian consumer story.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author
