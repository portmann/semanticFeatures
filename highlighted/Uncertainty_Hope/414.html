today.2014 was a pivotal year of repositioning, rebranding, and investing.During the year, we accomplished great things to set the stage for capturing the growing interest in the conception of content rich digital media.I am excited to discuss our strategic progress with you today, and talk a little about how we believe it will help us continue to create shareholder value in the future.During 2014, we developed and launched a global media services platform, which offers our customers a global single point of contact for handling any media, preparing it and delivering it to any screen, anywhere in the world in any form of video consumption.This platform is exactly what our customers are looking for, especially our larger customers who are seeking efficient ways to manage the growing libraries of content, increasingly in the cloud and give consumers access to this content on a growing array of screens.Our focus on investment in our global media services platform in 2014 positions the company to meet the new complexities for content management and distribution required by our customers.The trend for converged hybrid end-to-end service solution continues.This platform was a result of the acquisition of JCA during 2013 and other investments made in our content management offering.To that point, we made significant investment in our offering and expanded our geographic presence in 2014, while successfully completing the integration of our SM2 and JCA acquisitions.These acquisitions not only lauded out our content management offering but also provided us with local expertise in key media markets.SM2 gave us the presence in the United States and JCA in London.By expanding our content management capabilities, we are a more valuable partner for our customers and are able to further penetrate our existing customer's base as customers ask us to do more work for them on the content management side.With these immense capabilities, we have seen nice increase of business coming from our upper tier customers.These customers include commercial, government, and religious broadcasters have increased the business with our media from being 28% of our revenue in Q1 to becoming more than 33% of our revenue in Q4 this year.In addition, a range of new opportunities have emerged for our media, increasingly Tier 1 customers are discussing much larger projects with us, while we have not yet won any of these significant opportunities, I am encouraged with the ongoing dialogue.During 2014, we have secured several unique content management projects, including in these were, we completed our first 4K restoration project to bring the Alfred Hitchcock classic, Jamaica Inn, back to its former glory.The film was then screened at the Cannes Film Festival which was well received.This is a prime example of why 4K is a technique that will be used repeatedly for future projects.We signed a three-year contract with DOCtv wherein we provide the full range of extended media services including content preparation, management, playout services, and global distribution.And then there is the work we perform for British Pathe, the world's leading multimedia resource.We reformatted and delivered one of the largest archive of historic audio-visual content to the online video platform YouTube.This great effort of successful content repurposing was recognized in October at the TVB Europe awards in London, winning the achievement in legacy content awards.With over 85,000 pieces of video content, the archive contains footage from some of the most significant moments in 20th century history.Audiences can now access 3,500 hours of their high-resolution content on any device for free on YouTube, providing an enhanced overall user experience.We also made great strides in expanding our offering in the sports and live events by integrating the state-of-the-art capabilities we gained through acquisitions with our existing capabilities.RR Media began 2015 by delivering the Super Bowl to the world.This was the third season that RR Media successfully distributed their Super Bowl as well as the NFL's regular season and playoff games.We delivered this event in HD, live to Asia and Europe to our smart global content network, what we call other [ph] world in our portfolio of solutions.According to Nielsen, this year's Super Bowl was watched by an estimated 120.8 million viewers in the U.S. with the Super Bowl also available for viewing in 230 countries and territories worldwide with an estimated 60 million viewers.We were excited to be a significant contributor to this event.In addition, we partnered with EBU, the provider of the largest live sports delivery platform to broadcasters worldwide to carry [indiscernible] of the World Cup over the Asian footprint of EBU's Eurovision network.We are also now partnering with Premier League Football Club, making RR Media the delivery partner for the weekly Arsenal media programming to millions of households.And our partnership with Fox Sports International and the PGA Championship continues as well.Sports teams and leagues are increasingly seeking ways to reach consumers through new channels including the internet and mobile platforms.Sports and live events media services is a growing industry segment valued at 5 billion in 2014 according to U open South, and [this families] expect the industry to grow to $7 billion in 2022.There are several reasons for this.First, there is the growing global demand for sports content, especially as more and more live events are broadcast in high definition, both high definition and and online.Second we're seeing wider coverage of sports events in different regions with larger international audiences.Finally, there is increasing demand for professional complementary sports content like highlights, different camera angles, data feeds, statistics, and the like.Our mediaâ€™s unique sports offering covering the full range of digital media services, taking content from the camera to the viewer, we can help these sports teams and leagues take a game footage, interviews, and other digital media and prepare it to be distributed in any format to any device in multiple languages.Our unique optimized global distribution network is tailored for sports like holder's league, federations and channels.We prepare fully manage and deliver 24/7 sports broadcast channels that incorporate live content to leading customers like NBA Premium TV, Fight Sports and like.As audience and viewing habits evolve our media is ideally positioned to handle the complexity of this growing sports media landscape.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This portion of our business is a key growth opportunity to our media and I am increasingly confident with our strategic positioning.</span>All in all a successful year for the sports and live event portion of our business with ALP double digit growth in revenue compared to 2013.Sport and live event is not the only reason that I am increasingly optimistic about our future.The board of TV is changing Forbes recently listed 10 companies that are changing the TV industry and our media was prominently on their prestigious list.Let me elaborate on this important position.Viewers are increasing the number of hours they watch video on different screens according to Nielson the average American is watching four and half hours the video every day.This is expected to significantly grow with video on demand consumption leading the trend.As the number of hours of video watched per day increases the challenge for content owners, broadcasters and channels is to prepare and manage this VOD content for different platforms for different performance, multiple screen sizes resolution and meta data that are required.Our media is ideally positioned to simply this process due to our experience in preparing, managing and delivering millions of hours of video content every year for both linear and VOD platforms.With advanced workflow and certifications for the leading VOD platforms like Netflix, iTunes, YouTube and more we already handle this complexity flawlessly to deliver content to any platform or any screen and in any format.For example our media provide MTV & Nickelodeon, Digital Media Services supporting the broadcast TV as well as preparing and managing thousands of video hours for months to many different VOD platforms as VOD viewers increases we expect more and more customers to acquire our services.In short the plans to a mobile viewing and streaming both represents key growth drivers for our differentiated services.We have positioned our media in the sweet sport for the industry.Another trend benefiting our media that I'd like to briefly touch on is the increasing outsourcing of media services basically as the complexity of content management and distribution goals we are seeing more broadcasters and content owners outsourcing services as a growing business model.The reason for this is the need for broadcasters and content owners to remain focused on that and what they do best which is in creating and marketing winning content.Our media is one of the select few global vendors who can provide this outsourcing need and the changes we have made in the last 18 months has significantly broadened our capabilities especially in the content management area to make our media more and more attractive potential partners for these content providers.This trend will continue and we expect our media to get its fair share.As our media we fully prepare and manage 160 broadcast channels and millions of hours of VOD and online video content every year a course of smart global distribution network we also deliver and manage hundreds of thousands of hours of live content every year.We are investing and expanding our virtual services infrastructure to support this managed service and outsource model trend as broadcasters and content owners look to outsource their media operation, RR Media has expanded its capabilities to handle and fulfil this need for any type of customer.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Hopefully, this provides you with some color as to why we are so excited about the future; this was a successful and indeed a transformative year for RR Media.</span>I am very proud of the work accomplished by our team.And we accomplished all of this work all this while managing a capacity utilization issue in our network.Mid-year we experienced an higher than normal level of unutilized satellite capacity on our global network, resulting in higher capacity cost and lower growth incorporating margin a result of expanding our network resources to support future business on one end and terminating some customers with continued business issue on the other hand.This issue is formally and firmly behind us, expenses as we turn to normalized level and our margins are back in line with historic level as we exit 2014.Our focus now in 2015 is to expand our margin further, Shmulik will discuss that more in few minutes.In order to best communicate our offering and capabilities to the commercial market last September, we launched a comprehensive rebranding of the company starting with the International Broadcasting Convention, IBC.The largest trade show in our industry.This rebranding is the combination of our effort over the past few years to expand our service capabilities and create a truly converged offering which is directly aligned whether to end within our industry and the industry and the media are taking note.As I mentioned previously, Forbes Magazine named RR Media one of the Top 10 companies changing the industry.Validating alignment of our end-to-end service offerings with the key to trends in the industry.On February, we announced that this process was completed with the formal change of our corporate name from RRsat Global Communication to RR Media and the change of our ticker symbol to RRM.With our business offerings squarely aligned with market demands specific growth opportunity identified and rebranding of our company, the Board adopted a new dividend policy during 2014, under the policy the Board has approved a fixed rate of $0.07 per ordinary share each quarter.The change was made to enable investors to more accurately estimate future dividend yields.All-in-all, 2014 was a productive and successful year.As we enter 2015, we are continuing our quest to support the growing interest in any kind, anywhere consumption of digital media with a comprehensive offering and an increasingly larger global footprint.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I am increasingly confident in our global media services platform, which continues to drive customer interest as we move it upstream to more advanced content management services.</span>In addition, we continue to focus on scaling up our business both organically and non-organically and increase shareholder value.Thank you, Avi.First I will provide some detail about the quarter's results and then I'll discuss the full year results, after that we'll open the call for Q&A.Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 totalled $32.8 million compared to $32.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of 1% year-over-year.Foreign currency exchange rates had incremental impact on approximately $550,000 above and beyond the impact in the fourth quarter last year, as currencies continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar.In addition, the first quarter of last year was the first quarter with the full revenue contribution from the JCA acquisition creating a more challenging comparison?Breaking our revenues down by business units, content management distribution services revenues were $29.9 million, up 1.6% compared to $29.5 million in the fourth quarter last year.Non-core Mobile Satellite Services or MSS revenues were $2.9 million, down 4.6% compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter last year.As a reminder, our MSS business remains stable and profitable, but does not generate the same growth rate or margin profile as our core Content Management and Distribution Services business.The increasing revenues in our Content Management Distribution Services segment was driven primarily by growth in content management and preparation services, our sports and live events and our core 24x7 permanent services.Our fourth quarter revenues breakdown by geography was 42.5% in Europe, 27.5% in North America, 11.8% in Asia, 8.2% in the Middle East excluding Israel, 6.1% in Israel and 3.8% in the rest of the world.Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3.8% of our revenues and the 10 largest customers contributed approximately 22.5% of our revenues.Gross profit was $7.9 million in the quarter, up from $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year.Gross profit of our content management and distribution services revenue was $7.6 million or 25.3% and gross profit margin compared to gross profit of $7.3 million or 24.7 gross profit margins in the fourth quarter last year.This demonstrates that we have fully put capacity utilization issue behind us and our gross margins are now exceeding historical levels.MSS gross profit was $304,000 or 10.5% gross profit margin compared to gross profit of $313,000 or 10.3 gross margin last year.The increase in gross profit and associated margins is a result of our continuous efforts to efficiently manage our network capacity utilization and progressing changing our product mix to include more value-added services, a higher mix of sports and live events and better leverage of our infrastructure.Overtime we believe these efforts will help us improve gross margins even more.In summary we said we expect the sequential improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarters as the steps we described took hold and we delivered on the promise.Taking a look at our operating expense, total operating expenses were $5.8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $5.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of last year and compared to $5.7 million reported last quarter.Our non-GAAP operating income excluding non-cash stock-based compensation amortization of acquisition related intangibles and better derivatives consideration effect of acquisition, amortization of acquisition related to prepared compensation expenses and reorganization expenses, but inclusive of foreign currency impact was $2.2 million during the quarter compared to $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year and $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2014.On a sequential basis operating margins improved by 15.8% compared to 5.7% in the third quarter of 2014.The shekel to dollar exchange rate had an appropriate [$270,000] impact on taxes as the company pays taxes on a shekel denominated profit and not a dollar denominated profit, decreasing the reported GAAP and non-GAAP net income and net income per share.The taxes paid in the fourth quarter was $400,000 compared to tax benefit of $106,000 in the fourth quarter of last year.Inclusive of the tax impact I just mentioned net income on a GAAP basis was $1.5 million for the quarter compared with $2.1 million for the same quarter last year and $1.2 million for the third quarter.Non-GAAP net income totalled $1.7 million compared to $2.4 million for the same quarter last year and $1.3 million in the third quarter.Non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share totalled $0.10 per share compared with $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.07 per share in the previous quarter.Finally, our adjusted-EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2014 totalled $4.3 million compared to $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $4.2 million in the previous quarter.Turning to the full year results, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014 revenues were $131.2 million in line with our full year guidance of $129 million to $134 million.Year-over-year revenues were up 7.7% compared to $121.8 million for the same period in 2013.Gross profit and gross margins for the full year were $30.1 million and 22.9% respectively compared to $29.5 million and 24.2% respectively for 2013.Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin were $8.2 million and 6.2% respectively for the full year compared to $9.9 million and 8.1% respectively in 2013.GAAP operating income was $7.2 million compared to $8 million in 2013.GAAP operating margin was 5.5% compared to 6.5% in 2013.Non-GAAP net income for the 12 months period was $6.1 million, a decrease of 26.5% compared to $8.3 million in 2013.Non-GAAP net income per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.35 compared to $0.47 in 2013.GAAP net income was $5.2 million compared to $6.5 million in 2013.GAAP net income per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.29 compared to $0.37 in 2013.Adjusted-EBITDA was $17.2 million for the full year of 2014 down compared to $18.7 million in 2013.Backlog of services to be delivered in the next 12 months to that $86 million as of December 31, 2014 essentially unchanged from both the year-ago period and the prior quarter.We lost approximately $4 million of backlog due to foreign currency exchange headwinds.We expect to recognize these bookings as revenue during the next four quarters.Our total backlog which include all sign agreements to provide all the company's broadcasting services and mobile satellite services was approximately $195 million as of December 31, 2014 compare to $203 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 and compared to approximately $200 million as of previous quarter.Cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities as of December 31 2014 totalled $22 million compared to $24.2 million as of December 31, 2013.Our current ratio as of December 31, 2014 remains healthy at 1.83 and our shareholders' equity remains constant at $80.9 million representing approximately 63% of our total balance sheet.We generated $2.7 million in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014.Let's discuss our dividend the board of directors adopted a new dividend policy during the fourth quarter of 2014.Under the policy and subject to the board discussion and approval each quarter the board expects distribute fixed dividend to shareholders at the end of each calendar quarter equal to $0.07 per share.The change to a fixed rate policy from the prior policy of distributing 50% of net income was done in an effort to attract yield focused investors and enable investors to more accurately estimate future yields.The yields, as of today is approximately 3.9%.Consistent with the policy the board approved and authorized payment of a cash dividend in the amount of $0.07 for ordinary shares and in aggregate an amount of approximately $1.2 million.The dividend is to be paid on March 25, 2015 to all the companies' shareholders of record at the end of the trading day on NASDAQ on March 9, 2015.In addition as announced on October 2014 the board authorized the share repurchase program of up to $5 million of ordinary shares.At the current valuation the boards continues to believe that the share repurchase program reflects a solid opportunity to create shareholders values and demonstrate attractive returns.During the fourth quarter the company repurchased 18,517 shares for total purchase of $146,000.Finally let me turn to our expectation and financial guidance for 2015.As announced in today's earnings release we expect the full year 2015 total revenues to be in the range of $135.2 million to $139.2 million representing growth of approximately 3% to 6% compared to 2014.Keep in mind the industry has been growing at approximately 3% for 2015 we are adding guidance regarding profitability; this is due to near term focus on margin expansion which we expect to drive incremental profitability.We expect to improve gross and operating margins and we are targeting adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million to $20.5 million representing 14% to 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA.The outlook reflects organic growth and does not account for any potential acquisitions.Our caution is that we continue to expect some level of variation mix from quarter to quarter leading to some fluctuations in revenue and gross margin between quarters.You mentioned the backlog as flat because you've lost about $4 million due to the currency fluctuations, could you just talk about that a little more and also given that this foreign currencies hurt you in the last few quarters, how you see that playing out over the next few months?Thanks.Our backlog is flat mainly due to the loss of backlog due to currency fluctuations, mainly euro to dollar.As you all know, euro/dollar went down from 135 or 137 to 114.It has an effect on our revenues, and so it has an effect on our backlog.I cannot predict, I just don't have the skills to predict what will happen to the dollar and the euro, but I think it's probably a record low for the exchange rate in the last probably 10 to 15 years, I don't recall another low as it is today.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Hopefully, it will stabilize and we won't see any reduction in currencies further in 2015.</span>Just to answer your question about the backlog and softness, I want you to take into consideration that we are only inserting contract -- long-term contracts into our backlog, and as of today, over 78% of our business is just not backlogable, it's a short-term contracts that we don't take -- just 72% is backlogable, 28% is un-backlogable and all the increase in sports, concert preparation, and everything we're doing with VOD, all the new services are just not long-term contracts and are not being part of backlog.John, this is Avi.Thanks for question.There is one other comment and I know you know that is that the total backlog, which is not the next 8 to 12 months, we need to remember that it fluctuates a little bit based on the average contract length period, and that varies if it goes down from 25 months or 32 months, you can see sometimes backlog going down a bit, this is beyond what Shmulik was talking about, and yet from a revenue standpoint on a quarterly or monthly basis it is not quite there.So it's a little more complex equation of how this backlog plays, and I know you know that, but I just wanted to mention that.And if I could ask a follow-up, as you now reposition yourself and you're moving forward with quite a strong balance sheet, all your guidance assumes no acquisitions.Could you discuss the acquisition market involvement to sort of what are the interesting areas and what are the kind of multiples people are asking?It's a fair and valid and great question, I am not sure Iâ€™m able to answer, but I'll tell you it varies John.A lot of it has to do with things that are not necessarily [real] parameters and real measurable things .I'll give you an example, and again I know that you're aware of it, if you try to do acquisition in the new media business, these companies believe that they should [indiscernible] and they should be receiving multiples that are completely unreasonable in our belief, right.On the other hand, those companies have no capabilities and abilities in the world of broadcasting; they are more IT oriented companies.Yes, if you look at our business, the more traditional broadcasting business which we now still have a fair part in it, although a lot of what we do now is the new area, that business again if you're not large enough and if you don't have a global network, then you'll not receive a reasonable multiply.So, what is the reasonable multiply?I don't think it's what we are traded at, I think we traded at a low multiple, a big -- you can buy smaller companies in about what we are traded at or even maybe a tiny bit lower, but overall I think if you find a reasonably profitable company, there is enough scale as the kind of capabilities that we have, it's probably -- you probably are not going to pay less than seven, okay on EBITDA; again if talking about a small company, we'll pay less.So, I don't know, I answered the question, it's not accurate, but it gives you a little bit of feel for it.And we continue to look, as we really believe that the market is really waiting, interested in seeing some consolidation, we're talking to a lot of parties.But as always -- we always were and we'll continue to be bit careful because buying is easy, making it work is a little harder.So far, we've been able to make our acquisition work really well, we would like to continue in that record, we're looking at many things and we do know that that's an important part of our strategy, and when the right time we'll let everybody know what's going on.This is Louie DiPalma on behalf of Jim Breen.You guys acquired JCA in September of 2013; I was wondering what would you estimate was your organic growth rate in 2014 when taking into account JCA and the foreign currency effect?I don't know, I am not sure I can even answer the question because Louie thanks for the question, but I am not sure I can fully answer it.First, because we don't track it, we did full integration, the PMI that we did ended long ago.We have added business into that facility.We have reorganized it; we have integrated it with what we do.It's really hard to separate it now and say how much was what?We are bundling the acquisition services with additional services we had in the past.So whatever I will do will be a nice guess, that we have to take in to account some estimates about, so what if we didn't acquire then what would have happened to the original business.Would it grow that much or would the fact that we get more business from Shine International now, the fact that we do with Shine some other things.I don't know how to answer it.Look I believe that this is an interesting -- this is a very excited industry when you come and you expand your footprint, you expand your portfolio of services, the customers want to do more.And is the more coming from A, B or C how to tell?It's probably coming because you can do all of them.So it's a difficult question to answer unfortunately.Okay, and in addition to the rebranding investments, where there any other one-time costs in 2014 that will help adjust to EBITDA to grow faster in 2015 versus 2014?I am sure I understand the question about helping the adjusted-EBITDA growth.We did have some other one-time cost like the reorganization expenses which we have lined out in our press release.I am sure it will help the growth I don't know how, but let`s say, our EBITDA growth forecast for 2015 are built into our plan and this is something we are taking a major focus on, improving margins, reducing costs, increasing our revenues in order to make the guidance numbers.Great, and lastly one of your top competitors Globecast they recently completed a reorganization, do you expect that to result in any differences in the competitive environment?I don't think so Louie, I don't think so.I think I am very -- we are very -- as you can imagine we are familiar with them, with their business.They are a good company, but as far as we know and we can tell over the last few years their revenues has been going down.They have -- if you think about our capacity in Q1 our capacity issue theirs is lot larger, their commitment on capacity has been always much larger than ours because of sign and this market is changing faster than they can imagine.So I think the reorganization -- if you ask me but I could be wrong is probably a result of needing to adjust the whole bunch of issues that are associated with the fact that they are now growing in cost rather than something that is a growth engine of any kind.So that's my take on what's going on.I don't think it will change things in the marketplace.They are in some cases very strong competitor especially in certain areas, and some other areas we win quickly and we have been able to take some business from them over the last year.We have gone.I don't think they have gone; [indiscernible] that's my opinion although they are not public company, it's hard to tell, but we know the industry and we know what's going on.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So hopefully that gives you some flavor.</span>And we have no further questions at this time.This concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference.We appreciate your participation.And
