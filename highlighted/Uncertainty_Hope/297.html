(NASDAQ:KERX) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 10, 2015  5:00 AM ET �|� About: Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX) by: Early Retiree Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article.Learn more about PRO � Much has been said about Keryx and its phosphate binder Auryxia, but the most important argument has been missing in the discussions so far.In fact, scientific studies have shown that using the drug could lead to enormous potential savings.The sum of these savings could easily surpass the company's current market cap - annually.This clear indicator of undervaluation is further supported by the likely prescription growth trajectory and additional foreign sales opportunities.Different methods of bargain hunting Certainly the dumbest way to hunt for bargains is to filter stocks with low price/earnings ratios or, even worse, with high dividend yields.I suppose that most of my readers know that.There are many smarter ways, like looking for stocks with consistently high returns on capital, consistently high cash flows and much lower net income, etc.However, the really smart ways involve processes which cannot be done mechanically.These require thorough research, a mental framework of business thinking (as opposed to stock trading), judgment, time and the ability to project business dynamics into the future.The information that is out there about a business are the dots.Yet only the lines between the dots - i.e. knowledge - create a complete picture.Much has been written about Keryx (NASDAQ: KERX ), the amount of information available is huge, but only if an investor connects the dots correctly, (s)he will discover the bargain.A few good overviews of Keryx have been published here on Seeking Alpha and a lot has been written about this company even elsewhere.Basically, with its only product, the phosphate binder Auryxia, it is a one-trick pony.Usually, the discussion between bears and bulls is based on different opinions about the solidity and durability of Keryx' IP, the effective advantages of Auryxia compared to other phosphate binders, its competitiveness (given the likely or less likely arrival of generic competition for the current market leader Renvela), the iron overload warning on its label and even the company's chances to market the drug effectively, given that it has zero experience as a commercial organization.I will address these points later on, probably without adding a lot of new arguments to the usual bear-bull debate.So let me first address the one point I haven't read anything about so far - and I believe it is the most compelling argument for the stock that has ever been made.We know that, differently from all other phosphate binders (approved and, as far as I know, even under development), Auryxia also increases iron stores and thereby helps to reduce IV iron that almost all dialysis patients need, as their disease makes them anemic.This is the undisputed key-differentiator of the drug which even the bears agree with.Moreover, even pre-dialysis CKD patients often need IV iron, but most of them are untreated because there is no comfortable way to increase their iron stores.These patients would need to go to a clinic to get IV iron as well, but generally choose not to do it as long as possible.In the US, Auryxia is currently approved only as a phosphate binder for dialysis patients (which are about 450,000 in the US alone and 2.5 million worldwide).Pre-dialysis patients that suffer from iron deficiency anemia are about 3 times as many and Keryx is trying to expand the drug's label so that it could be used even for the pre-dialysis population.During a recent investor presentation , Keryx stated that the use of Auryxia can significantly reduce expenses for public and private healthcare systems.Depending on which parameters are considered, these savings can reach from $2,000 up to $4,000 per dialysis patient and year.In effect, the substitution of all or part of IV iron with oral iron is not only more comfortable for the patient, but it also reduces costs.This is not due to the iron which is not anymore added to the intravenous drug cocktail injected during dialysis (it is included in the "bundle" payment anyway), but mostly due to time saved by assistants and doctors, less potential complications (infections, cardiac disorders) and, as a consequence, less hospitalizations.These savings were calculated in a series of studies presented by well-known nephrologists at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2014 annual meeting in Philadelphia, PA from November 11-16, 2014.There were also two publications on the same subject in different scientific journals.Here is an overview of one of these studies which demonstrated that hospitalizations for Auryxia (ferric citrate) patients could be reduced by a stunning 24% compared to the active control group, treated with the current standard drugs Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) or Phoslo (calcium acetate): Based on average hospitalization costs of $20,795 per stay, the average potential cost savings for Auryxia patients would reach $4,173 per patient per year.Additional potential savings are mentioned in the second study which finds out that Auryxia patients would probably need less drug injections and also a slightly lower number of dialysis sessions, leading to another $1,200 of potential savings per patient per year.Now, under the (unrealistic) assumption that Auryxia was used for the totality of US dialysis patients, the total cost saving potential would be a minimum of 450,000 x $2,000 = $0.9 billion per year and a maximum of over twice as much.As I said, this assumption is obviously unrealistic.Not all patients will use Auryxia, some will have some specific intolerance or other reasons to switch to another drug.But then there are another 2 million dialysis patients worldwide.(According to its license terms with the licensor Panion, Keryx can sell Auryxia in most parts of the world, excluding certain Asian-Pacific countries.)And then there are the 7-8 million global iron-deficient pre-dialysis patients.Some of these will already be treated in the US (off-label) with Auryxia and, if the label gets expanded in late 2015 for the treatment of pre-dialysis patients (which I believe is very likely), their number will increase substantially, considering that Auryxia represents a very comfortable way to treat iron deficiency and that these patients are already treated by the very same doctors that usually prescribe phosphate binders.Now we might argue about the fact that healthcare spending abroad is less than in the US and hence even the potential savings.We might also argue about the potential market share of Auryxia and the savings it might effectively produce.However, you don't need a precision balance to understand whether you can drive a bike across the Golden Gate Bridge.Well, the whole company currently trades for $1.3 billion.Even presuming only a 20% global market share of the sole dialysis market, the minimum cost saving potential in the US and 50% of this abroad, we get the following results: So the whole company trades for about twice the potential cost savings its drug could produce each and every year under pretty pessimistic assumptions.In addition, we have not talked so far about the potential income from the pre-dialysis population of 7-8 million globally.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We could stop here and feel confident that Keryx is mispriced.</span>But there's more: The sole fact that these cost savings are possible should already help Auryxia to gain a large share of the market, given the notorious need to reduce healthcare costs all over the world.And with a larger share, the cost saving potential increases even further.I am pretty sure about this because "potential cost savings" in this case also mean "additional benefits for patients".As patients suffer less complications, hospitalizations, need to take less IV drugs and can take their medicines in a more comfortable and pleasant way, on the other side, payers save huge amounts of money.Moreover, while IV iron is included in the "bundle" rate dialysis providers receive, Davita, Fresenius and their peers are allowed to charge extra money for oral iron.So there is another strong incentive to switch to Auryxia even on the service provider's side.In his only TV interview, Berkshire Hathaway's deputy investment manager Ted Weschler said the most important point to evaluate when investing in healthcare was if the business under consideration delivered a specific health benefit (1) better than anybody else and (2) at a lower cost than anybody else.Without any doubt, Keryx checks both boxes.At its current cost, it is probably almost free or even more than free.Yes, I know, this feels strange.I am basically suggesting to buy a stock without providing an intrinsic value estimate, nor do I give a price target (yet).And it's even a biotech.It has only one drug.Some famous pundits have expressed their doubts about the company.The short ratio is high.Yet important nephrologists have done several studies certifying an enormous annual cost saving potential which could be realized by using Auryxia.This is no opinion, this is a fact and it has been demonstrated by scientists.The total amount of potential annual savings could come close to the company's current market cap or be even higher - without taking into account international markets and the still missing US-approval for pre-dialysis patients.(Which is likely, as it is already used this way in Japan and with a high probability even off-label in the US.)For me, this is as much a guarantee for success as there can be.There is no way Auryxia will remain a niche drug.It will have to gain substantial market share.It's in the interest of taxpayers and patients.And finally, besides all these benefits, the drug is also 11% cheaper than the current market leader Renvela.In October 2014, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued US Patent No. 8,846,976.The patent, which expires in 2024, claims a method of treating hyperphosphatemia comprised of administering a therapeutically effective amount of an orally administrable form of Auryxia to a subject, wherein the orally administrable form is prepared from an Auryxia active pharmaceutical ingredient having an intrinsic dissolution rate of at least 1.88/mg/cm2/min.In addition, U.S. Patent No. 8,846,976 contains claims directed to the FDA approved dosing and daily administration of Auryxia.This newly issued patent further enhances our key patent family, which includes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,767,851, 8,299,298, 8,338,642, 8,609,896, 8,754,257 and 8,754,258, which expire in 2024, and U.S. Patent No. 8,093,423, which expires in 2026, before patent term extension.Each of these patents contains composition and method of use claims covering Auryxia.(Source: 10-K ) - Will generic competition for the current market leader Renvela produce pricing pressure and ultimately force Keryx to sell Auryxia at a lower price as well?Ren Benjamin: And just as a follow-up, as you keep your eye on the horizon, any sort of color regarding generic Renvela or Renagel?Gregory Madison: We continue to monitor that carefully and thus far it's the same as we've been seeing in the past year, that the patent expired in September, so we're now got six, seven months post patents, and there has been no movement at all.In fact, one of the filers that's in there had their earnings call yesterday, and management team there quoted again, that how difficult a product this is to make.And they commented that them and their brethren, that just seems to be a very difficult product to make.And so it didn't look like at all there was any type of -anything pending in the near-term here.And so significantly for us it's not having any impact on our discussions with payers, having any impact on our ability to get in front of the Part D providers to get on the formularies, and we'll continue to monitor, but so far so good.(Source: Q4/14 conference call ) Even if a generic Renvela arrived, it would not increase iron stores and would not come for free or "almost-free" after factoring in correlated cost savings.- What about the iron overload warning on Auryxia's label?It seems that the iron increases are seen more as a problem than as a benefit.This is a total misunderstanding.The FDA had no other choice than to put that warning on the label, as the iron increase is absolutely new for phosphate binders.If a doctor was not aware of this, the patient would risk to increase iron both through Auryxia and IV iron up to dangerous levels.- What are the company's chances to market the drug effectively, given that it has zero experience as a commercial organization?The company has hired the man that years ago managed for Genzyme the launch of the current market leader Renvela.To me, this seems to be as much a guarantee for an effective launch as there can be.- What are you weighing as the bear scenario?Investors must be aware of the fact that Keryx' success depends only on one drug.While its safety profile has been found to be similar or even somewhat better compared to the current standard therapies, it has already happened in some cases that safety concerns came up long after a drug's approval.This does not necessarily lead to a permanent cancellation of a drug's marketing authorization, but may still cause severe financial damage, especially since Keryx does not have any other sources of income.Furthermore, while at this point in time there are no competing drugs in sight that would have the same combination of benefits as Auryxia, they might always appear on the horizon.In such cases, the stock market usually reacts very cautiously, meaning that it significantly reduces its valuation multiples until the picture becomes clearer.For these reasons, I have chosen to allocate only 50% of my usual position size to Keryx.According to recent conference calls, Auryxia seems to get a warm welcome from payers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The company confirmed to be on track to achieve the prospected payer coverage within a few months and is confident to be able to approximately match the usual 12 months post-launch prescription growth trajectory of competing phosphate binders afterwards: (Source: Keryx investor presentation) Based on the announced price of $4.21 per tablet, a daily dose of 8 tablets/day and a list price discount of 25%, Keryx should make net revenues of about $9,000 per patient and year.</span>To reach the consensus sales estimate of $315 million in 2017, within the next three years the company would need to acquire 35,000 patients, representing a US market share of under 8%.At this point, it should make the consensus EPS estimate of ~$1.09, putting its current forward P/E multiple to 11.4.Given the expectation that Auryxia will already acquire about 12,000 patients after the first year and the historical fact that most other phosphate binders have achieved about 30,000 patients after 24 months, I believe it is very likely that Keryx will surprise positively at the end of 2017 (i.e. 36 months after launch) and probably deliver far more than the estimated ~$1.09 of EPS.My belief is supported by a series of potentially incremental sales opportunities that might materialize over the next few quarters - and one is already pretty certain to materialize: the off-label prescriptions to pre-dialysis patients to contrast their anemia.Gregory Madison: Once the drug is approved, the clinician has the right to decide how they want to use it, on what type of patient population.So if a physician chose to write a prescription for somebody that has pre-dialysis today, the reimbursement scenario is consistent across dialysis and pre-dialysis.Meaning, once we get access to the formulary, the payers don't typically differentiate between a dialysis patient and a pre-dialysis patient.Jason Kolbert: So there is a good chance that we'll see some early use in that population.It's kind of foreshadowing data.Gregory Madison: Potentially, right.So I mean, today generally there is about 15% of phosphate binder prescriptions, at least what we saw with the experience at Genzyme, about 15% of the business was kind of off-label use in the pre-dialysis setting.I think realistically for us, you probably see relative consistency there overall, especially earlier on the launch.(Source: Q4/14 conference call) The other additional opportunities are represented by the likely EU approval (Q3/2015) and the also likely US approval for pre-dialysis patients.My central expectation for 2017 would be ~45,000 patients in the US and some additional royalties flowing in from abroad.With 45,000 patients (10% market share of the sole US dialysis market), Keryx should make over $400 million of sales and EPS of ~$1.74 - which would be further incremented by the international royalty income that could easily contribute another ~$0.30 by the end of 2017.personal estimate: 15% royalty on ~$200m foreign sales, representing another ~45,000 patients at ~half the annual cost of the US.The 15% royalty matches the terms agreed with Riona, the Japanese licensee.Given that the stock currently trades at ~$12-13, the undervaluation is obvious.But it is not much less obvious even based on consensus estimates - because the most important fact here is not to get the prescription trajectory right.It is to understand that a business which can save the world more than its market cap (each and every year!)must be successful.There is just no other choice.Within 2-3 years I see Keryx trading at $30 per share - and far more, if the US label expansion is approved and the company manages to launch the drug in other major markets.This would be my central estimate and would require only a market average P/E multiple of 15-16.Source: Keryx: The Company That Saves More
