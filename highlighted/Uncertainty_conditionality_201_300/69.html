earnings conference call.I am pleased to report another quarter of sequential and top line growth.The external market conditions that started affecting our nutrition business in the first half of the year continue to stabilize into fourth quarter.Despite the challenges we experienced in this part of the year, I am proud to say that we have a number of accomplishments across all our businesses.InFat, which is sold and marketed and by Advanced Lipids, our joint venture with AAK was launched in 16 new branded products this year and our proprietary bio-active ingredient Sharp-PS was launched in a clinical nutrition product.In VAYA Pharma, IMS data showed that our sales out operation grew more than 50% in U.S. which is better reflection of our growth.We initiated a number of clinical trials that will reinforce the science and expand the indication of our current VAYA Pharma product portfolio.And our [indiscernible] patent continued to grow.We settled the IP litigation with Neptune in final settlement and license agreement with a one-time payment which was not material to the Company and operator payments payment including royalties will be paid to Neptune unless the related patent positions with US PTO and the Australian Patent Office are unfavorable to us.Our gross margins also increased by more than 10% year-over-year, but most importantly also we experienced stellar headwinds throughout the year.We finished 2014 with adjusted EBITDA of $11.4 million and non-GAAP net income of $9.1 million, and remained cash flow positive.We are entering 2015 a stronger company and we will leverage our best in class lipids technology with the many growth opportunities we see ahead of us.We will continue to make authentic investments in the company in order to drive growth and ultimately shareholders value.Turning to review our individual segment let me first focus on our infant formula business.As we previously discussed, there has been a shift in the market in China in our infant formula result.The sales of infant formula continues to migrate to branded products on ecommerce platform from historical local brands in the supermarket and health stores.Advanced Lipids customers have been generally better positioned in local brand in supermarkets and health stores.Due to this shift to online sales the competition has intensified all our players, although the consumers are benefiting from lower prices, branded manufacturing are seeking to depreciate themselves in a crowded space.The shift to an ecommerce platform challenge the infant business in 2014, but as we look ahead we’ve seen that it may also create an opportunity for Advanced Lipids to gain market share and develop additional relationship with the branded manufacturing.Consumers are always in sales of the next in the best advancement and we believe that we are well positioned to provide a proprietary an innovative ingredient that we helped the brand manufacturing depreciate themselves from the facts and also value to their product.We also constantly researching and improving the supporting clinical data that are valuable to our partners their customers.We continue to see significant growth opportunities for infant part in China and behind.The 16 launches of new infant formula brand with InFat include launches not only in China but also in Europe, Mexico and Italy.We anticipated additional new launches in partnership in the years to come and we are always engaged in discussion with potential partners.We are establishing within Enzymotec Human Research Center with key opinion leader and research institute by leveraging our knowledge to date and plan to conduct addition research for infant nutrition including by using data mining tools.We plan to invest significantly in 2015 in sell developing several innovative ingredients and solutions for infant formula that we will be lot closer to resembling the composition and functionality of the human breadth sleep.We believe that our portfolio product under development sales with our technology and knowledge creates a value proposition and positions us a leading supplier for strategic partnership with infant nutrition companies, which we support the future growth of our nutrition segment.Moving on to bio-active business unit, the market demanding for omega-3 is statistically for Crim in United States and Australia were Enzymotec is dominated player were challenging decision.There is still over capacity in the market which is causing slightly pressure.But the Company's well positioned to withstand these pressure.We offer a far superior product compare to our competitors and with the efficiencies we are picking up from our new inflection facility we remind very competitive.We believe that with our improved margin structure and higher quality grade oil we will emerge as a market leader.With the support of the science, we constantly continue to explore new application for our krill oil to open to our customers.So on Enzymotec we have a leading technology supported by a strong portfolio of patents, which has enabled us continuously pioneer and introduce new product.Our strategy is to leverage our focus abilities across the businesses to fuel our growth opportunities.We then say we expect several penetrate the clinical nutrition arena.As we further explore this business, we see a lot of opportunities to advance our proprietary and innovative ingredients into a space that has required a new ways of innovation.The deprecation for quite some time, our proprietary bio-active ingredient Sharp-PS was launching a clinical nutrition product this year and this is just the beginning.We will continue to canvas this area and search for opportunities organically or through acquisition.We have strength in our senior management team in 2014 and with great pleasure and honor, Mr. Holger Liepmann has just recently joint our Board operators.Mr. Liepmann brings with him more than 35 years of international experience in the nutritional and pharmaceutical industry.With over 20 years of carrier spent at [indiscernible] in his part position as Executive Vice President of the Nutritional Product reporting to our CEO.His wealth of business knowledge and experience, his leadership skill industry conduct will be valuable to the Company in executing our strategy plan and expanding our global footprint.As we focus on our growth opportunities, we believe that VAYA pharma is growth engine for the Company.Robert Crim has joined us in 2014 as a President and CEO of VAYA Pharma.Having spent his carrier as a [indiscernible] Abbot and Johnson & Johnson, Rob brings with him wealth of knowledge of the nutrition market as well the healthcare industry overall.He has strong track record of delivering growth and managing the R&D pipeline.We look forward of drawing from his experience as we make the necessary investment in VAYA and build on strong platform with already have in place.Thank you Ariel.Good morning everyone.Let me first say how excited I am to be here and to be able to draw from my background in medical nutrition to build with exciting new business VAYA Pharma currently stands on solid footing with the products we have out in the market.The sales force we have in place are building the relationships with the doctors and the doctors are writing the scripts.The patients are also filling their prescriptions, which means they are receptive to the context and the doctors' advisement.As Ariel had mentioned earlier, IMS data shows that our sales out in the U.S. grew more than 60% in 2014, which is a better reflection of patients buying our product.We're also working on expanding the market opportunity within our existing product portfolio.We announced this year that we initiated a number of clinical trials to reinforce the science as well as develop new indications for our products.We initiated the study for Vayarin for adults with ADHD, a Vayacog long term study for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and a study for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.We also finalized the clinical phase of our study on Vayarol for patients with hypertriglyceridemia.We have a proven concept and we are committed to bringing these to market.To date investments in VAYA Pharma have been tempered in order to gain a better understanding of the market.With the encouraging information we have masked thus far, as we look into 2015 and as Ariel touched upon last quarter, we are committed to devoting additional resources in order to grow and expand on what we have built to-date.We have a foothold in the United States and elsewhere, and the concept has been proven with patients and doctors.We are investing and expanding the operation and infrastructure to continue this momentum and fuel what we expect to be a strong growth engine for the Company in 2015 and beyond.To support these efforts, we plan to double the number of sales reps this year.We want to have a more specialized and dedicated sales force with a reconfigured and attractive compensation structure that motives our people to succeed.The additions will allow us to expand our reach and footprint beyond the South East and Texas area where we are currently well positioned although we will stay concentrated in the larger cities.In regards to the online pharmacy, we just completed a pilot and expect to launch this quarter as expected along with the call center.With our own online pharmacy and call center we will have much better control of our supply chain and our costs and we will be able to leverage our contacts with our customers.We believe that the direct contact the pharmacy will have with the patients will be invaluable.As a background we will be increasing our presence at conferences as well as online.We will looking at key opinion leaders and there will be some targeted advertising.We’ve also built a foothold outside the United States.We established VAYA Pharma Singapore and are now marketing our branded products over there.We also have strategic partnerships that we developed with Teva in Israel and Daewon in South Korea.We believe there are opportunities for further strategic partnerships.With all of these investments, we hope to build on the success we have seen thus far.With a far superior margin structure compared to B2E business, we anticipate VAYA Pharma will be a greater contributor to the Company overall.Thank you, Rob.Before I start, let me remind you of some important information with respect to how we present our financial results.Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to account for the results of operations of Advanced Lipids, our 50% owned joint venture, using the equity method.This means that we recognize our share of the net results of Advanced Lipids as a share of profits of an equity investee.Accordingly the revenues recognized from the arrangement are the amounts we charge to our joint venture partner or our direct cost of production, plus our share of the joint venture profit.To provide investors with a better understanding of our performance and for the purposes of segment reporting under U.S. GAAP which requires presentation on the same basis provided to and utilized by our management to analyze the relevant segment result of operations, we account for the results of operations of Advanced Lipids using the proportionate consolidation method.Under the proportionated consolidation method, we recognize our proportionated share of 50% of the gross revenues of Advance Lipids and record our proportionated share of the joint venture’s cost of production in our statement of operations.And now let me discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2014.Based on the equity method of accounting, our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $10.8 million, compared to $18.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.Based on the proportionated consolidation method, our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $14.2 million compared to $24.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decrease of $5.3 million in krill sales volume driven primarily by decreased sales volume in the United States and Australia, specifically as a result of a decrease in sales of premium omega-3 products in those markets, as well as a decrease of $5 million in InFat sales based on the proportionate consolidation method, partially offset by increases in sales of VAYA Pharma products and PS products.Gross margin based on the equity method for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 10 basis points to 58.5% from 58.4% for the fourth quarter of 2013.Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2014 was impacted by one time disruption to production of approximately $0.2 million or 200 basis points related to damage to raw materials caused during production.General and administrative, expenses decreased to $2 million from $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to a decrease in patent-related legal expenses and due to non-recurrence of bonuses granted to certain company employees in connection with Enzymotec initial public offering in October 2013 that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as a decrease in share-based compensation expenses as a result of the acceleration of vesting of options in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the initial public offering.This was partially offset by an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts.Financial income increased to $0.1 million from a financial expense of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to a decrease in financial expenses related to the long-term loans that were repaid in January 2014, changes in the fair value of currency forward transactions which did not qualify as hedge transactions and interest income on the Company's bank deposits and marketable securities.Net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 decreased to $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share from $3.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year.Non-GAAP net income was $1.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $5.6 million, or $0.24 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013.Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2014 decreased 67.7% to $2 million compared to $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, but increased 15.4% compared to the third quarter of 2014.A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income is included in our earnings press release.I will now summarize the financial highlights for the full year 2014.For the year ended December 31, 2014, based on the proportionate consolidation method, net revenues decreased to $61.5 million from $80.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.For the year ended December 31, 2014, based on the equity method of accounting, net revenues decreased to $47.1 million from $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.The decrease was mainly due to a decrease of $15.8 million in krill sales, driven primarily by decreased sales in the United States and Australia, specifically as a result of a decrease in sales of premium omega-3 products in those markets, and a decrease of $4.6 million in InFat sales based on the proportionate consolidation method and partially offset by increased sales of VAYA Pharma products of $1.2 million.For the year ended December 31, 2014, gross margin based on the equity method increased 1,050 basis points to 61.1% from 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013.Approximately 680 basis points of the increase in gross profit margin were due to the operation of the new extraction facility and other improvements in production efficiency and approximately 370 basis points of the increase in gross profit margin resulted from changes in the mix of products sold, as net revenues for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014 reflected an increase in the volume of sales of InFat as a percentage of consolidated sales which when accounted for by the equity method carry a higher gross margin and drive an increase in sales of VAYA Pharma products, which carry a higher gross margin than some of the Company's other products.For the year ended December 31, 2014, selling and marketing expenses increased to $8 million from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of building the sales infrastructure of VAYA Pharma in the United States, in order to expand sales to additional states and also due to an increase in other marketing activities and license amortization expenses relating to the settlement and license agreement signed with Neptune.For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expenses decreased to $7.5 million from $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to a decrease in patent-related legal expenses and due to the non-recurrence of bonuses granted to certain company employees in connection with Enzymotec IPO in October 2013 that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as a decrease in share-based compensation expenses as a result of the acceleration of vesting of options in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to this IPO.This was offset by expenses related to the secondary offering in February 2014 and additional expenses relating to being a public company as well as an increase in allowance of doubtful accounts.For the year ended December 31, 2014, financial income increased to $0.5 million from financial expenses of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in financial expenses related to the long-term loans that were repaid in January 2014, an increase in interest income received and accrued on the Company's bank deposits and marketable securities and foreign currency exchange differences.For the year ended December 31, 2014, net income was $7.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $11.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013.For the year ended December 31, 2014, non-GAAP net income was $9.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share compared to $13.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013.Now moving to the balance sheet, as of December 31, 2014 we had $67.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and short-term and long-term marketable securities, and we had $29.3 million in other working capital items and we had no debt.Turning to our guidance for the full fiscal year 2015, we expect net revenues based on the equity method of accounting to be between $52 million to $60 million and net revenues for 2015 based on the proportionate consolidation method to be between $65 million and $75 million.We expect non-GAAP net income for 2015 to be between $5 million to $8 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.21 and $0.34.The projected non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS includes an operating loss of approximately $4.5 million or $0.20 earnings per diluted share from VAYA Pharma in 2015 as we intend to invest in expanding VAYA Pharma's operations and infrastructure as well as to conduct clinical trials to reinforce the science and develop additional indications for VAYA Pharma products.We believe that these investments will increase VAYA Pharma revenues in 2015 and reduce the time needed to bring the VAYA Pharma to profitability.Our guidance also reflects our investments in the development of innovative ingredients for infant nutrition that we believe will accelerate our growth of the Nutrition segment.As a reminder, non-GAAP net income represents net income excluding share-based compensation expenses and other unusual income or expenses.Non-GAAP diluted EPS are diluted earnings per share based on non-GAAP net income.With those comments complete operator please open the line for questions.(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Your line is open.Hi this actually David Lee on for Bryan.Good morning, Ariel you ended the year I guess with $67.5 million of cash and cash equivalent at the balance sheet.Given that your growth outlook is lower than when you in public, do you still need that cash and just wanted to see if you had any thoughts on returning it to shareholders?It's Oren.I'll try to answer your question.So you're partly right, as although initially when we filed or made our initial public offering, we planned on using the cash to build the new facility not only by the way for krill.We believe that following the completion of the organic expansion, that we are now currently doing in our facility and our existing facility, and that together with the production improvement that we are constantly doing, we will have enough capacity on hand to support our growth for the short term and mid-term.So we may use our cash on the balance sheet for exploring opportunities other opportunities, to accelerate growth in our core businesses, either organically or with acquisitions of complementary businesses of technologies.And currently we do not have any plan to return cash to investors or starting initiating buyback program.And I guess the next one is just on the guidance that you provided.Just wanted to see if you can talk to some of the segments within the context of your guidance.I think just trying to better understand what's embedded in it.So do you expect -- I just wanted to better understand when you either InFat or krill to return to growth?Is it sort of a steady sequential improvement through the year?And just if you can speak generally on the drivers of these two business and your expectations to the year.It's me again, Oren.We provided guidance that reflects growth for the company.Just remember that the first quarter of 2014 was our best quarter and then second quarter was much, much lower and then we add two quarter that we provided sequential growth.And our guidance for the next year as I said is considering growth in all our activities.We have not provided a breakdown and we are not going to provide a breakdown of where the growth is coming from, but in general, in the last two quarters we are seeing increasing multiple order businesses, including krill, InFAT and also VAYA, and as we have just mentioned in the guidance, we are going to invest a significant amount in VAYA Pharma including for marketing spending on the sales force but also for conducting clinical trial to reinforce our science and also for new indication for VAYA products.So we also expect growth coming from VAYA segment as well as from nutrition.Okay, and just on the VAYA investment, can we expect these investments to sort of be evenly spread through the year or is it kind of coming more in one part of the year and is there any way that you can also just give us a very sort of general expectation on when -- I guess 2015 is supposed the investment year for VAYA.Is there any way that you guys can give us an idea of when you expect that to be profitable?Is it ’16, is it beyond ’16?We do give this information, but as we described in our earnings call, we plan to double our sales force and we plan to invest in the infrastructure after building our confidence that this will be a growth engine.And at the beginning it's a big investment but you have seen in the past this is a very profitable business and when it starts to take off the profit of this business is high compared with other businesses and therefore we are quite optimistic within the medium term where we see not only high growth but nice profit from this business.I guess a few questions.First can you just clarify how much of an impact in the Q4 was the increase in doubtful accounts?So our G&A has increased by I think $400,000.Half of it is -- $200,000 is from an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts.Secondly in the InFat market, how many customers do you think you need to win or how do you look at the leverage to offset the share loss of VAYA’s volume?It doesn’t go by number of customers because the size of the customers are total different.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>So if we’ll able to win one of the big four, we will compensate and we will be far away from -- we will have a very nice growth.</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If we have a very local and some more branded, we need to have many customers to compensate, but since we are walking on all the types of the customers, as we said in our earnings release we believe that we will bring this business back to growth and we still have a lot of opportunities taking into consideration the InFat serving the premium brands and the current market share, the product like InFat require is only 50%.</span>So we still have 95% of total share growth.And in the krill market how are you -- can give a sense for inventory levels at your customers and actual competitors and are inventory levels still increasing quarter-over-quarter or have they flat lined?You have seen it in this quarter we’ve seen real improvement and we see that the top level is going down, and the business is taking -- the customers started again to order.But just to be clear, the inventory levels are down at your customers or are they just down for you?Okay, then just lastly when you talk about 2015 as an investment year, is the implication that investment -- the pace of investment should drop off in 2016, 2017 or is the strategy going to be that every few years or maybe every year we just see sort of a little bit more investment to support the growth?As I described -- our aim of the Company is to bring the Company as soon as possible to high growth and therefore we currently are focusing on two main segments -- three main segments that will bring us back to high growth.The first segment is VAYA.As we informed in our earnings release, or disclosed in our earnings release, we're going to have a real investment in this business in order to reinforce the infrastructure and expenditures cost and bring this Company to growth and we believe that later on, because it's very possible business, it's growth based on profit will be able to maintain the business and we will also need external investments to [indiscernible].Regarding InFat, we have strategy in place.InFat we see a lot of potential for growth because still small market-share -- relatively small market-share than the potential.But we also have a new innovative ingredient in these segment that will help not only to [indiscernible] the InFat sales but also to introduce new innovative products to the market, where it reach [indiscernible] and therefore we will bring to high growth and also we will not need a substantial or external investment from a company because the company will be off, the business will be much more possible and with higher revenue.And the second segment is we've spoken of the clinical nutrition, we believe that we have a lot of added value ended segment and as I said in my earning call, we thinking about one is advance this business organically but also the acquisitions and this also will help us to accelerate the growth.Thank you.Our next question is from the line of Scott Van Winkle from Canaccord Genuity.Your line is open.It's Mark Seagull for Scott.I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in a market to justify the stepped up investment in VAYA this year.Is it the strong sell out data?Are there conversations with insurers that perhaps have progressed positively?And then can you kind of bucket out the expenditures, perhaps as a total percentage of the incremental investment perhaps between the higher headcount, the advertising and an incremental online pharmacy costs?And then just to help us think about it, what’s the timing like of the hiring?Is it staggered throughout the year or does everyone kind of start at once and to get them all trained together?Sure.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I will try to take those in order there and if I forget any let me know for sure.</span>First of all, it is absolutely we’re seeing very positive results in marketplace as indicated by the IMS data, which show over a 50% increase year-over-year and then the sales out of our product.So that’s what gives us hope, more than hope, optimism and we certainly learned a lot in the meantime.In terms of the hiring, obviously a key part of that is we had a geographic footprint primarily in the southeast and Texas.We’re now expanding that primarily to large metro markets and big academic centers.So that’s a key part of the investment that obviously we’re doing in the first and second quarters.So we can hopefully see the impact of that coming through in the second half of the year.And in terms of total investment, obviously being a relatively small business and meaning to add primarily the sales folks but the infrastructure behind that to support them, roughly half of the expenditure is actually in the sales people and of course we got other marketing expenditures as well.You also asked about the online pharmacy piece.The online pharmacy at the end of the day is actually more -- will be a more profitable channel for us.So the investment there is really almost pays out as we go.So it's not significant investment.It is ultimately more profit for us as well.So I hope answered your questions there?Yes.And then in terms of the incremental market, these large metropolitan centers that you guys are targeting, should we think of those as relatively spread out across the country?Are there certain corridors that are targeted?Well, we had -- clearly, given that we’re only a small -- roughly a third, or 35% of the U.S. geographically, we’re hitting the major academics centers in the Northeast and then we’re also guiding our expansion in terms of where there is a high incidence of ADHD and a high diagnosis of ADHD as well.So we’re kind of guiding to we’ll get the best return -- hopefully the best return in the near-term.And then Ariel, you referenced also a step up or some increase investment in the infant nutrition side of the business.Is this something that is going to leverage InFat?Will this be done in conjunction or through AAK?What new capabilities is this going to bring to the portfolio.The new innovative ingredients that we are developing they make it to Enzymotec which is not part of the JV, is related to our product and our technologies.However we believe that we bring more value to the customer and when we bring more value to the customer, we also have to support all the basket in all innovative product, we'll bring them under one basket and have the customers to tailor made solutions based on their requirement.Okay and then just lastly, can you talk about your expectations for the profitability of the krill business call it in the next couple of quarter?Obviously we've talked about increased capacity for a little while here.I know that there is the industry is been together and there is marketing campaign.Has that been an incremental boost at all?If I understood your question you are asking about the margin on the krill business.And you were right mentioning that there is other capacity and we mentioned that it is closing pressure or pricing pressure, goes from the over capacity of all krill oil manufactures.Saying that, we think that we are well positioned or we believe that we are better positioned than our competitors considering our cost structure.And this may give us the latitude to compete on price.So that’s about the margins -- expected margins of both krill.Okay and are you seeing your competitors act rationally in the marketplace here or is there a significant -- I don’t want to say race to the bottom, but are you seeing intensified pricing pressure as we move through Q1?There is a price pressure, but we don’t see something that can harm the business if that's what you're pointing to.Okay.Thank you everyone for your participation and questions and for your support.We look forward to updating you on our progress on the third quarter 2015 earnings call in the coming months.Have a great day.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource
