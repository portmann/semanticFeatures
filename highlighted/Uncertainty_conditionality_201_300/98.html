(NYSE:RYN) | Seeking Alpha The stock is still expensive on forward earnings estimates and earnings growth potential, but I'm taking a contrarian view now.The dividend payout ratio is high on earnings and cash flow right now.The stock was hammered on what seemed like a decent earnings announcement, hence why I've turned contrarian on the name.The last time I wrote about Rayonier (NYSE: RYN ) I stated, "It has been about a month since I purchased any shares in the name, but I think the time may be coming to back up the truck on this name."I believe that time has now come.Since the article was published the stock has decreased 6.63% versus the 0.87% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) posted.Rayonier is an international forest products company.On February 12, 2015, the company reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.09 per share, which was in-line with the consensus of analysts' estimates.In the past year, the company's stock is down 42.11% and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 8.66% in the same timeframe.Since initiating my position back on February 25, 2014, I'm down 28.8% inclusive of reinvested dividends and dollar cost averaging but excluding the spin-off.With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock to see if right now is a good time to purchase more for the industrial and speculation portion of my portfolio.The company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 62.86, which is expensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past.On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 53.95 is currently expensively priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now.The 1-year PEG ratio (2.34), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 26.84%.The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 26.84%.On a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment.The company pays a dividend of 3.7% with a payout ratio of 233% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 3.5%, 6.3% and 4.8%, respectively, which are all respectable values.Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I believe the 3.7% yield of this company is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being.Looking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock near oversold territory with a current value of 36.4.I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next.I see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height which tells me bullish momentum should be mounting in the name.As for the stock price itself ($27.03), I'm looking at the 20-day simple moving average (currently $27.47) to act as resistance and $25.77 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio, which plays out to be -6.19% to 1.63%.The company reported fourth quarter earnings back on February 12th and earned $0.09 per share and the result was in-line with the consensus of analyst estimates.The revenue number came in at $147.4 million and beat estimates by $7.66 million.These were both pretty decent numbers but the stock dipped really hard on the back of those numbers, hence why I believe the buying opportunity has finally come.Fundamentally I believe the company to be expensively valued on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth potential but has great near-term earnings growth expectations.Financially, the company pays a great dividend with a high payout ratio based on earnings and cash flow.On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more risk than reward right now.I get the feeling that any and all bad news is now priced into the stock and that is why I'm taking a contrarian position and buying into the stock next week.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.This article is
