(NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha Rocked by bad press, lawsuits and even Congressional inquiries, Lumber Liquidators' sales somehow keep chugging along.Lumber Liquidators has significant flexibility in its business model to withstand temporary revenue shortfalls.Use of non-compliant HDF is not unique to Lumber Liquidators, and may even provide an opportunity to take market share.I am president of a regional retail flooring company, as well as an investor in a hardwood and laminate distribution company operating through a network of over 250 retail stores, builders and contractors in five states.Our retail business has historically shown a high degree of correlation between its financial performance and that of Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL ).I visit our vendors in China multiple times per year; go to flooring trade shows in Shanghai and Guangzhou; have in past years spoken with people in each of the factories mentioned in the 60 Minutes piece , and while I do not personally know the people shown in CBS' hidden video, my vendors have confirmed that they are who they purport to be (even though LL somehow cannot confirm they actually work for the factory!).Previously, I worked as a supervisor on a trading desk and as an internal analyst at a major institutional broker/dealer.In this piece when I mention "contacts" within the context of LL stores, I am referring to a network of installers who work directly with LL, and who assist the sales staff on the weekends.They have intimate knowledge of the front line of this business, as well as valuable insight into how LL has handled the crisis.These installers also work with us and are repeat customers of ours, purchasing material and supplies.Simply put, we know and trust them.We have also hired former LL employees, have in the past had direct communications with the company at all levels of the organization (usually quite adversarial) and receive feedback from our customers about their LL shopping experiences.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I can state unequivocally that a buyer of Chinese-made flooring products knows that the price negotiated, if below market, will result in an end product consisting of inferior materials.</span>In fact, some factories will offer laminate flooring that is substantially cheaper than other mills' pricing, even stating that they will use a "different grade" of high density fiberboard (HDF.)We in the business know what this means.In fact, there are only two ways to get a price concession: 1) use substandard materials, or 2) not pay the Unilin license fee.Since LL's "click" product boxes clearly show a holographic Unilin image representing a paid royalty to the patent holder, there is just one option: cheat on quality!On March 4, 2015, LL's management announced that they would not be attending the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference, but would instead host a 10 a.m. conference call on March 12 in order to give a business update.This was done for two reasons: 1) LL will attempt to provide its narrative in a controlled environment using some kind of "large chamber" or its own "documented" test results to refute the claims asserted in 60 Minutes and 2) LL wanted to get one weekend of sales performance under its belt to see how the negative press would impact its sales trends.(Saturdays/Sundays are the busiest days in the retail flooring trade, with traffic and sales representing approximately 40%-60% of weekly volume.)What is more shocking to me is not that LL allegedly purchased substandard laminate flooring, or even that it allegedly got caught.No, what I can't understand is that even after numerous negative comments, complaints about product quality (search Google for LL reviews and poor quality), testimonials from customers that involve both verbal and physical confrontations with LL employees and now all the negative press about potentially hazardous flooring, people still continue to buy and support the company.The fact that LL can survive all this leads me to believe that a bottom is approaching.LL's management informed us on February 25 that total revenues were up 21.4% through 2/23/2015.Since the 60 Minutes feature did not air until March 1, I think it is reasonable to conclude that this trend continued until the end of the month of February.Based on our own historical data, March represents just over 41% of Q1 sales.In the earnings release, LL CEO, Robert Lynch stated, "The Company expects percentage increases over 2014 to moderate over the remainder of the first quarter, a period that includes the beginning of the spring flooring season and historically represents approximately half of the first quarter's total net sales."If he means the period from February 23 until March 31, then our data suggest this is equivalent to approximately 47% of Q1 revenue, so I agree with him.Without statistically meaningful data or direct access to LL's accounting system to assist my calculations, I will use an educated guess based on our own historical figure of March being equal to 41% of Q1 sales; therefore, January and February will equal 59%.Notwithstanding customer fears about all Chinese-made flooring that has affected our business as well as the more direct disparagement of the LL brand, we continue to see strong demand for the spring remodeling season.I also have good knowledge from my contacts that even though some cancellations have occurred, LL's bookings for March, and even new bookings days right after 60 Minutes, are strong.Moreover, anecdotal evidence indicates that LL's sales during this past week have been consistent with previous years, and as of Saturday, 3/7/15, most of the furore over the 60 Minutes feature had subsided.As of 3/9/2015, there appear to be 354 LL locations, which is 23 more units than in the same quarter of 2014.We know from the 10K that LL's 2014 Q1 sales were $246.3 million.We also know from the 10K that LL's average quarterly revenues per store are approximately $770,000.If January and February are 59% of sales, and revenues were up 21.4%, and LL has opened up 23 new units in the past year, then even with a small decline in March same-store sales, I can reasonably estimate 2015 Q1 sales (in thousands) as follows: Clearly Mr. Lynch's margin comments in the conference call on February 25 are no longer relevant.I believe LL's gross margins will shrink but not as much as the market seems to be pricing in.Here's why: 1) In the 10K we find the following, "....the DOC issued a preliminary AD rate of 18.27% for purchases from December 2012 through November 2013 and a preliminary CVD rate of 0.97% for purchases in fiscal year 2012... we would owe approximately $5.7 million for shipments during the applicable time periods.If these rates remain in effect for shipments subsequent to November 2013 (AD) and shipments subsequent to December 2012 (Countervailing duties), we would owe an additional $6.3 million for all shipments through December 31, 2014... we believe there is at least a reasonable possibility that an additional loss may have been incurred in the range of $0 to $12.7 million."We have also been notified by our brokers that our AD rates will treble in 2015.Engineered hardwood represents approximately 11% of LL's sales, so a direct dollar for dollar impact on gross margins would be in the neighborhood of 1500 basis points; however, this is an industry-wide phenomenon, and as such, most of these costs will be borne by the consumer.Therefore, our internal estimate of gross margin erosion is 300-500 basis points by 2015 Q3.I reckon this number will be consistent with LL's results.2) I agree with Whitney Tilson from Kase Capital that, "at the very least LL now has to of course start sourcing its products legally," so that gross margins will see further deterioration in the second half of 2015.The cost difference to upgrade to a CARB2 HDF from a non-compliant HDF represents an increase of 8%-8.5% in LL's price.I have seen some analysts state that the Chinese-made laminate represents approximately 10% of LL's annual sales; I actually think it is even more.Since we already pay the higher price, our internal forecasts do not account for any margin erosion; however, as I know this is a fairly wide-spread issue, I see the consumer bearing some, but not all, of this extra cost, and as such, estimate this will lead to another reduction in gross margins by about 400 basis points.Consequently, my long-term estimate for LL gross margins should be between 700-900 bps below its mid-range projection.Moreover, my contacts have indicated that LL has not had to resort to discounting to book jobs after the 60 Minutes piece aired.Therefore, I estimate second half 2015 gross margins between 38.6% and 38.8%.Expenses, Write-downs, Competitive Landscape: During the conference call, Lynch forecasted 2015 Q1 SG&A within a 9%-12% range of increase over 2014 Q1.While the company cannot avoid certain costs associated with its supply chain upgrades, there is a lot of flexibility here.I think LL's reaction to this crisis will be three-fold: 1) it will immediately slow or halt the remodeling of its old-format stores, resuming later in the year, 2) it will start to slow down the rate of growth in new locations and 3) it will suspend any share buyback programs in place to shore up its cash reserves (this already happened in 2014 Q4 to provide additional liquidity for capital expenditures).LL also has tremendous leverage in its payroll, as store managers are primarily compensated by performance-based bonuses.Any short-term negative impact in sales will be partially offset on the bottom line by lower bonuses.Last week, I received an email from a Chinese supplier indicating that effective immediately, all boxes labeled as being CARB2-compliant will be inspected by a Chinese regulatory body.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If it fails to meet standards, it will need to be repackaged or shipped to another market.</span>As of 12/31/2014, LL had $48.4 million of its inventory listed as Inbound In-Transit.I do not know how much of this is still sitting in its Shanghai and Changzhou warehouses, but I think the write-downs for this inventory will be minimal to non-existent.LL's vendors can repackage this and ship to their east coast facility (doubtful as they will tacitly be admitting to using non-compliant HDF if their boxes now conveniently omit CARB2 labeling) or sell this material to suppliers in Australia, Europe or Asia for a minimal loss, if any.As far as the possible future liability stemming from the lawsuits, it is clearly hard to quantify.Yet, if we take Mr. Richard Drury's comments from 60 Minutes at face value, i.e., tens of thousands of people will want their floors replaced in California (let's call it 20,000 homes and that is highly unlikely, but let's use a worst-case scenario), and since I know from many years of experience that the average job in our industry is 500 square feet, one can reasonably calculate a $50-$55 million reserve.Yes, a substantial number, but if you consider LL's cash flow from operations generated $57 million last year, it's not going to bankrupt them.As to any Proposition 65 related fines, and I am certainly not an expert in this area, my research indicates that this will not be much more than a slap on the wrist; same with the DOJ's Lacey Act complaint.With respect to the rest of the industry, several smaller and larger players have also purchased laminate flooring with lower-quality HDF.Some of my vendors have done business with firms such as Floor&Decor (F&D, not publicly traded but filed in November 2014 for an IPO) and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW ).Essentially all the laminate flooring in China is made in one province, and everyone knows everyone else.I have knowledge that F&D purchases some of its laminate flooring from one of the factories mentioned in the 60 Minutes feature.I also know that within the last 12 months, LOW has purchased laminate flooring from a factory known to offer "lower-quality HDF."None of this means that any of their products are non-compliant; however, I know the issue is not isolated to LL, and hence, will protect LL's competitive pricing, and therefore support my margin thesis, vis-a-vis its competitors.I fully expect LL to have a positive conference call on Thursday, and I also expect it to change the full-year guidance to as follows: Revenue in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.15 billion with a small drop in the rate of same-store sales growth.It will open fewer stores and most likely provide some clarity on its remodeling efforts.I think the net effect of this will be to reduce SG&A expenses going forward, with better-than-expected gross margins (from what the market is pricing into the stock), and a new full-year EPS range between $2.25/share and $2.50/share - something that I think it can hit on the high end.While the bad publicity and outrage surrounding the CBS airing of LL's poor internal control, complete incompetence and/or its willful complicity in selling tainted laminate flooring will undoubtedly tarnish the company's brand, I have been quite surprised by the company's resilience and the amount of apathy apparent in customers visiting our stores.So unless there is another catalyst (and that is a frightfully BIG "unless"), and assuming the lawsuits and fines levied by the state of California are not too onerous, I believe that not only will the company survive, but ultimately take market share from the weaker players in the industry who have also cheated, but do not have the pulpit from which to control their message.Right now everyone is presumed to be guilty, and only LL is prepared for the assault upon the industry's credibility.By Q4 of this year, and again assuming none of the contingent liabilities break the bank, the company will be back on track to consistent and sustained growth.Source: A Hardwood Flooring Insider's Take On Lumber Liquidators Disclosure: The author is long LL.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Our firm is a direct competitor to LL.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
