(NYSEARCA:DXJ) | Seeking Alpha This ETF is hedged with no yen exposure and yields 1.60% with major institutional investors.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>How will this ETF do going forward if the Nikkei continues to climb in 2015?</span>The WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (NYSEARCA: DXJ ) is an established, (inception date: June 16, 2006), primarily large-cap fund, with over $14.2 billion in assets.According to the fund's sponsor: The Fund seeks investment results that closely correspond to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Wisdom Tree Japan Hedged Equity Index.The Index and the Fund are designed to provide exposure to equity securities in Japan while at the same time hedging exposure to fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.The Index and the Fund seek to track the performance of equity securities in Japan that is attributable solely to stock prices without the effect of currency fluctuations.The index with a symbol of (WTIDJH) has an inception date of February 01, 2010.Prior to March 31, 2010, the ETF was based upon the WisdomTree Japan Dividend and Japan Hedged Spliced Index.The index presently has 384 constituents while the ETF has 324 holdings, plus 21 currency contracts.We will break down the capitalization, style, sector, industry and components along with a brief analysis of the Japanese economy and provide our recommendation.In terms of market capitalization, as we mentioned, the majority of the firms in this ETF are large cap.In terms of a breakdown, it is quite simple: These cap weightings are courtesy of xtf.com.Morningstar breaks them down slightly differently with giant at 58.95%, large: 28.36%, medium: 9.92%, small: 2.74%, and micro: 0.03%.Fidelity is similar with large: 62.58%, mid: 24.07%, small: 9.19% and other at 4.19%.Our overall consensus of these data providers is that the market capitalization of this ETF is primarily large-size companies.Though the fund itself is considered non-diversified, the Index Selection includes the largest dividend-paying companies from WisdomTree's Japan Dividend Index that are traded in yen, with a minimum market capitalization of $100 million and with no more than 80% of their revenue generated from inside Japan.The index itself is broken down as follows: Large cap (greater than $10 billion): 75.02%, mid cap (equal and greater than $2 billion and less than or equal to $10 billion): 17.69%, and small cap (less than $2 billion): 7.29%.As we will examine shortly, due to its sheer size and market share, many of the names in the ETF and index are quite recognizable.We like this mix quite a lot.We feel that the value and growth aspect here bode well for a continued improvement in the Japanese economy and continued growth of the Nikkei going forward in 2015.We have no issues with this style weighting of the ETF.Though WisdomTree does state that 100% of the country allocations are in Japan, Fidelity breaks it down with Japan at 95.70%, United States: 4.19% and Korea at .11%.This is due to the headquarters location of the companies.In any event, due to the hedging, 100% of the holdings are in US dollars.This does contribute to a tracking error, which we will review later in the analysis.In terms of sector exposure, there are no surprises here.We expected large brand consumer focused companies, along with well-known industrials and IT/financial firms as leading sectors.For further details, it is necessary to review the industry exposure of the ETF.Similar to our recent analysis of the rather large iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM ), we broke down the exhaustive list of the industries.There is quite a mix of industries here, with well-known automobile names leading the way at 14.78%, and pharmaceuticals, and trading companies and distributors in second and third places, respectively.Once again, this ETF is not considered properly diversified due to a focus on "too narrow" an industry scope within its core components.It also is extremely "top heavy" with the top components representing a very large percentage.For a further understanding, here are the top 15 components, their symbols, ratings (Moody's/S&P), weights within the ETF, and the underlying index, (WTIDJH).We have no surprises here with the top 15 components except for a few withdrawn ratings, or WR.The rating quality from both Moody's and S&P are in the higher classification of investment grade, and while there is a slight weighting difference from the index, it is negligible and does not contribute a great deal to the tracking error of the ETF.The household global names for the majority of the holdings attest to not only their market size and marketing power, but also sheer global presence.The top 15 components of the fund total 43.427% while the remaining 309 totals 56.57298%.As a comparison, the index's top 15 represents 43.17481% and the remaining 369 totals 56.82519%.There is obviously little sampling error in the passive management approach, also termed indexing in this ETF.Though some critics have pointed out that WisdomTree manages the index and this is a cause for a conflict, we do not see it.For one issue, we find the transparency of index information refreshing.On many other of our other analyses, we have had quite difficulty in obtaining data and up-to-date information from the index provider even after repeated phone calls and e-mails.We commend WisdomTree for being transparent in its dissemination of data.As one can note, there is a large weighting in autos and overall weighting of these top 15 components.As such, as we mentioned earlier, it is a very nice selection of quality names, but it would not be considered truly diversified.There is one amusing item of note.In spite of our years of experience, we had forgotten that tobacco is considered a Consumer Staple while autos or tires are considered Consumer Discretionary.There truly is a difference economically (and within industry classification) between needs and wants when it comes to tobacco products and basic or luxury transportation.Unlike other ETFs we have analyzed, the underlying index is only rebalanced on an annualized basis as opposed to semi-annually or quarterly.With such a large-cap contingent, this is not an issue, as it would be highly unlikely, i.e. "black swan event," for one or more of the top holdings to suddenly become high yield, aka "fallen angel," or default.The expense ratio of the ETF at .48% is reasonable with an asset class median of .58%.The turnover ratio of 24% is competitive with an asset class median of 17.72%.In terms of the all important returns, with the recent five-year high of the Nikkei 225 and up 8.70% so far this year, we expected the fund to be outperforming most other ETFs at this time.In addition, as the yen has remained fairly stable (down only 1.00% against the dollar this year), export-focused businesses have done fine and would benefit further with a larger decline.Companies that would benefit, of course, would be well-known automobile manufactures, pharmaceutical firms, information technology, and capital goods manufacturers.Nomura recently stated that the value of Japanese equities is at a discount to US equities (TOPIX versus S&P 500).As such, it stated that Japanese equities are rallying in tandem with the US market, and underlying companies continue to grow.We concur with its analysis.In terms of valuations, Japan presently trades at 13.6 times 2015 earnings, below the 17.3 times for the US and 16.4 times for Europe.Goldman feels that there is an additional 15% upside to the TOPIX in 2015, and we agree with its statement that corporate earnings will grow 22% this year, thanks in part to a lower tax rate.What is surprising is the lack of general foreign money in the Japanese markets.It should be noted that the majority of non-domestic investors removed funds from Japan due to the weakening yen.They did not have the advantage of participating with an ETF that has an adequate hedge.We will return to this aspect shortly.It should be noted that the return features a semi-annual dividend and end-of-year short-term and long-term capital gain.In December 2014, it totaled $5.17212 per share, or 9.51%.This is not an issue in tax deferred accounts or for the large institutional shareholders, but may be an issue for those who reinvest the distributions, (phantom income), or elect to receive the distributions.Overall, the ETF performed extremely well over the past year and has continued to do so into 2015.The Beta of the ETF and its holdings is relatively consistent with large-tier firms tracking the overall market, and we did not expect any large divergence from 1.0.It is interesting that the beta on the index is almost half (.58) of the MSCI EAFE.The EAFE acronym of course stands for Europe, Australasia and Far East.Our basic analysis is that simply removing Europe, and Australia to a lesser extent, brings the overall index risk factor down significantly.In terms of the underlying price/trailing earnings at 13.66, the asset class median comes in at 16.79, which is a true positive.The price-to-book is lower as well at 1.20 versus 1.88.We have no issues here with these ratios and feel there is significant upside to the underlying companies within the index.The ETF has not only done well so far this year, but also reported net flows of 763.94 million in February.This is attributed to further flows of institutional assets seeking opportunities.Interestingly, there is also a 21.98% increase in Short Interest.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Our feeling is it will be quite a while, if at all, before the majority of retail invests directly in the fund.</span>This is attributed to inadequate information and simple unknown risk of entering (or reentering) a foreign market while the US market does well.The overall returns has been somewhat skewed by a tracking error of 1.38 versus an asset class median of only .57.This is not necessarily due to not matching the indexes' performance.Our analysis indicates the currency forwards which permit the hedging tend to skew the returns down slightly from the underlying index.These hedges have performed quite well in a stable and lower yen environment.They will continue to do so going forward in 2015.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If and when the yen strengths, they will tend to also skew the results as well.</span>This ETF allows investors to participate in a foreign market with a large "immunization" against currency movements and their underlying pain.We are strongly bullish on this ETF and feel it is undiscovered by many in spite of its institutional asset size.We recommend a buy for the balance of 2015 and look for an additional 12-15+% return, plus dividends.Source: Japan Hedged Equity Fund Is +25.30% For 2014
