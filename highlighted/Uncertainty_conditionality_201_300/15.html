Key Strengths of USD It is this divergence in growth momentum that is powering the strength of the USD.China has revised its growth target to 7% in 2015 after missing its 7.5% growth target in 2014 by 0.1%.Other major economies like Australia and Canada are threatened by the low energy prices, as they are energy producers and they too expect lower growth this year.Europe is still struck in an uncertain future of economic growth and while there might be signs of sporadic recovery, we cannot be sure that this recovery will be sustained at such an early stage and the same can be said for Japan.Beyond the different pace of economic growth, we are continuing to see divergence in monetary policy.For instance, the European Central Bank (ECB) has started to implement its $60 billion euro/ month of monetary easing policy this month and its total easing package is expected to be $1.14 trillion euros.The Bank of Japan (BOJ) continues on its $80 trillion yen of monetary easing and it is buying 90% of the Japanese Government Bonds being issued.This is in addition to the easing by the central banks of China, India, Australia and Canada in the past 3 months.Most importantly, the favorable data this month has lead to market expectations to consolidate to mid 2015 liftoff consensus or even earlier.This is after some expectations of September 2015 liftoff by some notable investors.The market will be on the lookout for the 17-18 March 2015 FOMC meeting and the statement at the end of the meeting on 18 March 2015.We can have a measure of the USD strength through the PowerShares DB USD Bull ETF (NYSEARCA: UUP ).The UUP tracks the performance of the USD against Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc through the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index.The UUP chart below shows that the USD has resumed its uptrend after it stalled in February 2015.It is a universally known fact that nothing goes up forever.The USD has been on a bull run for 7 months from July 2014 to January 2015.After 7 months of strong run, it is remarkable that the break in its uptrend resulted in the range of the USD and not in decline which I had expected.The strong labor market report spiked the gap up 2 candles ago, as seen in the daily chart above.Considering the notable hits and misses of the USD this month, I would expect to see a gradual strengthening of the USD for at least this month and another 2 months ahead.Source: Favorable USD Data Prelude March 2015 FOMC Meeting Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.</span>We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
