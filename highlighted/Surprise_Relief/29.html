(NYSE:C) | Seeking Alpha The successful passing of the CCAR should serve as a catalyst for the shares of Citigroup.The Fed granted authorization to increase the dividend to 5 cents per share along with a share repurchase authorization worth over $7 billion dollars.The news is a positive yet when taken with the news of the recent Costco credit card win coupled with the disposal of One Main Financial a compelling picture emerges.The shares are meaningfully undervalued as will be detailed below.The successful passing of the second part of the CCAR served as vindication for the executive team at Citigroup (NYSE: C ).Coming off the heels of last year's less than stellar performance, careers were on the line as the board would not tolerate a subsequent fail.The article below will serve as an update on my bullish stance in C. Tangible book value (NYSEMKT: TBV ) is the value of a company once the intangible assets are removed from the balance sheet.In essence it is the liquidation value of the firm, an especially relevant metric for financial firms since their primary product is money.C TBV as of the fourth quarter of 2014 stood at $56.83 per share.C is trading for a 7.5% discount to liquidation value making it one of the best bargains available.The shares have consistently traded for under their TBV for all of 2014, as a catalyst is needed to jump start the firm.The most obvious way for management to capitalize on the low valuation afforded to the firm would be to repurchase shares on the open market.Alas if life were so simple, C needs to obtain annual permission via the CCAR process to return excess capital to shareholders.Fortunately for current shareholders, management performed admirably with the Fed granting permission for a 5 cent per share quarterly dividend along with $7.8 billion dollars worth of share repurchases.Based on the recent closing price of $52.33, the repurchase plan would reduce approximately 5% of the float.In my view, it would be prudent for management to purchase as many shares as possible while the discount to TBV exists.The repurchase made under TBV would nicely set C up for share price gains while increasing book value, one of the prime metrics used in evaluating banks.I expect the discount to TBV to disappear in rapid fashion now that the Fed has allowed the firm to return some excess capital.C recently announced a deal to jettison its subprime lending arm dubbed One Main Financial for $4.25 billion.I applaud the move as C is attempting to reduce its risk profile by exiting the subprime market while offsetting the loss with the acquisition of the higher net worth Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) consumer credit business formerly held by American Express (NYSE: AXP ).When combined with the previous announcement of the intent to exit 11 consumer markets, a clearer picture merges concerning management's future vision for the company.C is shrinking its global footprint while exiting the subprime consumer market that tends to suffer a higher rate of defaults once hard times set in.Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) long considered by many as the best run financial institution, recently imposed a 10% cap on subprime auto loans.It would seem the more conservative management teams are afraid the subprime market may get a bit frothy hence they are looking to reduce exposure here.The key for the banks is to maintain lending discipline to avoid a 2009 meltdown.I am heartened to see C follow in WFC footsteps and limit subprime exposure.The COST business will grant C a credit relationship with a diverse customer base with an average income north of $80,000 per year.It would behoove management to expand the relationship further by shifting the newly acquired customers into additional financial products.I would love to see C partner with COST for member specials on savings, checking and mortgage deals.Speculation on when the Fed will raise interest rates is all the rage currently on Wall Street.Coming off the heels of the strong unemployment report, many now expect the Fed funds rate to rise a quarter point in June.I am firmly in the camp we will see the rates rise this year, the exact timing is maybe a bit tenuous.An increase would be of great benefit to the banks as their Net Interest Margin (NIM) would increase thus ensuring greater profits.Net interest margin is a measure of the difference between the interest income generated by banks or other financial institutions and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders (for example, deposits), relative to the amount of their (interest-earning) assets.My take away here is the NIM will revert from a major headwind to a slight tailwind that will aid the earnings power of the banks.The banks will generate further excess capital thus ensuring another successful CCAR process next year.This should delight shareholders as I expect an additional bump to the dividend along with further share repurchases.With the successful passing of the CCAR which will allow the firm to return a substantial amount of excess capital, what would be a reasonable expectation concerning the share price of C?C current book value is 66.16 per share as of the fourth quarter of 2014.I believe it is quite sensible to expect C to trade on par with its BV, hence my year end target price is $66 per share.To add further context to my numbers, WFC trades at 1.6 times BV while JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) is valued right at BV.In light of the stellar performance by management combined with the disposal of One Main and the Costco win, a reasonable case can be made that C belongs in the same sentence as JPM.Using the shares recent closing price of $52, my target implies an upside of over 25%.The main risk to the thesis revolves around a global economic meltdown similar to what was witnessed in 2009.I am quite confident the regulators have thoroughly scrubbed the books of all the financial institutions however the risk while quite small needs to be mentioned.The second major risk is execution risk, namely the One Main deal falls through and buyers of the consumer business that C is looking to divest fail to materialize.So far, that does not seem to be the case, however the future is undetermined.In my opinion it is reasonable to expect a buyer of the various businesses to emerge as long as global economic conditions remain favorable.The third risk is the company fails to capitalize on their low share price and waits before beginning the share repurchase plan.In my view, management should consider their shares as the equivalent of purchasing a dollar for 93 cents.I do not believe the discount will remain for long, it would be prudent to capitalize on it while available.As a shareholder of C, I was quite heartened by today's capital return announcement.I believe the management team has delivered on the promises made last year after the less than stellar performance.C has meaningfully turned the corner, I am pleased to see the disposal of the subprime business along with the addition of the COST branded credit card agreement.C remains one of my top five holdings, let's see if the management team can further capitalize on the opportunity presented before them.I thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.Source: Examining My Bullish Thesis On Citigroup In Light On Yesterday's Announcement Disclosure: The author is long C,
