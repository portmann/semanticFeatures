(NYSE:CNS) | Seeking Alpha Cohen & Steers has a perfect balance sheet with no liabilities because it relies on human capital and therefore has high returns to fund future growth.</span>Despite a $1.9 billion market capitalization, Cohen & Steers only has 247 employees and a return on capital rate of over 30.5%.This company that specializes in making real estate investments pays a dividend roughly double what people think because it has a pattern of special, one-time dividends.I have a special fondness for companies that have little assets and high profits.Although I make the occasional expensive purchase, I tend to shun companies that are especially asset-intensive.I adopted this point of view after reading Charlie Munger's anecdotes about earnings quality when he poked fun at certain farm businesses that must take the profits from their enterprises and reinvest them into new equipment to maintain their competitive positions.Companies that are not asset intensive tend to have an easier time reinvesting for growth (rather than maintenance of the status quo) and tend to have an easier time passing on profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.A classic example of this phenomenon in Cohen & Steers (NYSE: CNS ).You won't see it show up in many stock screeners because the dividend doesn't appear to be especially impressive.A stock screen will tell you that Cohen & Steers pays out a $0.25 quarterly dividend, and only yields around 2.4%.It will show you a 1.0% annual dividend growth rate over the past five years.This kind of quick-and-dirty glance at a company tends to overlook companies with unusual business practices.In particular, Cohen & Steers regularly pays out special dividends that make this company more of a dividend stock than a mere cursory glance might suggest.The specific payments have been as follows: Cohen & Steers paid shareholders a one-time dividend of $1.50 in 2012 in addition to the regular payments, paid a special dividend of $1.00 per share in 2013 in addition to the regular payments, and paid a special dividend of $1.00 to shareholders last year in addition to the regular dividend.The effective dividend yield has been closer to the 5% mark when you take into account the special dividends, roughly double the advertised rate offered by potential investors that glance at the quarterly rate alone.Why is it that Cohen & Steers is able to make a habit of giving shareholders large one-time dividends in addition to the regular payments?It has to do with the lack of capital necessary to make the company operate.Even though Cohen & Steers is a $1.9 billion company, it only has 247 employees.It manages closed-end mutual funds, open mutual funds, and institutional funds with a focus on the real estate markets (both American and abroad) and also does some utility work.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A business like this relies on human capital, and profits can easily pass through to the shareholders because the physical requirements to run the business are minimal.</span>It has no debt.It has no uncapitalized leases.It has no capitalized leases with hell-or-highwater clauses.It has no preferred stock.It has no pension liability.It has no accounts payable.It has no inventory.It's people managing money.The balance sheet is perfectly clean, and Cohen & Steers is sitting on $209 million in cash assets, roughly 11% of its market cap.Cash flow has been increasing by 9.5% annually, even though the company regularly ships off excess cash to shareholders (and still finds itself building a large cash position in spite of these regular one-time dividends).Of course, businesses that run on human capital do not come without risks.If some of the funds get mismanaged, not only do you have to deal with the lower returns but you also have to deal with people entrusting you to manage their real estate simultaneously.A worst case scenario panned out in 2009 when profits of $25 million briefly turned into losses of $4 million as the company had to dip into its cash reserves to stay afloat through the financial crisis.The dividend was $0.20 per share during the financial crisis (and this was funded with borrowings), and there were no special dividends either.That is what the downside of the real-estate fund management business can look like.Of course, over the full course of the business cycle, a company like Cohen & Steers still does exceptionally well as the investors that bought right before the financial crisis have still reaped 11% annual returns since that date.If you bought Cohen & Steers during the financial crisis, your annual returns have been 30% annualized since March 2009.Cohen & Steers is more compelling than superficial glances at the real estate company might indicate.Due to special dividends, the yield is roughly double the advertised rate of stock screeners.The balance sheet carries no liabilities, and Cohen & Steers has a growing cash hoard that will likely lend itself to another special one-time dividend this year.Given that it earns 30.5% returns on total capital, the effectiveness of this company at creating profits is something to admire even if you don't get around to buying the stock.For those that do get around to buying the stock, the result is a long-term record of market-beating returns due to the low amount of physical capital expenditures necessary to run the business.Source: Buy The Dividend Company That Manages All The Real Estate Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate
