Zynga won't be able to attract the old school, traditional player base that it is seeking.Not to be stereotypical, but surveys find that female gamers are more likely to be attracted to and play fast-paced, casual games.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Males tend toward hardcore games with longer session times that are more in-line with what they have been familiar with through consoles and PCs.</span>This can be traced back to the demographic roots of gaming; males are simply attracted to games to which they are accustomed (ones that have longer play times with skill-based competition).Mobile games like Candy Crush Saga and Farmville broke the traditional stereotypical barriers of what constituted the average gamer.Both games were able to attract a more diversified realm of players beyond the core gamer male aged 12-25.Candy Crush Saga's players are, in fact, more likely to be female, and almost 40% of players are above age 35 .Bright colors, intuitive design, and an easy learning curve made the games more appealing to a wide population.This diversification helped lead to the monetization of a previously untapped portion of the population for video games and is what made the casual mobile game movement so revolutionary.Now it should be no surprise to anyone viewing available information that Dawn of Titans, as a war-based strategy game, is targeting a male audience.On its surface, you might even think it wise to target males, as they are more likely to spend money on "freemium" games.But the game is setting itself up as a quick-paced game with short sessions, much like other successful mobile games: You need to be able to start and finish a session while you're waiting for your macchiato to arrive.It's a huge challenge with these big battles, but I'm really happy we've managed to solve it.- Torsten Reil , CEO of NaturalMotion This creates a problem.Traditional male gamers are used to ten minute team matches in Call of Duty and the strategy involved (real time movement, analog stick based aiming, team strategy).They are not going to be interested in a 30-second battle where the strategy revealed thus far can be summed up in a few swipes on a touchscreen to direct teams of units one way or the other.Mobile is simply not built to compete with consoles and PCs for the core male player base.It isn't a surprise that Zynga CEO, Don Mattrick, would push the company this way.As prior head of EA (NASDAQ: EA ) and subsequently the Xbox division at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), he is just doing what has always worked for him: pushing games with high-end graphics toward a male player base.That is all he knows.You'd think the above demographic analysis would be common sense for a CEO, but Mattrick has shown to have no connection with the gaming community.In May of 2013, he stated (in reference to the Xbox One) that Microsoft has "a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity; it's called Xbox 360."This enraged gamers worldwide.This issue is viewed as almost single-handedly responsible for the Xbox One's poor launch compared to Sony's PlayStation 4 by gamers, a gap that led to a 40% outsale by the PlayStation 4 over the first year amid harsh backlash and negative consumer sentiment.Xbox One had heavy momentum going into this product launch, and it was completely blown.His departure to Zynga in July was well-timed.If I were Steve Ballmer and had entrusted him with this product launch, I would have fired him.Zynga is on life support.The company's continued share dilution and burning of its cash aren't going to stop anytime soon.Zynga needs a big win, and I believe that Dawn of Titans isn't going to be it.This is a departure from my usual stock analysis; there are no discounted cash flow models and no analyzing 10-K disclosures to be found here.There is plenty of that on Seeking Alpha to paint the negative picture of the financials.This is just an article from someone who enjoys games who sees the writing on the wall.Source: Zynga: Dawn Of Titans Makes The Company A Sell Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in ZNGA over the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
