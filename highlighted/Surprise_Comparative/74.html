McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) is trading at 3.4x sales, Yum Brands (NYSE: YUM ) at 2.6x sales, Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ) at 5x sales, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) at 4.1x sales.So basically if sales grow at these projected levels, and we assume that SHAK is among the high-flying competitors that also trade at around 4x, then SHAK will be fairly valued in 2019 and have the same valuation... so investors today make a 0% return....While in London for a conference, I asked about a dozen friends if they heard of SHAK.My crowd ranged from 20s to 50s.Only the oldest person actually heard of SHAK.So it doesn't look well-known.I asked my friend Perry to join me for lunch at Covent Garden - the shack's location.As you see from the photos, its not a big store.Fortunately we didn't have to sit in the square.The store is divided into 2 sections: the one where you order (shown in photos) and the one where you can sit (not shown).There are probably around 12 tables so its not huge but as people take a quick bite and leave, we found a seat.The service was excellent.After finding a table, a waiter took our buzzer (received after ordering) and brought us our food.The quality was again excellent.I enjoyed my burger and cheese fries.It wasn't cheap, as you can see from the menu and bill, but worth it.My friend Perry also enjoyed the burger but told me there were quite a few similar places.A few nights later I went to a bar/restaurant with friends and had an Angus beef cheeseburger which was around GBP 17 (before fries).This place was again at Covent Garden.So it looks like there is a) competition and b) its priced between McDonald's and other casual dining places.That means that some work will need to be done on the marketing side.That was confirmed by my friends who thought that the name was stupid.They thought it sold shakes but would never think it sold burgers... It's a great burger and there could be a place for SHAK if they can keep the quality consistent and build the brand, but the stock is overpriced.Current shareholders should exit the position, while there is money to be made on the short side once some momentum builds in that direction.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Personally, I will be monitoring for a opportunity to short if price breaks lower on strong volume.</span>Source: Projections Point To An Overvalued Stock Despite The Tasty London Burger Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in SHAK over the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
