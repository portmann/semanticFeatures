the arrangement by which the supply chain of a company is also owned by the company - to create a successful and profitable business model.One which shows no signs of faltering.At the expected price, Summit Material will be a good, if unexceptional, stock.Although necessary, it doesn't have either the flash of tech stocks or the high risk/high reward of financial stocks.The company, if it continues its current practices, will continue to show profit and expand the business for the foreseeable future.Source: Denver-Based Summit Materials Rolls Out IPO Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it.The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
