53,000 customers for $74.0 million May 2014: Purchase of water distribution in Arkansas; 2,500 customers for $4.5 million Sept 2014: Purchase of water and wastewater distribution, Park Water, from a private equity firm; 73,600 customers for $327 million.Nov 2014: Minority investor with Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) to build the Northeast Energy Direct natural gas pipeline.Initial interest is 2.5% with the opportunity to increase to 10% upon completion in 2016.Total capital investment could be upwards of $400 million.In addition, the Algonquin Power segment expanded its generating capacity in the US.In Sept 2014, the company announced its purchase of Odell Wind Farm under construction in Minnesota with a production capacity of 200 MW sold to XCEL Energy using a 20-yr purchase power agreement that includes a 2.5% annual escalation.Total investment is expected to be $313.5 million.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Last Aug, management changed its dividend policy to better reflect exposure to the US utility sector.</span>From their quarterly filings : The Board approved a dividend increase to U.S. $0.35, paid quarterly at a rate of U.S. $0.0875.Based on the U.S. dollar exchange rate as at August 14, 2014 of $1.091, the change in dividend to U.S. $0.35 represents an equivalent dividend of CDN $0.382 and an increase of 12.4% as compared to the previous dividend of CDN $0.34.The change in the currency of the dividend better aligns APUC's dividend with the currency profile of its underlying operations.APUC's combined assets of Algonquin Power Co. and Liberty Utilities Co. are approximately 80% based in the U.S., which generate approximately 80% of its underlying cash flows.Management believes that the dividend increase is consistent with APUC's stated strategy of delivering total shareholder return comprised.To finance its expansion, AQUNF has been issuing additional shares in addition to private placements of preferred stock and subordinated debentures.For example, over the past year, management has issued 30 million shares, with a value of $370 million, representing a dilution of about 11.8% to shareholders.Of this issuance, Nova Scotia-based utility Emera Inc. ( OTCPK:EMRAF ), (EMA.TO) purchased 11 million shares worth $100 million.As of last Nov, Emera owns 50 million shares for a 22% ownership of the 227 million shares outstanding.Emera has a current standstill agreement at 25% of outstanding shares.The company has an interesting history.It started as a Canadian Unit Trust, much like US-based MLPs, and converted in 2009 to a Corporation structure when Canadian tax law changed in 2009.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Since the conversion, AQUNF has paid out a higher dividend than its reported earnings and this is outlined in the chart below from 4-traders.</span>com .EBITDA has been growing at a quick pace.In 2012, EBITDA was CAD$106 million and, according to 4-traders, is expected to be CAD$435 million in 2016.This would generate a 5-yr average EBITDA growth of 62% and a 3-yr EBITDA growth rate of 19%.Based on a continuation of a 20% EPS growth rate, fastgraph.com offers the following table for 10-yr earnings yield estimates: Algonquin stock trades on the Toronto Exchange using the symbol AQN.TO, and it is their home exchange.US NASDAQ takes the Toronto Exchange price, converts to US dollar based on the current exchange rate and quotes share prices for US investors.For example, the current price for AQN.TO is CAD$10.31 while AQUNF is quoted at $8.25.As the exchange rates move, so does the share price conversion from Canadian into US dollars.As the US dollar strengthens against the Canadian loonie, the US share price declines, all things being equal.As the loonie strengthens, the US share price increases, all things being equal.For example, below is the 1-yr price only comparison chart for Algonquin shares traded on the Toronto and US exchanges.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As shown, the US price (red line) is up 20.5% over the previous 12 months vs. a much better increase of 35.3% for the Toronto traded shares (blue line).</span>This is based mainly on exchange rate fluctuations.Below is chart from Bloomberg.com of the exchange rate USD:CAD over the previous 12 months.As shown, the low was $1.06 in July to a current $1.25, for a 17.9% spread.It is no coincidence that the performance between the two stock prices diverged in Dec as the exchange rate rose quickly from $1.13 to $1.25.While the dividend is being paid in US dollars, stock prices are still at the mercy of exchange rate fluctuations.At the current price of USD $8.25, the $0.35 dividend represents a 4.2% yield.The strength of the US dollar has been the story of international investing since last May.The negative impact of strength of the dollar made into the most recent Beige Book, the Fed's publication of comments on the economy by region.From an article in Fortune Magazine, even the Federal Reserve is studying the impact of a rising US dollar on the US economy: That is why the Federal Reserve is split over how to handle the strong dollar.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the most recent Fed minutes, some central bank governors argued that an expensive dollar should be reason to keep interest rates lower for a longer period of time.</span>Others pointed to the fact that a strong dollar can be stimulative and argued that it's a reason to think about raising rates sooner.The effects of a strong dollar are so complex that even the nation's most powerful economists cannot agree on what it means.Utility investors who believe the majority of exchange rate movements are behind us should review Algonquin.While the dividend will be unaffected by a reduction in the US dollar against the Canadian loonie, the value of the underlying shares will be positively affected.In addition, it would not be surprising if Emera eventually acquires Algonquin.I, for one, think the stellar rise in the USD is just about over and while dollar weakness is not necessarily in the near future, neither will be a run-away exchange rate from today's elevated levels.Corporate earnings for the 4th quarter and year 2014 have been delayed and are now due out on March 26.When issued, they should demonstrate continued EPS growth.Author's Note: Please review disclosure in Author's profile.<span
