(NYSE:SMFG) | Seeking Alpha SMFG's average target price and discounted dividend value is more than $10 per share, which represents 30%-35% upside.</span>Prime Minister Abe is proposing to cut corporate taxes by 8%, which would likely boost SMFG's share price by at least 12%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A share buyback of between 50 and 100 billion yen is likely to happen by May, which could boost EPS 2% or more.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The weaker yen will boost foreign investment from countries like the United States and China because foreign investors can buy more Japanese assets with the stronger currencies.</span>The Bank of Japan is set to buy $672.53 billion of government bonds per year; much like the U.S. Fedâ€™s QE began doing in late 2008.Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: SMFG ) is Japan's second largest bank with total assets near $1.5 trillion.SMFG's share price is undervalued and the street is recognizing it.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>SMFG is overwhelmingly rated a buy and its average target price, according to FactSet, is more than $10 per share (~30% upside) with Credit Suisse setting a price target of close to $13 (~65% upside).</span>SMFG has three important macro tailwinds working in its favor - namely the Bank of Japan's quantitative easing policy, corporate tax cuts proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (which could boost earnings by 12%), and the weak yen.Moreover, SMFG is considering buybacks which could boost SMFG's share price an additional 2%.SMFG's low share price (and Japan's depressed market levels in general) is the culmination of the "Lost 20 years" in the Japanese economy coupled with the slow recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis.The "Lost 20 years" refers to the period from 1991 - 2010 when Japan's economy suffered from prolonged deflation because of the bursting of the asset bubble in the Japanese markets in the late 80's and early 90's.From 1995 - 2007, Japan's GDP contracted roughly 18% from $5.33 trillion in 1995 to $4.36 trillion in 2007.Investors are still somewhat pessimistic about economic conditions in the world's third largest economy and have been slow to realize the effects of the central bank's quantitative easing and "Abenomics"- economic policies designed by the Japanese Prime Minister to reignite the Japanese economy.Thus far, the measures appear to be working and the market seems to be responding to the economic reforms.The Nikkei 225, Japan's largest stock exchange, has nearly doubled over the last three years.Japan's economy appears poised for a recovery and according to Barron's Japan might be the best place to make money in 2015 .<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>SMFG will be a direct beneficiary of the recovery because consumers, corporations, and governments will spend and invest more, interest rates will slowly begin to rise, and SMFG will see an expansion in margins as a result.</span>SMFG's earnings and stock price will be directly affected by the Bank of Japan's monetary policies because interest rates will dictate how much individuals, corporations, and governments will borrow and invest in the economy.Interest rates are of paramount concern to SMFG because thin interest margins can pressure the bank's earnings.The recovering Japanese economy will gradually lift interest rates and SMFG's margins will increase with it.The Bank of Japan is set to buy $672.53 billion of government bonds for the foreseeable future; much like the U.S. Fed's QE began doing in late 2008.The U.S. stock market responded positively and so should the Japanese markets.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Buying up government bonds works to lower interest rates in the short-term to spur economic growth in the long-run.</span>Cutting corporate taxes will boost corporate profits because of an increased incentive for Japanese corporations to invest and a reduction in income tax expense.For instance, SMFG's trailing twelve months pre-tax earnings were roughly $9.24 billion.Abe's decision to cut the corporate tax rate by 8% would likely boost SMFG's earnings by roughly $739MM, or 11 cents per share.An 11 cent per share increase in earnings would boost SMFG's total earnings and stock price by 12%, assuming valuation multiples remained constant.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>($0.11 increase in earnings/$0.91 TTM earnings) Japan's weaker yen will encourage investment in Japanese markets from foreign investors because they can buy more assets with stronger foreign currencies.</span>Although a prolonged slump in the yen may discourage domestic lending, SMFG is one of the highest exposed Japanese banks to foreign lending, with foreign loans accounting for 27% of the bank's total lending.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>SMFG's foreign exposure is beneficial because the bank can lend in foreign countries, take profits in stronger foreign currencies, and convert back to yen.</span>A share buyback of 100 billion yen would likely boost SMFG's earnings by 2.19%.(100 billion yen * .0084 = $840MM USD) $840MM/$7.85 share price = 107 million shares.6.840 billion in current shares less 107 million = 6.733 billion in new shares.Earnings of $6.248 billion USD / 6.733 billion = $0.93 in earnings after the share buyback.$.02 increase in EPS after the buyback / $0.91 in current TTM EPS = 2.19%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>All told, corporate tax cuts combined with the up to 100 billion yen in share buybacks could boost SMFG's share price by more than 2% in the near term.</span>Because it is very difficult to accurately project banks free cash flows, the more typical method to use when valuing banks is a dividend discount model.(Damodaran, 2009) SMFG's average book value over the last five years was $65.973 billion and the bank's average return on equity was 9.57%.Thus, SMFG's normalized earnings for the last five years was $6.314 billion ($65.973 book value of equity * 9.57% ROE).If it is assumed that SMFG's earnings can grow at 3% per year in perpetuity and the cost of equity is 9%, then the bank's normalized dividend payout ratio is 69%.Source: Damodaran, A. (2009).Valuing Financial Service Firms.New York: NYU Stern School of Business.According to the dividend discount model, SMFG's shares are worth roughly $10.56, which represents 35% upside from current levels.As previously mentioned, the average broker target price for SMFG is $10.18 per share with one Credit Suisse analyst setting a price target of $12.94, which implies 65% upside.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>There are four catalysts that will push SMFG's shares higher.</span>1) The Bank of Japan is injecting $672.53 billion per year into the Japanese economy through the purchase of government bonds.2) Prime Minister Abe is proposing to cut the corporate tax rate from 38% to 30%, which will boost corporate profits.The measure should boost SMFG's earnings by at least 12%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>3) The weaker yen will boost foreign investment from countries like the United States and China because foreign investors can buy more assets with the stronger currencies.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The cheaper currency will also attract tourists because they can travel cheaper and buy more goods with stronger currencies.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The risks of a prolonged slump in the value of the yen are mitigated due to SMFG's large foreign exposure, where it can lend in foreign lands, take profits in stronger currencies, and convert back to yen: SMFG has the second highest foreign exchange exposure among Japanese lenders, with overseas loans accounting for around 27% of the bank s overall lending.</span>4) SMFG will likely issue a share buyback of 100 billion yen by May 2015 that will boost SMFG's stock price by at least 2% in the short term.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The average analyst estimates imply at least 30% upside with more bullish estimates implying upside of 65%.</span>If corporate tax cuts and share buybacks occur within one year, SMFG's stock should appreciate by at least 14%.According to SMFG's dividend discount model, SMFG has at least 35% upside.The Japanese economy is beginning to show life and SMFG will be in the center of the action.Source: Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group: This Japanese Bank Has At Least 35% Upside Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
