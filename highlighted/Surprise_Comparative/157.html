Cramer's Mad Money (3/10/15) | Seeking Alpha Fed might be wrong about raising interest rates.Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Tuesday, March 10.The markets were in a sell mode on Monday.Cramer decides to take a look at what is making investors go out of the market and he can't blame them from wanting to sell.Cramer also believes that nothing earth shattering is happening.He said that markets are nothing like 2008, where he wanted to yell fire and sell everything to get the cash out.There was systemic risk in 2008 when the markets had peaked, which is much different from the current times.The real problem now is the strong dollar which will hurt a lot of companies doing business overseas.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This gets worse if the Fed raises the interest rates.</span>Due to this, the bottom line of multinational companies will be impacted and have their estimates cut.This is still no reason to press the panic button as the consumer sentiment is strong and the banking system has plenty of cash.Cramer recommended investors to start trimming their positions in small portions of stock which are at highest risk if the interest rate continues to rise.Taking profit now will make sense.He added that a downturn following a huge rally is completely normal and investors should stay in the CorpusPath of the inevitable rally.Cramer said that the rant of the strengthening dollar is enough as the dollars in the pocket cannot make money.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So it's better to care about the companies that can make money.</span>Cramer was astonished when Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) announced a $15B buyback and 14% boost in dividends yesterday.He remembered not recommending the stock to investors due to the bomb dropped by management about losing a Samsung contract, in their conference call.Pointing to the stock price decline on Tuesday, he reminded that if a strong company like Qualcomm cannot withstand currency fears, then no one can.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>"I recognize that if there is a trend that defeats my best individual stock ideas, then you have to respect that trend and wait until it reverses, or at least becomes a lot less ferocious," said Cramer.</span>CEO interview - Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) Cramer said that the disappointing automobile sales numbers in February were a fluke, and they are bound to pick up looking at the economy's strength and job hiring.Talking about Ford Motor, he reminded that it was the only company of the big three who did not take bailout funds from the government.The company has cleaned up its balance sheet since then and will see an improved bottom-line as the European economy recovers.He interviewed CEO Mark Fields to find out more.Fields mentioned that the company is very proactive when it comes to business environment.They get together every Thursday to discuss how they can deal with the challenging environment.Commenting on the confidence of the management, he said, "Well, it really comes from keeping our product pipeline full.We launched 24 global products last year, the most we have ever had in our history.Another 15 are coming this year."Fields had a very interesting view on high interest rates.He thinks that a rise in rates is a sign of a healthy economy which will eventually be profitable for the company.When asked about the strong dollar and the weak Brazilian currency, he said, "We have to take the long view here.We have been in Latin America, Brazil and Argentina for 80-plus years.We have been through the ups and the downs, and we will manage our way through this.But the key thing is that we have been very profitable in that part of the world before."Interviewing the football legend Richard Sherman The football star Richard Sherman came on as a mystery guest on the 10th anniversary of Mad Money.Cramer interviewed him and spoke about Sherman's interest in stocks.Apart from that, Sherman mentioned the Richard Sherman foundation and the help they offer to the community.Cramer remembered the rant he made in 2007 that the Fed does not know anything, and how the continuous rate hikes led the economy into recession.Right now, the economy is strong and people are worried about it being overheated.While the Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher has called for an immediate increase in rates, Cramer thinks he is wrong."Right now, he couldn't be more wrong.In fact I would go so far as to say his call to action is dangerous, and it could cause a tremendous downdraft, if not a bear market, in all worldwide equities, along with a dramatic decline in economic activity, if the Fed listens to him."Cramer said that countries like Mexico and Brazil, which already have a weak currency, will be crushed if the Fed were to raise rates."The turmoil out there is so palpable, the ongoing destruction so obvious to me that we might as well be back in August of 2007 when the Fed knew nothing about what was really happening," said Cramer.He thinks that the rise in rates will crush the already fragile growth which will spread as a global turmoil.Cramer agrees with the view of Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer."Right now, if the Fed wants to show us that it knows something this time, and not nothing like the last time, then it should let Stanley Fischer's hand stay steady on the tiller while wishing Richard Fisher well in his coming retirement," said Cramer.Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.Start your FREE 14-day trial now!Get Cramer's Picks by email -
