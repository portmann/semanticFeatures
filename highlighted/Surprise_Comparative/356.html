A High Quality Blue Chip To Be Bought On Dips - HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE:HDB) | Seeking Alpha HDFC bank is the largest private sector bank in India showing consistent 20% CAGR over the last 10 years.The company continues to show steady increase in interest income and decline in bad loans.HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE: HDB ) is a banking company with HDFC Securities Limited and HDB Financial Services Limited as its subsidiaries.The retail banking segment generates the maximum revenue for HDFC.Other segments are treasury, wholesale banking and other operations.HDFC bank is the largest private bank in India.The total assets of the bank stood at 248,950 million INR as of December 2014.The bank released good Q3 results, delivering solidly on revenue and profits, while cutting down on bad loans and NPAs.The bank has been making tremendous efforts to tap in the potential of the rural market.HDB is rated as one of the best banks in India.Though the valuation is not cheap, the management under the leadership of Mr. Aditya Puri has performed excellently over the years.I think that buying HDFC stock is a good way to take advantage of the multi-year Indian bull market which is underway.The Indian banking industry has seen a remarkable growth in the last decade.There has been tremendous increase in deposits, ATMs, credit facilities etc.As a result, the net assets with banks have also increased.Various technological advancements in the form of mobile and internet banking and increase in the disposable income in India are amongst the important factors for this growth.Other fundamental policies by the government, including Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) were also instrumental in the recent growth.According to a report by KPMG, the banking industry in India is set to become the fifth largest banking industry globally by 2020.In FY14, private sector banks experienced significant growth in credit cards and personal loan businesses.1) Universal Bank - HDFC bank provides banking and investment products and services in all three spheres - personal, retail and corporate banking.In addition, the bank is also a leading name in providing insurance and loans in the country.Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) provides loans for fresh purchase or resale, improvement, extension as well as construction of houses.HDFC Standard Life Insurance is a joint venture between HDFC Limited and a group company of the Standard Life Plc, U.K. HDFC Securities is one of the leading stock brokerages in the country.2) Great Financials - HDFC has been growing on all fronts.There has been growth in revenues, loans and deposits.Gross non-performing assets declined to 0.99% from 1.01%, a year ago.There has been a growth in the interest income and decline in bad loans, which led to improved profits for the bank.The net profit reported was 27.9 billion Indian rupees ($450 million) for the quarter ended December 2014, which increased from 23.3 billion rupees from Q3 2013.3) Expanding into the untapped rural Indian market - Most of the urban areas in India have been tapped by leading private and public banks.The rural and semi urban areas in India thus have the potential to be "banked" now.About 55% of HDFC Bank's branches are in the rural and semi-urban areas, up from 34% three years ago.As can be seen from the image below, 56% of the bank's total branches are in the rural areas, while generating just 5% of the total share of revenues.The major challenge before the bank is to now generate revenues from the rural branches.The MD of the bank is well aware of the fact and is already working in that direction.Aditya Puri says, The share of revenues of semi-urban and rural branches will grow from 15 per cent to 35 per cent in the next five years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>4) Digital Banking - The advent of internet and mobile have made the banking experience easier and convenient.</span>HDFC bank is working towards creating a digital banking environment.The bank is not only offering services aiding the daily routine transactions, but it is also offering various products like loans or online account opening facilities.Approximately 85% of customer transaction takes place through non-branch channels.The mobile and internet banking transactions are almost 55%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The bank is thus working towards easing the whole banking experience for its customers by improving and lending more flexibility to its ATM, phone, mobile and internet banking.</span>5) Strong and Experienced Management - Mr. Aditya Puri has been the MD of the bank since its inception in 1994.He has played a vital role in the success story of the bank, also becoming the executive serving a private sector bank for the longest tenure.a) High Valuation - HDFC Bank has always been an expensive stock , given the company's strong fundamentals and high growth trajectory.The company is regarded as one of the top blue chips in India and is one of the investor's favorites for delivering during all phases of the business cycle.With the new business-friendly Modi government in power, HDFC Bank is expected to do even better, as corporate investment and growth picks up.b) Competition remains high - The competition in the Indian banking industry remains quite high.The country not only has foreign, public and private sector banks, but also non-banking finance companies competing on similar lines of business.Its largest competitors are State Bank of India which is owned by the Government and ICICI Bank (NYSE: IBN ) amongst the private sector banks.Moreover, there are new companies entering the industry too.Two new banks - IDFC and Bandhan Group have already received licenses from the RBI Bank.The stock is listed on the US stock market under the ticker "HDB" and has a good track record too.It is currently trading near its all-time high of ~$62.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The stock gave better returns than competition in the last one year.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Its long-term record has been tremendous, growing by more than 1000% in the last one decade.</span>The Indian banking industry is all set to benefit from positive business sentiment, improved consumer confidence and a low inflation environment in India.With a stable government at the Centre, the country is expected to witness various macroeconomic and political reforms.Private sector banks will continue to outpace public sector banks in credit growth.With the GDP set to grow in India, the financial service will also improve in the country.The bank has been showing high double digit consistent growth since the decade and is one of the best-rated banks in terms of service and quality.I think it is a good time to buy HDFC bank during dips, given the strong growth trajectory of the Indian economy over the next decade.Source: HDFC Bank -
