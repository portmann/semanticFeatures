to SA PRO had an early look at this article.Learn more about PRO � LifeVantage (NASDAQ: LFVN ) is a Utah company founded in 2003 on the premise of bringing powerful oxidative stress reduction supplements to the market.Protandim, the company's premier product is at the core of their mission of improving the health of their customers.In 2009, LifeVantage adopted a direct selling model as its distribution method in the US.The switch was a huge success and sales quickly began to skyrocket.Now, in 2015, sales are falling and the company is in dire straits.Revenues, margins and profits are all declining, rapidly.What went right for so long and is now going so wrong?In the initial push to become a viable direct selling company, LifeVantage began recruiting top distributors from other direct selling firms.Eventually this lead to lawsuits, but it was ultimately a successful venture as sales exploded from pre-MLM annual sales of $3.2 million in 2008 to 2014 revenue of $214 million.A 6,588% increase, or 1,098% annually.Investors in any MLM are likely aware of the term "pop and drop."It is an industry term often used to describe the seemingly exponential growth experienced in the beginning years of many multi-level marketers, which is then accompanied by a dramatic drop in sales.The "pop" phase generally occurs 3-8 years after entering a new market, depending on a number of variables.The "drop" usually begins 2-5 years after sales growth explodes.Virtually every MLM experiences this phenomenon.It is caused by the number of distributors rapidly expanding in a given market, then as the overwhelming majority of those distributors fail to earn any substantial income, they drop out of the system.LifeVantage is not unique to this industry trend.In FQ4 (ending June 30th) 2014, LifeVantage revenues peaked.Just 6 months later, after 5 years of rapid growth, sales declined by 14% and the company provided guidance for a FY2015 revenue decline of an additional 11%.Network marketing companies often experience unbelievable growth in their early years, only to rapidly collapse in subsequent years.A number of factors can explain the rapid growth.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Generally speaking the more of a "pyramid" structure in the compensation plan, the quicker sales boom and the sharper the decline.</span>Customers are leaving.Like many multi-level marketers, LifeVantage does not track retail sales.The company does, however, have an "active preferred customer" segment.These are essentially people who purchased products from the company in the previous 3 months, but not enough to qualify as full-time "active distributors."The preferred customer segment does not appear to enjoy the products very much, as the company has steadily lost preferred customers since December 2012.The company believes the loss of "preferred customers" is due to those individuals shifting to active distributor status.But the number of active distributors has also started decreasing.There is no single reason the company is losing distributors, but several elements are likely contributing to the decline.Top distributors are quitting or being terminated and taking their recruiting businesses with them.LifeVantage top distributors, like many MLM top distributors, often utilize recruitment systems known as "tool scams."These businesses recruit prospective entrepreneurs with a business opportunity, frequently promising wealth and financial independence.These systems often operate on the edge of legality, but many MLM's still allow them because they have the ability to recruit many new entrants.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As top distributors who run these schemes leave, fewer new recruits are brought into the company.</span>In June 2014, two of the company's top Japanese distributors were terminated.They have taken a significant portion of their downlines to a new direct selling company.As a result, sales in Japan are collapsing.Prior to adopting a direct selling model, demand for the company's core product, Protandim, was weak.In the 4 years as a traditional retailer, sales ranged from $2.3mm to $7.1mm, Well short of the $214mm of revenue booked in 2014.Protandim previously accounted for 100% of revenue.LifeVantage no longer informs investors as to what percentage of revenue is derived from Protandim, other than stating "we primarily rely on the sale of Protandim� for our revenue."Protandim is a combination of 5 herbs; green tea extract, milk thistle, ashwagandha, bacopa and turmeric.These ingredients are suggested, by LifeVantage, to reduce "oxidative stress."According to the company, this leads to improved focus, increased energy and a variety of other health benefits.LifeVantage is not the only company to sell supplements with these implied health benefits, but its product is one of the most expensive.Protandim is 7X more expensive than comparable supplements.As result, the products are likely difficult to resell at full SRP, reducing any potential income by distributors.Difficulty in reselling products causes distributors to leave the company.In an attempt to diversify the business away from one overpriced supplement, the company introduced two new products in FQ2, an energy drink and a skincare line.Both underwhelmed as sales in the US increased just 1.16%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Doubling the number of products offered, especially in a direct selling company, should have a much greater impact on sales.</span>When products are difficult to resell, distributors often turn to recruiting as a means of earning income.The FTC describes this as a telltale sign of a "pyramid scheme."Many direct sellers have policies in place which aim to prevent distributors from solely focusing on recruiting.Avon (NYSE: AVP ) limits an organizational downline to 3 levels.Tupperware (NYSE: TUP ) bases commissions on retail sales outside the network.LifeVantage does neither.The company recently adjusted the distributor compensation plan to incentivize recruitment.Industry insiders and top distributors know that the laws governing Multi-level marketing are oblique and leave significant room for interpretation.One fundamental rule, however, is not to pay a direct fee for the recruitment of new distributors.On February 1, 2015, LifeVantage amended their compensation plan to make several "enhancements."The infinite fast start bonus became effective March 2, 2015.This bonus rewards $210-$260 for the sale of expensive starter packs that range from $630-$999.According to the Utah Pyramid Scheme Act , "Pyramid scheme means any sales device or plan under which a person gives consideration to another person in exchange for compensation or the right to receive compensation which is derived primarily from the introduction of other persons into the sales device or plan rather than from the sale of goods, services, or other property."Full disclosure, I'm not a lawyer, but I interpret the above statute to specifically ban the direct payment for recruitment.Other highly debated MLM firms, such as Herbalife (NYSE: HLF ) and Nu Skin (NYSE: NUS ) pay recruiting rewards that are based on the volume purchased by downline recruits.This incentives recruitment, but does not pay for it directly.It appears LifeVantage is now directly paying its distributors for starter packs, which are primarily for new recruits.Investors should be extremely cautious, as the SEC/FTC could initiate an investigation and/or enforcement action at any time.A company spokesperson noted that the enhancements do not violate the Utah law because the packages contain some products in addition to the marketing materials.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If LifeVantage is indeed violating anti-pyramid scheme laws, this may provide a catalyst for more top distributors to leave the company.</span>What ethical individual wants to be a part of an organization that may be breaking the law?The Chief Science Officer is Under an FTC Injunction .In 2014, LifeVantage hired Shawn Talbott PhD as the company's Chief Science Officer.In 2004, Mr. Talbott was sued by the FTC for making false and misleading medical claims regarding a product he had developed.He settled the charges in 2005, paying a penalty of $1.12 million.The settlement also placed Mr. Talbott under a permanent injunction, barring him from making any unsubstantiated medical claims in the future.A key component of Mr. Talbott's position at LifeVantage is suggesting various health benefits associated with consuming the products.Many of the "clinical studies" to support his claims are funded by the company and show little direct link between the products and the attributable health claims.Prospective distributors who conduct an online search of Mr. Talbott will find his FTC injunction as the third result on Google.Hiring someone under an FTC injunction is bad PR and bad for distributor retention.Products that are difficult to resell, a compensation plan that may be non-compliant with applicable laws and an executive team that doesn't inspire confidence are all negatively affecting recruiting abilities.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If LifeVantage is unable to dramatically improve recruitment by their next quarterly filing, Investors should abandon the stock, as it will go much lower.</span>Currently, LFVN is having a horrible year.Shares are down 40% ytd and 45% over the past 52 weeks, despite the company buying back $8.6m of stock in 2014.There is still an additional $4.4mm allowance under the current buy back for 2015.In 2014, LifeVantage reported record revenue and profits.Revenue of $214mm and net income of $11.4mm equated to $0.11 EPS.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Forward guidance was much lower, however, with projected 2015 revenues between $185mm and $195mm and EPS of $0.06-$0.08.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For the first two quarters of the fiscal year the company posted $0.06 diluted EPS, implying they expect to earn less than $0.02 for the rest of the year.</span>That is a 50% decline over 2014.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Historically, many MLM's have experienced much sharper declines once the peak in sales is reached, so it is likely the company will post negative EPS for the next two quarters, dragging FY2015 results below $0.06 per share.</span>EPS below 0.06 would produce a stock price south of $0.48 at 8X 2015 earnings, a 40% decline from current levels.Deteriorating operations in key markets, questionable recruiting practices, declining distributors and preferred customers will all combine to significantly weigh on future revenues and profits.The meaningful decline in shares will likely continue throughout the year and could result in a delisting from the NASDAQ.This business is falling apart and investors should get out while they can.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than
