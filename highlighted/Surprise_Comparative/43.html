(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iOS Research Kit most likely will have the greatest impact on the world.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) had a lot of extraordinary technology to show off at its big event Monday.Of course the Apple Watch received the most attention - and rightfully so.Also of note was the intro of the new MacBook.The technological innovation here is absolutely phenomenal!(Or am I just too much of a tech geek?)From the screen to the trackpad to the very keyboard keys, the level of new and innovative design is amazing.I highly recommend the four-minute design video .Another astounding announcement that most likely will have the greatest impact on the world is the iOS Research Kit .This will forever change how some forms of medical research are done, something that goes far beyond Apple and the gadget world altogether.Tim Cook likes to use the word "transforming."If ever it were appropriate then it is so here.(You can watch the event video - skip to 15:00 to get to this part.)Mark Hibben has an excellent round up here .With all the talk about products, one of the most brilliant moves has seen relative little press - yet is very important to the investor.This is the partnership with HBO (a division of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX )) for the upcoming launch of HBO Now.(See site .)HBO Now is a video on demand service, that gives access to HBO's library of original programs, films and other content on computing devices and digital media players.While HBO Go is for those subscribed to HBO via their cable TV provider, HBO Now circumvents the cable company by giving access directly via the internet.The service was announced at the Apple event by HBO CEO Richard Plepler, and will cost $15 per month.(See event video at 5:00 mark) The big news for Apple investors, however, is that for the first three months, HBO Now will be exclusive to Apple.Because this means is that if you do not have access to HBO via your cable provider and want to watch the Game of Thrones series as they come out, then you will need to have an Apple device.And Apple has made this very easy.They just lowered the price of the Apple TV from $99 to $69.Now, for $69 people will be introduced to the Apple ecosystem, and we all know that once introduced to the Apple ecosystem, people have a tendency to stay in it.On top of that, HBO is now providing a tremendous amount of promotion for Apple.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It is a special kind of promotion in that it carries more weight than a traditional ad.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We all know that any commercial is presented by a company, but since this comes from a third party (HBO) it is viewed as more impartial.</span>Those not in the Apple system are more likely to view the Apple TV positively because of this.I argued earlier that Apple sees the Apple TV as an important strategic product to become the hub of the home electronic system, hosting not only the customer's audio/video system, but the also whole home automation system via HomeKit.Tim Cook announced that so far Apple has sold 25 million of the set-top boxes.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is certainly a push to sell more particularly to those currently outside the Apple system.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Apple's new partnership with HBO is one more in a line of many, and illustrates one of the key strengths Apple has always had and that has been an important contributor to its success.</span>This is long-term, strategic planning.With this deal, Apple is slowly building for the future.And when the future comes, the Apple TV will already be in scores of millions of households.Source: Apple's Most Brilliant Move Is Not The Watch Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
