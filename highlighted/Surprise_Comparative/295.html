SO expects the EPS for 2015 to be in a range of $2.72-$2.80/share .Due to cost overruns and delays, the company lowered its earnings growth target range to 3%-4% from 4%-5% for the future.Analysts have anticipated that SO's earnings will grow by approximately 3.61% over the next 5 years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Along with current investments in long-term growth generating projects, the company will continue to look into all possible opportunities to make more capital investments in several growth generating projects.</span>Also, SO, in the recent Q4'14 conference call, provided its planned 2017 capital expenditures.The company has projected a CAPEX of $16.6 billion for a three-year period from 2015 to 2017, as shown in the chart below.SO has a strong history of making healthy cash returns to its shareholders by paying hefty dividends.In fact, due to the company's hefty dividend payment policy, the stock has earned an attractive dividend yield of 4.60% .Moreover, SO is fully committed to following its healthy dividend payment formula in the years ahead; in the Q4'14 earnings conference call, the company's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Arthur Bettie, said : We feel very confident in our ability to deliver sustainable dividend policy as we have in the past into the future.Owing to the management's commitment towards making healthy dividend payments and due to its strong strategic growth initiatives directed at improving the company's cash flow base, I believe that SO's dividends remain secure.The ongoing increase in construction costs due to delays occurring at both Kemper and Vogtle projects will continue to pressurize the company's cost base in upcoming years.Moreover, increased environmental expenditure due to regulatory restrictions and decline in power demand due to weather changes are key risks hovering over SO's future stock price performance.I am downgrading SO from a 'buy' to 'hold' due to ongoing construction challenges.The company's near-term performance will be pressurized due to construction delays in its two main projects.However, as the company will complete its ongoing construction projects, its business risk profile will improve and portend well for the stock valuation.The company's ongoing robust investments in several solar projects will also add towards the growth of its long-term earnings trajectory.The ongoing challenges faced by the company due to construction delays and cost overruns will keep pressure on the stock valuation.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The stock is currently trading at a lower forward P/E of 15x, as compared to the utility sector's forward P/E of 16.8x , which I believe is justified due to ongoing construction challenges and an increase in its business risk profile.</span>Source: Construction Delayed, Bringing Down Southern Company's Rating From Buy To Hold Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
