Financial Officer of Porsche Automobil Holding SE Christian Klingler - Functional Responsibility 'Sales and Marketing' Member of the Board of Management of the Volkswagen brand Functional Responsibility 'Sales, Marketing and After Sales' [Interpreted] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.Also on behalf of the Investor Relations team, I would like to bid you welcome to Berlin to our Investor Relations Conference, Investor Press Conference.This morning Professor Winterkorn and Mr. Pötsch have outlined the strategy and the business development of the Volkswagen Group.Surely, some questions have remained on the part of investors and analysts, which we will take now with pleasure.I would like to ask you to give us a show of hand if you have questions.Please wait for the arriving mike.Tell us your name and your affiliation.Naturally you may put your question in English, the answers will be in English, but will be translated.[Interpreted] Good afternoon, it’s Adam Hull from Berenberg.Three questions if I may.The first question is on the Chinese JV.I understand you had a cash dividend of around €3.0 billion last year.I assume this is after tax.And could you give us some feel of what it might be this year, I understand it’s being negotiated or considered pretty shortly, even if that’s just in renminbi terms?I’m presuming it will be sharply up given the 20% rise so in the Chinese profits.Secondly, on your revenue guidance of up to 4%, there’s some pretty dramatic FX moves recently.Could you just help us a little bit with that sort of struck two months ago, six months ago, using the average FX rates of the last sort of six months or something like that?On the revenue obviously that falls straight through, the spot numbers come through.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then finally on plug-in hybrids and in terms of your pricing strategy, am I right in thinking that your broad assumption is that the gross margins are similar to your other cars and therefore it’s a question of just passing through that higher costs to the customers, is that the right way of thinking, maybe you could help us on sort of your pricing strategy on some of these new technologies.</span>Thank you.[Interpreted] First, let me take your question pertaining to the dividend which naturally is an after tax dividend.For 2015, we expect again to have a result on par with the previous year, a comfortable amount.As you’ve seen yourself let me add the liquidity position and the income that we’ve achieved - earnings we’ve achieved would make such a thing possible.However, the enormous investments which we keep undertaking in China are done using the cash flow generated locally.And as we can take these upfront CapEx measures on the basis on that the payout is then decided.Your second question on the guidance for the sales revenue, we base this assumption going forward on the premise of the hedging position that we hold currently to hedge FX exposure and the position the items we have and the assumptions on further developments as feared in Russia and Tier 2 developments in South America, particularly in Brazil, and also, with a view to the so called FBU business in China.We assume or we expect that conservative assumptions, little revenue will be generated from the volume development.The vehicles built in China are not counted as part of this sales revenue.It is only the assemblies and components that’s needed to build these vehicles and so we have an exchange rate driven problem and development.The current development has not been taken into account to the full extent yet.On your third question pertaining to the pricing of our hybrid vehicles, of course, we are trying to generate a positive margin contribution.We try to come up with a positive margin or in other words relay the costs into the market as they are occasioned by this particular type of vehicle.For competition reasons we will not comment on any detail.[Interpreted] Thank you.Michael Raab.Do you want me to take this in English or German?German, please.Michael Raab from Kepler Cheuvreux.Can I come back to what you pointed out the target under MQB to reduce direct on a cost over the life cycle by up to 20% of the previous model.When asked the question last year, Mr. Garcia Sanz, he said, already achieved 17% reduction a year ago at this juncture, where are you now.The answer for the new ramp ups that started this year were between 18% and 19%, so we’re getting close to the 20%, and we’re confident that for the MQB we will manage to achieve this.[interpreted] Thank you, Anthony House.I have two questions a little more strategic nature to ask of Dr. Winterkorn.Should results considered in the next of two go down to 75 grams of CO2 by 2030, what that mean for the powertrain concept in the Volkswagen Group 2025.So is that delivered to value added chain in the automotive industry?The second question is Porsche SE, whether the present structure is really sustainable or whether it wouldn’t be advantageous to simply merge Porsche SE into Volkswagen.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We have discussed this earlier on or before there are clear reason that would be case with - that would perhaps be question to ask a few Mr. Pötsch, if you could comment on this?</span>Another question for Mr. Pötsch, it would be very helpful if you could give us the net exchange rate exposure according to currencies.BMW and Daimler does it, so it’s an industrial standard, so I do not quite understand why this is such a secret here at Volkswagen?Thank you.[interpreted] Mr. Ringos [ph], I think I said this morning already that, and I see that the European automotive industry have always been working pretty clearly to get it across Brussels that we can only discuss the next target if we know that we can attain the present target by 2020.95 grams by 2025 cannot be done without E-mobility vehicles, hybrid vehicles.And this is also the case with the diesel.It’s often blamed to be such a polluter in much of the problem.So we will continue to boost the hybrid technology in order to meet our goals by 2020.Of course, our goal is set that by 2016/2017, we can stay, do this up-taking in order to see what the next steps could possibly be.As we heard, I think with our products and with our platforms, with our drivetrain, so we are well aligned strategically speaking in order to optimize the diesel vehicles and optimize them in order to make also CNG vehicles possible with the terms, with the modular kit and the terms with modular kit is also designed in such a way that it could even accommodate fuel cells.So these are the drive options that we are going into.And the upfront investment is quite tremendous, so we need, of course, also a license program in order to be able to maintain the result as is.So let me continue with the question concerning the group structure.I understand your question to the extent that this is a question to ask of Volkswagen, because there is not a question to ask of Porsche I take it.So from the Volkswagen perspective, the situation is quite clear and the original project of a merger we considered it so-called basic agreement with the plurality of different parties.Now, this is expired now this agreement.And I could not see any realistic basis for such an agreement coming up again in the foreseeable future.The merger is not an uptick for us.The other question was about currency exposure - exchange rate exposure.And here let me say quite clearly, sometime ago, we have considered currency items that hedge relevant position, and that is why we cannot communicate any data on this.And if I may say, concerning us the present development in the exchange rate has rather confirmed this assessment of mine.Jose Asumendi, JPMorgan, a few questions, please.The first one, could you comment please a little bit on the receivables move in the fourth quarter?It looked to me like an inflow, if there was any exceptional item there?Second, on provisioning, could you comment if provisioning had any kind of impact on earnings, substantial impact on earnings at year end?And third element, I’m just thinking about the delta between the fixed costs and the cost savings.And it looks to me like on Audi there is a large negative of around €500 million.Overall, for the Volkswagen Group, it looks to me like it’s balanced.So there must be a positive offsetting factor within one of the brands that is offsetting the negative of Audi, bearing, I guess, the brunt of the new technology investments.Is this related to ŠKODA, could you give us some details behind that?And the final one for Mr. Garcia Sanz, please.Could you talk a bit about the cost saving cycle?When do you expect to achieve the sweet-spot of cost savings?Is this related to the number of units you have on the MQB platform?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I mean, is this going to give you a bigger opportunity to negotiate bigger cost savings with suppliers?</span>Thank you.[interpreted] Let me first talk about receivables.Here we do not have any extraordinary effects, special items.Of course, the question is to how receivables developed so fast as to with the payment attitude?And is the business transacted by financial services is relevant here, so there are no special extraordinary effects here.This may simply vary and fluctuate between quarters.And similar answer, I would have to get to the question concerning the provisions made, there are no specific topics on the table.We have released provisions and formed new ones, as always, so nothing out of the normal so to speak that would prevent the reporting.The ratio between fixed cost and cost improvements, it’s slightly negative.It’s round about €200 million, and here we have a somewhat varying picture depending on the bran.Yes, indeed, in the case of ŠKODA, the ratio is relatively positive.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The high shares of the used MQB modular kit concerning the bigger space on it, certainly plays an important and supporting role here in this respect.</span>And I should also mention that, we have a negative special effect with Fiat which we have posted, without which the ratio between fixed cost to product cost savings has been almost completely offset.[Interpreted] Concerning product costs, there is no sweet spot with the reduction.We said we only have 20% reduction, compared to the old Golf.And with the first startup production of the Golf III, we had a first step, because here together with the development and the design of the platform was already less expensive than the one of the predecessor model.Then we entered into framework agreements, blanket agreements with the suppliers, which, of course, were based on increased volumes.And this cost regression, the effect of course was then forwarded to us.And we hope that now we can reach with AE platform our target of 20%.But this does not mean that we will have further cost savings that can be attained by taking further product cost measures and continuing to working in an intelligent manner and smart manner on the raw materials market, and that we also may produce of an utilization methods with our suppliers, which would then be rolled over to us, but the next steps to come will not be that big, as we had them already.Now, I would like to add something to this, because there were a few questions on the MQB.Let me remind you of the factors often discussed with you that ultimately our unit cost reductions still has already been attained.But I always pointed out the part of these savings in the sense of premium scores were rolled over to our customers.Anybody, if you had the possibility of driving this, because knows what is this about and I say so in order to make sure that there is not a misconception that we including everything, what really have a reduction of 20% concerning unit cost.That was the first point.To the second point let me remind you of the fact that the effect of the MQB vehicles can only be reaped, or can only be have an effect on the income statement of the different brands.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the same manner as the MQB based vehicle will have a greater and greater share of the total number of cars built.</span>Let me say here that in ŠKODA in 2014, we have here a ratio of about 35%, whereas that Volkswagen passenger costs in order to give you the other extreme we are at about 16% to 17% in 2014.So if you want to have proof of how these effects are taken into just because it’s always take a lot at ŠKODA, because here I have the highest share of MQB based vehicles.Hi there, it’s Mike Tyndall from Barclays.Two questions if I may, the first is probably to Mr. Klingler.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I want to understand a bit about Russia and Brazil, because those markets are clearly panning out to be worse than we expected.</span>Can you talk about the base level of volumes you need to have to keep your dealer network afloat?Presumably there is a level where if we go below that things start to look a bit sketchy for them.So I’m wondering what level that might be if you can share that with us?And then the second question is to Mr. Pötsch with regards to future track.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You’ve mentioned that we’re going to get more than €1 billion in 2015.</span>I wondered if you could share what the number was 2014, and should we just think about 2016 and 2017, the developments accelerating, how will that progress?And perhaps in that line, can you talk about your - the realization versus the expectation?Is it working out better than you originally thought or is it in fact tough to find the savings?Thanks.[Interpreted] I’ll try to give you some information on the markets, Brazil and Russia.Our comments with Brazil, which saw a multitude of factors creating a less optimistic forecast or assessment of the market, first of all, you’ve got the economic development and trends, which are critical.Interests have risen sharply and consequently individual customers find it increasingly difficult to refinance their purchases.At the same time the government programs, I repeated, are have been phased out at end of the year, and the situation in the truck sales context are very difficult and the pre-conditions are no longer in place as we saw them before.And there is unrest in the country, so that we assess the situation as critical to tell you the truth, and the markets are contracting.This massively concerns passenger cars, and this is massively affects the truck business as well.We assume that be downward trend will not continue with the steepness of that contraction of that weathering of the situation, whether this will be a long term problem, something I can’t tell you.However, it will not be months, we assume but this will remain a rocky ride of the next two to three years in terms of the economic framework conditions and the market in Brazil.Let me add that Brazil is not alone.There is a continent which is of consequence, the situation in Argentina did nothing to help our business there, it’s not a very pleasant development there.We foresee in the foreseeable future that there will be a - see change in the trends.So there is a link with Brazil, with that market as well.When it comes to Russia, here we’re in a situation which not only politically speaking is caused by the causes we have in place for 18 months.We’ve seen the economic downturn, which continues accelerate even, that contraction up until the end of last year.We had the almost expected inflation run, let me put it that way.Customer said were simply before I leave the money in my pocket or buy something, a product, a good which make sense anyway to compensate for inflation, this is led to upfront purchases, proactive purchases up until the end of December.That brings us to a critical situation with negative growth rates throughout the market.And over the next two years, we do not expect any dramatic improvements here to put things out there quite clearly.And we’ve reacted to this flagging demand, to come back to your dealer network question; it’s not a question of the volume, but of the terms and conditions as an aggregate total.And of course we’ll ensure that we prepare the dealer network for the times when things pick up again, look up again in Russia.Russia reacts very quickly after economic downturns after going through the bottom - it recovers then very quickly and we’ll be ready for that.[Interpreted] Let me continue by taking your questions and answering them on our future trucks program, with relation to our diverse efficiency programs we have in place.Let me begin with the prospects after - the developments after 2014.In spring, tailor-made this program and we started working with it.And I can only thank our colleagues who present, particularly those sitting in the first row.My complements and recognition for ensuring widespread acceptance throughout the company after a very short notice in a very short period, particularly since we’ve made it quite clear to our workforce, that we’re not doing that - no more principles and cutting things across the board, but we’ll have to prepare for structural changes and to maintain our success it is necessary to implement these programs across the board without faltering.If we had not that you focused on developments at the VW brand we wouldn’t have succeeded in the way we did, as you’ve referred to that point.And I’d like to pick up the statement of Mr. Klingler, particularly in the countries like Russia and South America, Brazil and Argentina we increasingly see problems and difficulties with a bottom line impact, relative to the figures plan.So excluding the effect from the efficiency programs things would have looked dire.It would have been impossible to achieve the earnings we’ve achieved for the brand VW.And as we started very energetically in 2014, of course, the base effects have repercussions into 2015.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And I can tell you that more than €1 billion is the effective contribution into the result of the brand and would secure the earnings situation of the brand.</span>It is not a given, we cannot just rest in our line complacently, because Russia and Brazil and these market developments will be on the tops of our minds and will be a concern, remains so.And in Russia it’s very difficult from today’s point of view to really foresee where things are headed.But one thing quite clearly, in a year from now, we will not tell you that we been successful with the efficiency program, but our earnings situation didn’t match the target.We will continually adjust the severity of these programs to buffer kind development wherever they come from.On to your question, on whether everything is running smoothly or whether it’s an uphill battle.Well, I’d say in two parts.First, looking at the figures, you know that we planned €5 billion for the brand.We have achieved around about half.With view to 2017, continually new topics are added on a daily basis basically, so we are confident there.However, this is only possible by working hard.And when I say working hard, let me add on some of the strange press reports that we’ve been reading.Let me put it this way.Presumably, the problem wouldn’t run efficiently and be effective.If it didn’t, then it will be clear that things would be quiet.So it’s no wonder that some people feel that was stepped on their toes and sometimes there are upheavals and problematic things are published.We have wide approach that from the labor representatives side and we are confident that we can deliver.[Interpreted] Thank you.Jochen Gehrke from Deutsche Bank.First, a question for Mr. Renschler.Obviously, you just joined the fray and joined the team in Volkswagen Group.And it will be nice if you could give us a first impression of the brands and what are the core problems you see and you want to tackle with this next six to nine months.Particularly for MAN, the return on investments, margins are much below the planned target, what are the key levers you intent to use to forge ahead with that brand?And then a question that goes to Mr. Pötsch.Coming back to currency exchange rate, this year of course, that development can go the other way as well.Works both ways and unless it does, we have seen the global motor industry, but particularly the Japanese after this yen dropped to a totally new level of returns and what’s your take on this?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Do you expect German companies to be able to reposition themselves upward or will those be the famous tailwinds that ensure that on other sides you don’t have the same efficiency and you just hand it down to customers more than you like do that today?</span>My third point, you mentioned that you don’t really want to completely plan, but it’s clear that as only the other side has spoken out, I don’t want to talk about that, but about the means appropriation you’ve got payout ratio targets of 30%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>They’ve been around for years and we are really progressing in very small steps in deed and the shareholders are getting paid less than you get from the Chinese joint ventures.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For the view just 2017 and 2018 do you plan to take bigger steps or are we still talking about sub-1% payout ratios.</span>Thank you.[Interpreted] Let me start with the commercial vehicle topic.I am in deed a new kid on the block.First weeks here, as I mentioned before were categorized many new things I had to get to know the brands, MAN, including Latin America, but also Scania and VW commercial vehicles, [not sotsiger] [ph].Something I learned is I found a lot of competent people with the skill-sets and the will to drive forward topics and concepts and that’s [indiscernible].And in the meantime we’ve been able to create a sense of new beginning and that was very important for preparing the future to know for the truck people that we are intending to drive forward the truck business.As I have explained earlier on, first and foremost, we need to look into the restructuring issues, what we started with the takeover of Scania and these possibilities to control things to merge these things into a truck holding, we are working on that.And over the next weeks or months we expect to finalize that.And again as much independence as necessary for the brands to have the effective customers that they need and as many things in common is possible to leverage economies of scale and savings potential from both brands.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If you go down one level and if you enter greater detail level when it comes to the brands, of course, there has been some cutting up that MAN had to do when it comes to Euro 6.</span>And today they’ve reached a level where they are very competitive already to put it that way.And the second thing is as announced yesterday, the necessity to trigger an efficiency program and this is currently being negotiated and agreed and rolled out to everyone concerned.And that’s a necessary step but this is only indirectly connected to the overall topic.The operation MAN needs to do something.They’ve prepared for that, and they implemented part of that and that will really kick off in a concrete implementation phase over the next couple of months.Otherwise, MAN has an excellent reputation and a strong tradition and track record on when we want to strengthen that with the efficiency measure to forge ahead again.Scania, things here surely look different if you’re involved with the commercial vehicles, you might have followed this already.Scania and MAN has different customer segments it caters - they cater to MAN.It’s very strong in the building sites area of around 75% overall.For Scania it’s almost not involved here, so we have little overlap.And now we need to sound out these differences to forge ahead for the two brands, and of course, generate growth.So in a nutshell I got lot of support on the part of Volkswagen anyway, but also from the brands.And now this is about implementing the structures, putting them in place so that we can start working quickly and start really implementing things.Those are the tasks ahead.[Interpreted] Right, I’ll pick up the question of the effects of the currency exchange rate scenario.Well, here surely, we’ve got to bear in mind, that for exporting companies for car OEMs, motor companies it is a fundamentally positive contribution or effect, otherwise let us not go overboard.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We know what this is driven by and this sort of movement can turn back as quickly as it started, whether it comes back to earlier levels remains to be seen.</span>We remain conservative and cautious with the view to this, however be on doubt, if the scenario did exist for long time and significantly over the next month the hedging volume would be reduced.Then when it comes to export we would have a different earnings quality.On your question on lease plan, I hope you understand that I’ll not comment on this.And you asked me to comment on possible funds appropriation and allocation.I will do that very briefly and take you through some things without focusing directly or referring to lease plan directly.Just refer to the quite satisfactory net liquidity €17.6 billion at the end of 2014.And please let me remind you of the fact that the topics that are obviously on the table, we have an offer out there on the table for MAN shareholders, which will come into effect as soon as all shareholders avail themselves of this offer, then we’ll be talking about amounts of beyond €3 billion.Second, as you are aware, we are engaged in talks with our Chinese partner in the north of the country with a view to possibly increasing our interest held in that joint venture and it’s difficult to say when this will come about.However, when it does, it’s an extremely successfully venture and company up there.Cash flow producing successful and it is obvious, that it will not be cheap to increase our share in that company.The third element, please don’t forget to take that into account, we have passed the stress test on the financial side with excellence and recognition.There is not a problem with the equity provision in the FX area.However, let me give you my impression on this, to my mind, the whole system of stress test is not stable.On an ongoing basis, the regulators come up and ventilate new ideas.Additional parameters more stringent and exacting parameters, and so although the business case remains robust from a regulatory side further requirements on equity can be set for that any point in time.And of course financing growth is important to consider.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So much on what do we do with our liquidity and of course we have on our radars our obligation to improve the payout, to increase payout, could say that the step in terms of the ratio was fairly low, but we are paying 20% more than last year.</span>Consider it from this angle, and please bear with us, as we try to strike a balance between - we have to strike a balance there.On the one hand as we mentioned earlier on, we have massive efficiency programs with repercussions on everyone throughout the group and of course we want to have the shareholder’s part taken the success of the company.We believe we did strike the right balance and there is no mention that we will continue these incremental improvements of just 1%, we didn’t say that, didn’t mean that.We will go from the 30%, and we’ve reiterated that, and whatever this would be driven by, there is a more - some upside potential going forward compared to this year.[Interpreted] [indiscernible] I have also a few questions, a number of questions, and also a request.Respective with the earnings that which you make available for the group, and volume price mix another topic, what struck me that, between the return on sales or sales revenue expectation and this factor there is no correlation.So basically I don’t understand what the price mix does.Maybe they’ve other effects contained in this graph and Mr. Pötsch said that the others items also have an effect on this.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And it could be separate as what you have a category others for the passenger cars division, so that we can read in a better manner what the actual effect is of this sales fluctuations on earnings.</span>In this context I would like to ask the following question, how - what was the price mix ultimately in 2014.Is it correct to say that price mix all-in-all had a positive effect and what would be the outlook for 2015 concerning this particular point?And if I take a look at the first two months, it seems to me that Volkswagen has somewhat lost a few market shares.If this is the trend which will continue in 2015, so should we consider 2015 rather a year of transition, so that focus will be more on the - that last year was more modest that were important now with small profitability.Last question concerning the Volkswagen brand, if I take everything together, also take a look at the trends of 2014, which increased from quarter-to-quarter, improved that is, am I right in assuming that, if we take Q4 as a basis 3% margins that this cannot really deteriorate greatly in 2015 even if future tax savings will be taken into account?[Interpreted] Let me mention the factors concerning market share.You may know that the Volkswagen brand compared to the other brands of the group, it is much more committed in Russia and in South America.And you can see also clear effects, which you can derive from this.So this declining trend in both markets is something that we also exposed to.So we try to respond by pricing, which may give rise to additional losses in market shares, particularly in Russia with example.And this had harsh repercussion on the brand as whole and [indiscernible] in regards market share, positioned us quite stable and positive.So we can see that in the rest of the world we’re also relatively well aligned, until we have yet another effect, which can be observed in China.In China, the number of the Chinese brands is increasing clearly and considerably.Our active in segments, which are clearly below our price range and here, of course, it’s very difficult to have a share in this.But the main effect that you observe is that both in South America, Brazil and Argentina, that is and also the effects from Russia have these effects which we have just outlined.Then I’d like to continue with your requests, which you’ve mentioned here.And we’re willing to consider this, and let me give you another remark in this respect now.Whenever we try to translate unit figures, volume figures, and the value consideration in this column and the bridge volume mix prices, then you must bear in mind, and consider that as regards Audi vehicles, for example, we have also a considerable contribution in this value category on the basis of CKD set that we sent to China, which in the volume line, in the corresponding volume line is not displayed or reflected.And this is a main element, which becomes relevant whenever the volume development is stood in China has been relatively flat, which was the case in 2014 by the way.Moreover, I can confirm that the topics of the price mix both in 2014 were positive, but also for the beginning of 2015, and this is also our expectation.We have positive exception for 2015.As we got - what will come in 2015, we’re in line with our presentation of last year, which refer to qualitative growth, we are focusing on the implementation of the efficiency schemes and programs, which we have large improvement of earnings quality that is.I will forgo listing them up all now, all the elements that have to be taken into account from an entrepreneurial point of view.I just want to point out that this is absolute top priority for us.As outlined before on account of this efficiency programs the brand could clearly improve over the past year quarters as you just said and we hope that we can link up to this tendency.Usually, I must say it would be easy to sit here and say we will improve.Unfortunately I have to make the following comment, which you also find in our guidance namely that we have the situation in Russia and South America, where we have situations which are very difficult to assess only to a limit and extent can we say what will happen there.For the rest on the basis of the programs we should able to link up to what we have delivered in 2014.Thank you, Stephen Reitman from Société Générale in London.Two questions, please.The first one on Russia, I understand your engine plant is immediately going to come into production.How do that change you’re thinking about Russia?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I’m thinking particularly if I compare it to India, where I understand your exports are significantly greater than your domestic sales.</span>So here you used the situation where you have a relatively low cost production side.Market hasn’t come through, so you’re using that as an export base.And I understand so will Russia improve in that kind of way, obviously sanctions are an issue, but is there some hope that we could see some progress on that?My second is about Volkswagen passenger cars.I think it’s very clear from all your presentations today and everything you say, how you stress, how conservative your planning is.And I think taking Mr. Klingler’s comments as well about low expectations of any improvements in Brazil or Russia in the next two years into account is clear that is not going into your planning as well.But still you repeat in your presentations that you are committed to getting to, at least, the 6% margin on Volkswagen passenger cars by 2018 of the latest.So what I would like to understand, given that, you’re certainly not factoring in, so these physical markets are going to improve.What are the real steps beyond the future tracks that give you the confidence that you can actually make these big leaps, which by your last comments going to basically, necessarily expect in 2015.So what is coming in 2016 and 2017 that really gives the step up?Thank you.[Interpreted] Let me start with a question concerning Russia and possible impact regarding our investments in the engine plant there.Let me say, first of all, that after intensive discussions, we have clearly decided to implement a project as planned.You may know that with the Russian government, we have entered into a so-called decree which agreed in such a decree, which lays down the conditions for the import of vehicles and our components.And that for this certain local content requirements needs to be met, this contains the decree.Now, we do not want to deviate from this basic plan, if I may, call it like this.The underlying idea, of course, is that in Russia I have to be wary now.But in Russia a considerable market will remain for which it will be worthwhile producing vehicles on side in Russia.Talking specifically concerning the topic engine factory - engine plant, the engine plant is an important contribution in order to enhance the local content.But measured against normal conditions this engine factory and the present day situation really doesn’t help us to improve the situation.In this plant, we will need to have to fly parts from other countries, because under present conditions, it’s not still very easy to make suppliers move their established companies there, which will then supply to our engine plant.Now, this situation, of course, gives rise to a certain limit concerning the idea, which we also consider, i.e., not only to use this plant for the Russian markets alone, but to supply drivetrains or complete vehicles from out of Russia into other countries.So we would have to observe how the development, or what are the developments will be.You referred to this that there have been positive experience just in India.And we have to see how stabilization will be and we rely on this, what will be the development of the general environmental conditions also for suppliers to be attracted into Russia.So this is something that we need to observe continually Volkswagen passenger cars.Your question was now whenever there were any difficult situations, what were then enable us here to sit down here, in front of you and to say with confidence that we would certainly attain the level of 6%.While this indeed has to do with the fact that with the above mentioned programs, we are well aligned and we’re positioned.I should have started by saying that, we see that the new vehicles are fantastic, and way they function.You may note that we have a lot of test reports for a long time.So the customers respond and customer satisfaction figures are quite inspiring.And we wouldn’t be Volkswagen if we did not also integrate sufficient latitude in this progress, room for maneuver for something which we perhaps did not expect, things that come unexpected where we are unaware.So the only consideration is where this latitude, there is room for maneuvers suffice in order to compensate for possible negative developments either in Russia or South America.I think that it would not be very critical if I were to tell you now, what the future situation in Russia and Brazil would be like that remains to be seen.The factors, as I said before, as we try to remove tensions from this progress and adjust in such a manner that we will be able to master the situation - any situation that may arise.And that is why I say that we will be able to achieve the 6% as promised.May I also add to this Mr. Pötsch said or referred to the efficiency program and then on to it, we also have other vehicles on an MQB basis, which will be launched to the market.Last year, we had to go, i.e., Volkswagen brunt.This year, we also have the smallest fund fully available to overcome, so it’s also fully available, but thought us well the Sedan and the Convertible, the Station Wagon also.Then the Polo will also come, so I think that this topic of the new product, which are well accepted by our customer base with cost base inspire us with open to make us be confident that we will be able to attain our goals.Thank you.There are few more requests for the floor but we are pressed for time.Juergen Pieper was the next one in the fifth row, and Charles also the fifth row.[Interpreted] Juergen Pieper from Metzler Capital Markets.Two little follow-up questions on China, I understood you and some of your representative has been generally that to have high expectations with the view to the New Year shopping season and you kept that cars intentionally to the part of the - for the sales, now the sales figures don’t look that impressive 3%, 4% of the growth figures while we are doing in Audi, perhaps say below your expectations in China, most vehicle classes are coming under pressure if you believe the people in the no, too agreed.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then to Mr. Pötsch, the equity ratio has dropped some or even considerably, is that a definite lower threshold where you would say, we need a capital measure if we came below that particular thresholds?</span>Thank you.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>[Interpreted] Well, in China, when you consider the two - first two months we have some of the effects coming in first of all under the bottom line, the overall market is - has grown more than ever expected 16% to give you an order of magnitude, we didn’t expect to grow so much.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Of course, if you consider us many factors of influence have a bearing on this as Mr. Klingler already mentioned, in the first two months, we have a pronounced growth of segments in which we are not a bunch of segments, for instance, the lower small SUV segment they include just proportionately.</span>While we had during that period Chinese manufacturers won market share, whether that remains - the trend remains to be seen, of course.Again, when looking at this trend, please do take into account that we are in change of a phases on - in doing our model cycles successful vehicles over the last year the Santana Vista, for instance, have been discontinued, other cars are being ramped like the Vilamando [ph], which looks very promising, however, it is just in its ramp up phase currently.And the third aspect last year and we really have to put it out there very clearly, we operated at the very threshold of capacity utilization of that is still being feasible.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We’ve really maxed it out at more than - to any more than 300 working days a year.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So we simply have no more headroom for the flexibility to react to seasonal fluctuations adequately to undertake preparations for new models without losing capacity that sort of thing, so everything taking together lead to the effect in the first two months.</span>[Interpreted] In China, please consider that for years we’ve kind of again been talking about the following.We have an increasing situation coming above the market now the prices are gradually deteriorating.And this concerns almost the whole market, this is nothing near to us and you.This is what we expect to continue with our brands.We are holding on.We are still very sound and on a sound basis and continuing on that.How this will continue from here, as we take it from here depends very much on the competitive situation, of course, things have moved during the first two months, and we’ll keep a very close eye on how things are developing, of course.I have a comment on the equity ratio.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I can be brief round about 26% of the group, please take into account that we have one of the biggest banks in Europe on board financial services with €130 billion balance sheet total and, of course, with a much lower equity equipment needed in the banking system.</span>We have 36% for - many mechanical engineers and machine builders would be happy if they had this sort of level of equity ratio where this come from.We purchased Scania shares in the group and, of course, the pension accruals of results as reported earlier, there are no reflections at the moment to launch any capital increasing measures.Charles, please?Good afternoon.This is Charles Winston from Redburn, just two from me.Firstly, Porsche, it looks though we had a strong recovery in revenues in the fourth quarter and the margin, as you predicted did recover from the low point in the third quarter.Could you perhaps give us some sort of insight as to the pace of growth from Porsche going from here, in other words, perhaps, what sort of order book you’ve got in the Macan and - because I think looking at the numbers, it was about 27% revenue growth in the fourth quarter.How long can that sort of pace of growth continue as we go into 2015?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And could you also perhaps confirm about a little dip in the margin we saw in Porsche in the third quarter, which seems to have recovered, we’re not - we’re going to see no more dips like that in 2015 or is that - was that going to be perhaps another one?</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then just very clearly to Mr. Pötsch, in an earlier question, you’ve talked about the fact there hadn’t been any significant changes in the provisioning.</span>My understanding is the labor bonuses that were taken in operating provisions and now taken in payables, so there has been some change in provisioning, maybe wrong, just perhaps if you could confirm that, because you early on suggested there hadn’t been any change?Thanks a lot.[Interpreted] Well, first, let me answer the Porsche question.2014 was characterized first of all by the ramp up of the Macan.And then as you mentioned rightly, the ramp up situation for the facelift for the Cayenne, we update you.We are very satisfied with the way things developed in 2014.When it comes to your question on 2015, we assume that there will be a moderate cautious development, which was mentioned several times today.The market volatility are a matter of concern for the Porsche brand as well.We will counter that by offering a very attractive product range.And as you can see when looking at China, we have a very effective and powerful high quality dealership network.And we consequently assume that this year we will achieve the values that we achieved in 2014.I can’t give you or I don’t prefer not to give you a concrete figure, but we are confident about the rest of the year.And your assessment on the bonus obligations is correct that we have had a reallocation of provisions into short-term liabilities.[Interpreted] All right.Thank you very much.Unfortunately, as time is snapping at our heels, I have to wrap up here.Thank you for putting so many questions to us and thank you to the board and this answers will be available to take any other questions bilaterally, please don’t hesitate to approach us.Thank you for coming and joining us, and have a safe trip to home.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an
