/ Let the call go forth across the land: Bunga bunga parties —even those involving underage women you may or may not have paid to have sex with—are for once and all time legal in Italy .<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And just in the nick of time, for the great Silvio just happens to have come into some more free time, having completed his community service for tax fraud just last week.</span>The Court of Cassation rejected prosecutors� appeal and confirmed Berlusconi�s acquittal on charges he paid for sex with an underage prostitute during raunchy, sex-fueled �bunga bunga� parties at his Milan villa, and used his influence to cover it up.Of course, Silvio’s not exactly completely free to get his 78-year-old freak on just yet.For while the high court signed off on bunga bunga and politely asking the police to spare his young lady-friend the indignity of a shoplifting charge, it remains to be seen just how much of a cover-up Italian courts will stand.Probably a lot of cover-up.Despite Tuesday�s high court victory, Berlusconi�s legal woes aren�t over: Milan prosecutors are also investigating him for allegedly paying off witnesses in the �bunga-bunga� case, and he�s still on trial in Naples for alleged political corruption.UBS Employees Slated To Attend Networking Party For �The Sexual Elite� This Weekend: Report Bill Ackman’s Protégé Is All Grown Up Hedge Fund
