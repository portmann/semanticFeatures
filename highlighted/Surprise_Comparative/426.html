(NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha AT&T is cheaply priced based on telecom peers, utility class, historical yield spreads, and free cash flow yield.The bearish argument that AT&T is effectively a "utility stock" is irrelevant in terms of valuation.Even if interest rates spike in 2015, AT&T's stock price will likely barely suffer due to record high pre-existing spreads (i.e., already priced in).Although competition is increasing, large capex costs will eat into further domestic mobile encroachment.I own AT&T (NYSE: T ) shares in two of my conservative blue-chip focused portfolios and often recommend the shares as a key component of a buy-and-hold portfolio.However, one of the most commonly touted bearish arguments is that T is a 'bond-proxy' stock, similar to most other utility companies.Recent actions by the FCC to support net neutrality (i.e., regulation) have further cemented this argument.T and peer Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) are no longer viewed as tech companies, and are merely seen as utilities.AT&T's recent "dismissal" from the Dow 30 in exchange for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is proof of mainstream institutional views.Viewing T shares as bond proxies directly ties the forward share yield to projected Treasury rates.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With interest rates expected to climb this summer , conventional wisdom is that investors will demand a higher yield from 'utilities' such as T, thus lowering the open-market share price.</span>I believe that viewing AT&T as a utility is a short-sighted mistake and that a blended view is more appropriate, but I also believe that even with AT&T as a bond-proxy, the rate increase is already fully baked in.Historical data suggests that even if 10-year Treasury yields skyrocket by 100 basis points (far beyond any mainstream 2015 projections), AT&T's yield remains very attractive and actually has room to decrease.I back-tested AT&T and the 10-year Treasury yield to 1994 and adjusted share-price and forward dividend payouts for the 1998 stock split.The below chart shows the high point of each price and yield during the month of March to provide a seasonal comp.The results demonstrate that T is trading at its highest spread to T-Notes in recent history.The last three times T-notes saw a rapid rate spike was 2013 to 2014, 2009 to 2010, and 2004 to 2005.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>All three times T's yield increased, but at a much smaller proportion (roughly 50%).</span>This time T is trading only 89 yield basis points below its 20-year March peak (2010), while T notes are trading 519 yield basis below their 20-year March peak (1995).Said another way, the "risk premium" for T shares is at an all-time record high (inclusive of T's full public history).<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The only true comparison to AT&T is Verizon; however, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ), and Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR ) provide a wider field.</span>I will highlight 4-year average free cash flow yield (FCF%) and current dividend yield.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I believe the former is most important to value investors while the latter serves as a clearer indication of market sentiment.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Obviously, a company with a much larger FCF yield versus dividend yield has much more potential to boost the latter, and ultimately the share price, as long as capital expenditures have been sufficient.</span>For the sake of the "utility" argument, I've included a field of 5 "leading" (by market cap) utilities.Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK ), NextEra (NYSE: NEE ), Dominion Resources (NYSE: D ), Southern Co. (NYSE: SO ), and Exelon (NYSE: EXC ).Both of these charts hammer home that T is trading cheap, but the most shocking factor is that "downgrading" AT&T to utility status should actually raise its relative premium.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Note the tiny FCF yields on utilities are likely due to strong capex cycles, while the higher market cap is likely due to both yield-seeking and cheap energy projections.</span>While T trades far below its historical average yield, most utilities do not.The "utility" and bond-proxy arguments have been addressed, but two key issues remain - enormous upcoming capex and spectrum costs to maintain market share and increasing domestic mobile competition.I believe the capex and spectrum costs are part of the utility argument, but I do see domestic mobile competition as a serious factor to consider.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With SOFTBANK's ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) purchase of Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile US on the apparent warpath , the US competitive landscape is shifting towards lower returns.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In Korea, Japan, and many smaller European countries, mobile services are nowhere near as profitable as in the US, primarily due to smaller barriers to entry and less land to cover.</span>The required capex and spectrum costs that bears tout for AT&T is the same factor that ultimately should continue to keep a fairly profitable environment.The largest threat to these carriers is the movement towards mobile calls over Wi-Fi, which could sap some customers from urban regions.AT&T trades cheaply compared to two sets of peers, and also trades for a record risk-premium to 10-year Treasuries, due to a multitude of bearish sentiments.Many of these bearish ideas are legitimate concerns on their own, but are incompatible with each other (i.e., huge capex and increasing competition or interest rate risk vs. current and comparative yields).While T certainly has risks going forward, I personally would be more concerned as an owner of Comcast or Time Warner as lucrative content deals may begin slipping away and consumers will focus on internet-provided entertainment instead.With new spectrum and tower upgrades, mobile internet might become more mainstream, which should actually be tailwinds for AT&T and Verizon.I am hesitant to label T as "screaming cheap" despite its historical yield and industry comparables, as I believe Comcast and Time Warner trade irrationally expensive.I typically value my blue chip stocks on free cash flow yields compared to the S&P 500 earnings multiples.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the current market, I look for 10-15x (yield of 7%-10%) on slow growers and energy companies and 15-20x (5%-7% yield) on more moderate stalwarts such as McDonald's ( MCD ) and Wal-Mart ( WMT ).</span>This results in my personal "fair valuation range" for AT&T of $28-$42 with a midpoint of $35.Note that this is my personal "buying range" and where I recommend T in a portfolio.I wouldn't necessarily sell at $42, but you won't find me writing any bullish coverage.Source: AT&T: Cheaply Priced Despite Interest Rate Risk Disclosure: The author is long T, VZ.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
