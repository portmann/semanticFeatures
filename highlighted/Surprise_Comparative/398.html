in 2014.Our CFO, Andrew Johannesen will then provide you with a more detailed review of our financial results.Finally, I'll provide some comments regarding 2015 and then we'll take your questions.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We continue to make progress towards our strategic objectives by becoming a more balanced and stronger nutrition company.</span>We've been taking steps to increase growth opportunities, reduce capital intensity and increase the diversity of inputs in end markets.In 2014, we moved towards these objectives with the acquisition of Bioriginal Food & Science in September.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This was our largest acquisition to date and provides us with a broader product portfolio, especially oils and essential fatty acids, more private label and finished good opportunities and a less capital intensive operation.</span>We also successfully consolidated our gold fishing operations and began a project to increase the run rate at our lowest cost fish processing plant.For the year, we reported earnings of $0.85 per diluted share on $309 million of revenue.Adjusting for the Cameron closure costs and nonrecurring charges associated with the Bioriginal acquisition, we generated $70 million of adjusted EBITDA and $1.37 of adjusted earnings per share.Our animal nutrition business, which consist of sales of fish meal and fish oil performed very well in 2014.The aquaculture industry remains our largest customer base for this segment accounting for over half of our 2014 sales.The pet food industry followed at 22% and the swine industry at 14%.Global supply and demand dynamics continue to give us opportunities to contract historically high prices during the year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The biggest factor driving prices last year was lower global supply, particularly from South America.</span>Cost to produce these products are determined by the success of our fishing operation.In 2014, we produced 138,000 tons of product a 27% decrease from the previous year.Although yields contributed to 2014's production decline, we expected a decrease as a result of our strategic decision to consolidate fishing operations in the Gulf, which resulted in the removal of three vessels from our fishing fleet and closure of Cameron Louisiana facility.Our Human Nutrition segment, which consists primary of sales to food and supplement manufactures and retailers made good progress during the year.Acquiring Bioriginal in September was an important strategic step that also contributed $36 million of sales in the four months we owned it.We grew sales of Manhattan based Omega-3s by 9% in a year that the Omega-3 category contracted and we completed a capital project at our dairy protein production facility that creates new opportunities for our business.However 2014 was not without challenges in the Human Nutrition segment.While we continued to make progress, we remain optimistic about our human nutrition businesses.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This segment has taken longer to gain attraction than we had hoped and has posted lower sales and margins than we had expected.</span>As a result we've taken a $4.7 million non-cash write down related to our fish oil concentration and other nutraceutical businesses.These businesses are important components of our future success and they became even more strategic to us following the Bioriginal acquisition due to their potential to add values to plant and marine based oils.We see the early stages of a more balanced diversified business model by analyzing our revenues.From 2012 to 2014, revenues increased from $236 million to $309 million.Fish meal as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 68% to 48%, while sales to food and supplement manufactures and retailers grew from 9% to 21%.Finally sales of products derived from Manhattan decreased from 91% in 2012 to 80% in 2014.For the full year Bioriginal, we expect these trends of increasingly balanced and diversified revenues to continue in 2015.While the revenue analysis illustrates our increased diversification in growth, we realize these changes must make their way down the income statement.This will be the major focus in 2015 as we work to better integrate our human nutrition acquisitions and capitalize our synergies within our company.We're taking a number of steps to accomplish this.The Bioriginal acquisition expanded our sales force and we're working to integrate our sales efforts and cross-sell products in 2015 while staying focused on ways to make our customers more successful.On the operations side, we've recruited a number of key employees into our dairy protein business including new plant and supply chain managers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We've also integrated our operation teams to better leverage operational expertise and innovation across the business and our operations team is working closely with our sales team to identify opportunities to drive additional volumes through our oil concentration and dairy protein facilities.</span>Overall, 2014 was a good year from Omega Protein both in terms of financial results and the progress towards achieving our strategic objectives.As discussed, we acknowledge there were areas where we did not make as much progress as anticipated, but we believe we're taking the steps necessary to maximize shareholder value.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With that business overview, I would now like to turn the call over to our Executive Vice President and CFO, Andrew Johannesen to discuss our financial results in more detail.</span>Thank you, Bret, and good morning everyone.I will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, followed by some balance sheet highlights and thoughts on 2015.Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $102 million, up from $66 million in the same period a year ago.This reflects a $12 million volume-driven increase in animal nutrition segment revenues as fish oil sales volumes were up 34% and fish meal volumes rose 17%.Prices were not a significant driver as the 3% increase in fish meal prices was largely offset by a 9% decline in fish oil prices.We also benefited from our first full quarter with Bioriginal, which drove a $25 million increase in human nutrition segment revenues.Consolidated gross profit for the fourth quarter was $23 million compared to $28 million in the same period last year.Gross profit as a percentage of revenues or gross margin was 22% in the fourth quarter, down from 42.4% a year ago and up from 28% in the third quarter of 2014.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the Animal Nutrition segment, gross margin fell from 47.1% a year ago to 28.7%, reflecting higher unit cost for currencies and production.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>These higher unit cost reflect two key factors.</span>First, there was a 10% decrease in total yields, which all else being equal increases unit cost by about 10%.Second, the unit cost true-up related to prior period sales decreased from an unusually large $4.4 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $400,000 benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, whereas not for the cost true-up benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, gross margin would have been 28.1%.Average unit revenues were nearly identical in the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014.In the Human Nutrition segment, we had a gross margin of 8.6% in the fourth quarter a decrease from 13.6% a year ago and an increase from the gross loss of 0.1% in the third quarter of 2014.Compared to the same period a year ago, the decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by protein products where ingredient sales volumes dropped due to market over supply, fixed cost increased as a result of a recent plant expansion and capacity utilization was hampered by limited raw material supply.Selling general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $2.8 million to $8.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 due largely to the addition of Bioriginal expenses.As Bret noted, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a $4.7 million impairment related to our fish oil concentration and other nutraceutical businesses.We also recorded a $1.6 million charge related to the closure of our Cameron plant.Net income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.7 million or $0.45 per deluded share for the same period last year.After excluding plant closure charges, impairment expenses, acquisition related costs and net gain or loss on disposal of assets, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $7.8 million a $0.35 per deluded share compared to $14 million or $0.67 per deluded share a year ago.Adjusted EBITDA totaled $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, down from $27 million in the same period a year ago.Looking at results for the full year, revenues increased from $244 million last year to $309 million.Gross profit declined from $83 million to $78 million and gross margin declined from 33.9% to 25.1%.The gross margin declines reflected declines in both segments.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the Animal Nutrition segment, a modest increase in average revenue per ton from $1,355 last year to $1,390 in 2014 was more than offset by an increase in average cost per ton from $867 to $976.</span>Net income for the year was $18 million or $0.85 per diluted share compared to $31 million or $1.45 per diluted share in 2013.After the previously mentioned exclusions, adjusted net income for 2014 was $30 million or $1.37 per diluted share, compared to $36 million or $1.70 per diluted share in 2013.Adjusted EBITDA for 2014 was $70 million, which in Omega's history is second only to the $77 million recorded in 2013.Let me now turn to our balance sheet.Cash balances decreased from $34 million a year ago to $1 million on December 31, 2014, due in large part to investments in the Bioriginal acquisition and capital expenditures.Total debt increased $11 million to $35 million during the year although it declined $20 million during the fourth quarter.With $65 million available under our corporate credit facility, we believe we have ample liquidity to operate and prudently invest in our business.Stockholder's equity increased by $19 million to $266 million and our book value per share increased to $12.35.Our balance sheet remains strong and we believe it will continue to provide the financial flexibility needed to create shareholder value.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Looking ahead to 2015, in our Animal Nutrition segment, we entered the year with approximately 50,000 tons of product and inventory, which is meaningfully less than the elevated level we carried into 2014.</span>We expect to sell this inventory in the first half of 2015 and in recent years have sold at least 40% of the carryover volumes in the first quarter.As of December 31, we've sold forward approximately 54,000 short tons of fish meal and 14,000 metric tons of fish oil for anticipated 2015 delivery at average prices slightly above those realized in 2014.We expect these forward contracts to comprise the bulk of sales in the first half of 2015 and to drive segment margins in line slightly above those realized in the second half of 2014.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>At this time, we have much less visibility into the second half of 2015.</span>Prices will be determined by future market conditions and volumes and unit cost will be heavily influenced by 2015 fish catching yields.To provide some context on production, 2014 yields were close to normal coming in at 2% below the five year average.2014 fish catch was adversely impacted by a slow start in the Gulf.More typical fishing in the early season would likely have added roughly 10,000 tons to our 138,000 tons of total 2014 production.As for the Human Nutrition segment, we hope to improve upon 2014's fourth quarter results to growth in both revenues and gross margins.We expect segment performance to be highly influenced by sales and supply volumes, capacity utilization at our manufacturing facilities, product prices and raw material cost.Thanks, Andrew.Before turning to your questions, I would like to make a few comments about events in 2015 that we want to bring your attention.We plan to start our 2015 Gulf fishing season on April 20 and our Atlantic season in mid May.We'll be monitoring two developments during the year that could impact our 2015 production.First, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission or ASMFC could adjust our Atlantic quota.The Commission released its 2014 Atlantic Manhattan stock assessment earlier this year and the report concluded the population was not over fished nor is over fishing occurring.We're hopeful that this new assessment will show fishery managers that the increase in the harvest quota on the East Coast can be accomplished sustainably.A decision is not expected in May at the very earliest and we will continue to update you in coming quarters as new information is available.Second, based on our court decision, the Department of Labor and U.S. Customs and Immigration Services had temporarily suspended processing of H2B visa applications.We've traditionally utilized the program to staff many of our Gulf fishing vessels, so the recent development has created some uncertainty around staffing.We'll also be monitoring fishing quota announcements this spring to get initial read on the global supply of fish meal and fish oil.Although published prices for these ingredients remain near historically high prices, few of our customers have been willing to enter into forward contracts at these levels.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Quota announcements this spring are expected to give the industry a better feel for the global supply picture and the 2015 pricing outlook.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Finally, we'll focus on deeper customer relationships, a stronger supply chain and better integration within our Human Nutrition segment in 2015, which should help address one of our most pressing challenges, excess capacity at our processing plants.</span>In the short term, we expect some degree of quarter-over-quarter margin volatility as the business continues to develop.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However over the longer term, we are optimistic about our growth prospects and expect margins to improve as revenues increase with the full integration of Bioriginal, coupled with increased capacity utilization at our manufacturing facilities.</span>Our overall goal for 2015 remains the same as it was in 2014.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We want to take steps towards achieving our strategic objectives by becoming a more balanced and stronger nutrition company.</span>These include increasing growth opportunities, improving margins, reducing capital intensity and increasing the diversity of inputs in end markets.That concludes our prepared remarks for the day.On behalf of Andrew, John and I, we’d like to thank everyone for their interest in Omega Protein.The three of us along with other members of our Management team are now available to take your questions.Operator?Thank you.We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions] Thank you.Our first question is coming from the line of Mitch Pinheiro with Imperial Capital.Please go ahead with your question.Thanks for the additional color on the call.I appreciate that stuff.So first I just -- if I missed it I’m sorry, but did you talk about what the volume sold was in the fourth quarter?Mitch yes, we talked about the volumes compared to where they’ve been in the prior periods.So they were up -- oil and meal were up 34% and 17% from a year ago and 31% and 6% from the third quarter.Okay.I’m just trying to get a feel for the gross profit per ton that's all.So any color around that or the cost per ton in the quarter?Well the cost per ton is 1,390 for the year and I would say it’s been relatively stable in the last few quarters.So not too far, not too far from there it’s ticked up a little bit.So little bit north of that.Okay.Then a question -- what does the so you talked about the Department of Labor and suspending the Visa hurting your staffing, what does that mean?So should we be expecting wage cost up and how meaningful is that as part of the cost structure?Yes in terms of the H2B, it will depend ultimately how that impacts us.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>There is the potential for some higher wage cost due to ultimate sources of labor.</span>It could be some decrease in our productivity if there is some shortage of labor.So it will depend how that plays out.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And Mitch just to follow-on on that, the Visa program is typically utilized to get experienced fishermen and so it's less, as Andrew mentioned, if we need to go out and get people put pressure, the cost structure, but typically we utilize that program because of the experience of the workers we get rather than them receiving a wage is different than someone else.</span>Got you, got you.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Then does -- just trying to get a feel for the Bioriginal integration, what exactly -- could you give a little more color on the plans to integrate Bioriginal and any help on determining what or how accretive Bioriginal be in 2015?</span>Sure, Bioriginal did a couple of things for us.One, it brought a team that had really good customer relationships, great knowledge of how specialty oils and essential fatty acids work in the body.They also had packaging assets, which is something that the company did not have many packaging assets before.We had manufacturing facilities but a lot of the products that we're producing were more bulk rather than retail ready packaging.And so when we look at what Bioriginal then will do as part of the Human Nutrition segment and how it will play in, I think -- first if you look at the biggest challenge we have right now, which is excess capacity at our facilities, having a team additional team members that can help not only drive products that we're currently sending through those facilities.But trying to find ways to take other products that were in Bioriginal's portfolio and see if we can send them to these facilities that would be one of the things that they can do.Secondly, as we look at our business model and look to take it from being just a pure ingredient provider to providing more private label opportunities, finished goods, opportunities with customers, I think that that fits in quite well with how the existing operations are set out.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then finally, I would just say if you look at the customer base that Bioriginal had and you look at the customer base that we had on the human side before the acquisition of Bioriginal, they were fairly complementary and as a result, the decent amount of work this year just making sure that the entire sales teams are working together to talk about opportunities that are out there to sell more products to each customer and make sure there are not gaps in the market.</span>So those are the kind of three way I see the integration going this year.I'll turn it over to Andrew to address the second part of your question.Yes Mitch as you think about accretion, the way I would frame that is if you look at what Bioriginal did for us, the four months that we own them, in 2014 they had total revenues of $36 million.I think that gives you a sense of what the current run rate is there.We had said at the time of the acquisition that they had previously been running with operating margins around 6.5%, that's still by a reasonable assumption subject to a few adjustments, the biggest of which would be from a GAAP perspective we have to run the deferred deal consideration through the P&L and so that will hit from a GAAP perspective, but we adjust that out in our adjusted numbers that was $600,000 in the fourth quarter and there was some depreciation write up as well.Okay.That's very helpful and just to follow-up on Bret what you had said as far as the excess capacity, what percentage of Bioriginal is being manufactured, outsourced by COPAC that has the potential to come and be brought into your facility or is there other opportunities like vice versa having some of your stuff manufactured in Bioriginal?Sure.Bioriginal uses quite a few -- in terms of manufacturing process there are several parts of the chain where they do utilize others.They do some of the processing themselves, but for instance they maybe buying a refined oil and doing something with the once they get it and we’re currently going through and figuring out all the different ways that our assets can be utilized.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It's difficult to say right now, there is definitely some opportunities that are out there, I wouldn’t say based on what we have today that there is a huge number based on the current sales, but there are a number of different opportunities that they see that, they had oil concentration facilities, they might be able to bring the market now that they don’t or there are some opportunities to potentially expand the market for what they’re doing/ If they can get a little bit lower cost and we’re going through that process and understanding if we can be more competitive by utilizing some of our current assets to do that.</span>Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research.Please proceed with your questions.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Just wondering, I don’t think you commented on the energy input picture, but certainly that is a big input, can you talk though how do you see your existing hedge positions impacting the margin in 2015 and to what extent the lower catch cost will flow through into the P&L.</span>Sure Tim, this is Andrew.You’re absolutely right energy and fuel is a significant part of the cost structure particularly for the fishing operations.It’s one of the largest expenses after labor in that business and typically makes up roughly 10% to 15% of fishing operation cost.We hedge a portion of that really with a goal of reducing our exposure to volatility and fuel pricing from one year to the next.For 2015, we’ve hedged probably about half of our anticipated fuel needs for the year those were hedged in the kind of fall timeframe generally, but over a period of time.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But if prices that I would describe as being closer to what we experienced in '14 and where the current energy curves are, so a slight improvement over '14 on those hedge positions, but with the remainder of remaining open.</span>For 2016, we’ve done some hedging as well, but not as much I’d say roughly a third of expected usage in '16 and '17 and beyond there are no hedges in place.So if energy prices stay where there are today for an indefinite period of time, we’d expect to see some benefit in '15 little more benefit in '16 and then full benefit in '17 and after.And the benefit in '15, roughly take the delta in '15 over '14 cash cost and multiply that by 0.5 and multiply that by your 10% to 15% and that's sort of where we're at, am I thinking about that correctly?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I think so yeah, 10% to 15% of total cost and about half of that at levels a little lower than last year and a half reflecting what we’ll see in the market, neither at the time or if we do some incremental hedging in the mean time, I think those are the key components.</span>And obviously there is a lot of assumptions in there in terms of normal fishing and production levels, but if you take that all into account, I think that’s the right way to think about it.Sure and Bret I think you said in your prepared remarks that the focus on 2015 is profitability particularly in the way processing business, how confident do you think you can -- how confident are you of delivering profitability in any way which you want to describe it for the full year?Converting your profitability in the middle of the year, but may be not summing up to profits for all of 2015, is there any outlook that you could give us that would tell us what your commitment is to profitability?Sure.You’re exactly right in that, we talked about the fact that, we’re seeing the impacts of the strategy working our way through revenues, but needed to continue to make sure that they work into the profitability of the business.We did see margins increase from third quarter to fourth quarter and in 2015, but hope that we can continue to make progress on that, being able to increase capacity utilization is not something that’s going to be able to bounce back in a single quarter, but hopefully something that we can make progress on every quarter.We talked about capacity utilization probably also helpful to talk about in terms of one plant that's additional concentration plan and then there is the way processing facility that you mentioned.From a fish, oil concentration standpoint, that's going to be primarily driving sales through that.We have the oil one of the largest fish oil, crude fish oil producers in the world and we have the refinery that you've been to and so we have the product and it's a matter of driving sales through that and trying to also figure out what types of plan based oils we can run through there and maybe a little bit of third party totaling.On the way processing facility it’s going to be continuing to build markets for the products that we sell and that’s going to be not only what we traditionally sold, which is the WPC80 product, but also some of the products that we're now able to produce like the way protein isolates and lactose and other things and so it’s going to be building up the market for that as well as strengthening the supply chain to make sure we get access to the raw material as well.Given the segments that we're in, Omega-3 is a $1 million plus category.When you talk about way protein, you're talking about sports nutrition plus mill replacement, which is well above $5 million category.These are good categories that have that growth and we need to just execute on making sure that that makes us way through our facility in a profitable way.So I’d summarize by saying from a gross margin perspective, we saw a little bit of increased third quarter to fourth quarter, I would hope to continue to make some progress on that and additionally in 2015, as we take up capacity, but it’s not something that's going to bounce back in one single quarter.From operating margin perspective, would expect us to make progress there as well.I’m hesitant to catch cost too much in that segment because the CorpusPath forward in this business is I don’t think it’s one of pure cost cutting.If there is cost that we don’t need obviously, you want to rationalize those, but the opportunity here is to take assets we have that are serving very good, large growing sectors and grow into it and to do that, we need to make sure that we continue to spend money on sales and marketing and other things.Couple of question, the H2B, and so to think of it and as far as wages and increase cost of labor, how does it affect your planning as far as your fleet and the vessels you're going to put on the water usually by now [Lenovo] [ph] has their forecast out for 2015.I see that's not out as of yet.But how do you -- how are you planning and will you be more aggressive early in the season since you’ve been kind of behind the eighth ball last couple of seasons on a slow start to your fishing?Sure.Regarding the H2B Visa program, that is as a program that we do utilize in most years, but we have there were probably 2008 and 2009, we did not have the Visa program and probably some other used before that and we can operate without it.It does -- there is no doubt that having access to the experience fishermen that have worked in the boats in the past, help manage the vessels and I think the kind of the impact of that will depend on how long this delay last.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And by that I mean is fishing typically starts a little slower and even if we had all the vessels day one versus a month later, it may not make as big of an impact as if you don’t have all the vessels crude in July.</span>And so, one of the things that we'll trying to figure out is this situation, how temporary is the slowdown in processing -- the moratorium on processing the applications and is it going to impact us in the heart of the season or not.In the meantime, we’ll also be going through and looking at other opportunities to mend some of the vessels that we may not have identified today.This is also something that is a Gulf situation only.It’s not a situation that impacts us on the East Coast.As far as the same part of your question about will we be more aggressive early in the season.In the Gulf, we will -- last year we were very aggressive at the start of the season and Mother Nature just wasn’t able to cooperate with us to give us the quick start we wanted.I think I don’t see any change in what we’re going to do in the Gulf as far as being more aggressive.I think where we -- you’re going to see us be a little more aggressive on the East Coast.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In the past as I think you know, we’ve pushed the season back a little bit to try to maximize catching fish when we thought the yield was a little bit higher and so we started -- or we typically started in mid-May last couple of years over the last two years, we delayed it a little bit in order to maximize the yield.</span>But this year we're going to go ahead and start May 11, which is the first day we canned fish and we’ll go at a very hard instead of doing cases now we get extra quota later in the year, we’ll have the fish in the bank to be able to do that.In regards to the quota of the -- we have the May meeting with the Atlantic Management Committee they also have a August meeting, science is on your side the politics is in question.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Would you anticipate that if you do get more volumes and may kind of be that rollover effect we’re seeing last two years and the greater quota is more likely to be seen in 2016 in case they don’t make a decision in the May meeting?</span>It is very difficult to obviously predict what’s going to happen.We’re very happy with the science that has come out and we’re hoping that that gives everybody the comfort to do that.As I mentioned we’re going to fish hard to start the season, we have another vessel that is ready to go if we get some additional quota.But as far as the strategy that they would take if they in fact do increase the quotas is not known at this time.I think there’s the potential that they increase it in 2015 and they give it all in 2015 is possibility they do it in '16 and obviously they don't do anything with the quota.Okay, any change in methodology as far as state allocation historically has been a five-year average or what states are harvested.There has been some rumblings that could change that between the reduction and the bait fisheries.What are you hearing and what are you seeing on that subject?For the discussions that we’ve been involved with and again that until you really get in the room and people start where you don’t really know for sure at this point, I don’t see any changes in the allocations, definitely not in 2015.And the first year that you could see any type of change would be in 2016 and there’s nothing today that we’re seeing that would be just to believe that that's going to occur, but obviously that’s always a potential.Okay.Peru is doing their reconnaissance to take a consensus on the juveniles they should have a report on that shortly.All indications are that we will get a quota in Peru that maybe similar to historical levels.Has that been factored into the pricing as we've seen it returned October levels or would you anticipate some fluctuations depending on the historical average?You’re exactly right now the timings of this and I think I had mentioned in my prepared comments that although you can pull something out of Bloomberg to see certain prices and they’ve moved around a little bit over the last few months.There’s been no volume that’s been able to be transacted and so I think the market is absolutely waiting to see what happens.I think most people are probably leaning towards the scenario that you mentioned.But I think the amount at which the global supply will be in this year still differs and so I would expect that once that quota comes out, there will be a little bit of adjustment to the pricing but not sure whether it be up or down and probably depends on the particular customer.But I think that there’s still enough disagreement about how big that quota in South America could be and then in Europe you had the [CAPLINQ quota in Iceland] [ph] which was increased as well earlier this year, which will have a little bit of an impact.So I think these will be jockeying around for a couple of months and probably by May or so probably late May early June we’ll start to really get a feel for what the year could look like.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Last topic from me, most of your animal nutrition products gone into agriculture that has a very solid compounded average growth in that industry as a whole, we’re also start to see more expansion in the North American pet food industries, new plants going up this year that’s got completed.</span>And the backlash against Chinese products have been brought here that don’t have the same oversight.Given that those are your two main areas on the animal side how does that help?We’re not seeing any increase in supply globally yet we’re going to see another tranche up on the demand markets both agriculture and both North American pet food along with your developing on the human side.Where can this go?We’ve always seen ratchet out from chicken feed to dairy, to agriculture, to pet food.Is this a pathway that should just continue as we go forward?There’s no doubt that with the agriculture industry and the pet food industry, being such large customers on that side of business that that’s a great thing and been one of the reasons why pricing has been so strong.You have soybean meal at levels that -- soybean meal at but yet fish meal stays where it’s at.It shows that the true value that both our culture and pet food industries put on fish meal which is a good thing.And so there’s -- we like our position there.We also like the vertically integrated value chain that we’ve built both for animals as well as on the human side of the business.We think more and more consumers whether they’re buying something for their children or their pets or for themselves.They’re going to be very interested in where does the product come from?Can you tell me who has been in possession of it, when, and especially when you have products that are North American dominated I think that that works extremely well.So the trends you’re talking about are trends that we see as well.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It's the reason we have gone out and invested in capacity, because we think that more and more our customers will demand to see where products are coming from and so we’ve been happy with that position in the chain.</span>And as far as working these products go, you’ve seen you've seen a steady increase in what we get for the nutrients we have from a fish.One area I think is of continuing to see what happens on the human side of the business especially with the fish oil.There’s no doubt that it continues to be pharmaceutical developments there, you’re seeing the naturaceutical industry do great things with Omega-3s even though it pulled back a little bit last year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And we’ll continue to look for opportunities to utilize or know-how on our manufacturing assets that get more value through those different channels.</span>So whether it’s our culture pet food, dietary supplements and see very bright future for our whole fish meal, fish oil side of the business.Most of my questions are already answered, but is there I guess any idea on what a normalized EBITDA rate is for the animal segment going forward?James, this is Andrew.The normalized EBITDA it’s going to obviously vary from year-to-year with sales volumes to reflect production volumes and margins.The way I would think about it is to -- we’ve had some good margins over the several quarters relative to history.Historically margins have typically been in the mid or upper-teens to mid-20s, so we’ve been above that recently.I think as you think about kind of normalized EBITDA for that business you can look at those margins, you can look at the recent sales and production, although this year sales volumes were elevated because of the high carryover from the prior season.But if you look at our production numbers and some of the comments I made in the prepared remarks on production and possibly some upside from there with expansion -- a little expansion in Abbeville in capacity there, but those are the factors I would think about.The G&A for animal price has changed a whole lot.Depreciation -- price doesn’t change dramatically.So that's how I think about it.But I guess for the upcoming quarter, it would be somewhat of a tough comparison from the last year right.So are you expecting EBITDA margins to be down from year ago?I think the -- well I think two things.If you're looking at -- if you're looking at the first quarter of '14 that was a very good quarter for animal from a gross margin perspective.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I think in terms of gross margins for animal, I think what we've seen in the last two quarters, the third and fourth quarter of '14 are probably better indicators of what we would expect to see first half of next year, although as I said in the comments maybe some room for some improvement there with better pricing, but not necessarily up to the level we saw in early '14.</span>From a -- so if you think about that from a -- just from a pure margin perspective, from a volume perspective, the first part of '14 will be a difficult comp if you will because of the large inventory carryover that we had coming into '14, which was unusually large.As you may recall, late '13 we had a very strong fourth quarter fish catch, which is pretty unusual that led us to carry a lot of product over into '14, which we sold in the first half of that year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Heading into '15, we have a more I think normalized set of conditions in that.</span>If you look at the inventory, as I said roughly 50,000 tons coming into the year relative to production for the year of 138,000 tons, that's probably a more normal relationship and so nothing abnormal, but not the unusually strong conditions we had coming into the first half of '14.Well just on behalf of the management
