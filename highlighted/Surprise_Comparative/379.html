when will the ECB become satisfied with price stability?Will the ECB focus on a specific figure such as 1.0%, or 1.5%?Or will it address a formula involving GDP growth, inflation and new loans given by banks selling ABS?The ECB should introduce a new forward guidance related to the macro metrics requiring a change in the pace of bond purchase.More specifically, the euro has nowhere to go but down as the ECB confirmed that asset purchases will extend to bonds with yields as low as -0.20%, implying that there will be sufficient enough bonds covered under the purchase program.Another hit to the New Zealand dollar NZD was dealt another overnight hit after the nation's leading dairy cooperative (and world's biggest exporter of dairy products) Fonterra received threats to contaminate baby formula if the government did not refrain from using pesticide 1080 in controlling wild animals.A letter received by Fonterra threatened to contaminate infants and other formula with 1080 pesticide.The New Zealand dairy industry sustained a major botulism scare in 2013, prompting global recall of Fonterra products and an import ban by China NZ's biggest buyer of New Zealand dairy exports.The scare was eventually unsubstantiated but did shake up NZ's image as the leader of clean and high quality milk.Last week, the kiwi dropped across the board on an announcement by the RBNZ exploring ways to cap property lending, which was interpreted by traders as a means to allow an impending rate cut.The fact these two negative events occurred days apart ahead of this week's RBNZ interest rate announcement, raises speculation that the central bank may be ready to make its strongest signal towards slashing rates.NZ's overheating property sector stands as the main obstacle to a rate cut, which the RBNZ would welcome as a means of depreciating the currency.RBNZ chief Wheeler's repetitive attempts to talk down the currency have proven to be a big failure due to the currency's status as the highest yielder with overnight rate at 3.50%.But if the RBNZ sheds more detail on its plan for macroprudential measures towards property, then the currency could take another swift hit this Wednesday, without the help of a rate cut.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
