Bush signed the Economic Stabilization Act , which set the process leading to the "stress tests" in motion.Most banks are having no problem with this year's tests, which evaluate how bank capital can handle economic volatility.Capital One (NYSE: COF ) raised its dividend 33% after passing the test.Citicorp (NYSE: C ) passed the test and announced a dividend.Regions Financial (NYSE: RF ) raised its dividend 20% after passing the test.Not all banks have done so well.Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) was told it has to re-submit before it can raise its dividends.Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB ) and Bank Santander (NYSE: SAN ) failed.Deposit insurance is a form of government protection, and for that protection government has a right to look at the books, just as any private party offering similar protection would have a right to look at the books.When those examinations were incomplete, as they were in the last decade, huge banks like Bank of America required government bailouts to survive.Without such bailouts we would almost certainly have revisited the Great Depression's horrors.Learning from history is not a bad thing.It's true that, since the stress tests first came into force in 2010, regional banks have for the most part been outperforming money center banks.Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), a money center bank whose policies are more like those of a regional, has been the star of the banking show, its stock nearly doubling in that time.Companies that combine pool risky trading ventures with deposit activity, on a massive scale, like Bank of America and Citicorp, have not done so well.One would think that the lesson by now is clear.Don't take the depositors' money to the dog track.Don't put the government's guarantee at risk.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) CEO Lloyd Blankfein acknowledges that there's no longer such a thing as "pure capitalism," and that western banking systems are regulated.</span>He is right.After the 1913 creation of the Federal Reserve, the Great Depression, and the Great Recession, the message of regulation has finally sunk in, but its necessity has not.Here is my bottom line.The CCAR process is working, and I wouldn't touch a bank stock that can't pass it anymore.Source: Big Banks Are Not Nationalized If They Can't Crash Disclosure: The author is long WFC.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.</span>The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.</span>We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To learn more about it, click here.</span>If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
