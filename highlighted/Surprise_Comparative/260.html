guaranteed to rise in June; if the increase is delayed, dividend funds will rally.The purpose of this article is to evaluate the attractiveness of the SPDR Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA: SDY ) as an investment option.To do so, I will evaluate recent market performance, the unique characteristics of the ETF, and trends in the industries that make-up SDY in an attempt to determine where the fund may be headed from here.First, a little about SDY.This has been a very popular ETF for the past several years, as it seeks to closely match the returns and characteristics of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.This Index is designed to measure the performance of the highest dividend-yielding companies in the S&P Composite 1500 Index that have followed a policy of consistently increasing dividends every year for at least 20 consecutive years.At the time of writing, SDY is trading at $76.99 and pays a quarterly dividend which yields 2.29%, according to the State Street (NYSE: STT ) website.Over the past 52 weeks, SDY has gained just over 5%, which just about matches the rise of roughly 7.5% of the Dow Jones Index over the same time period, once dividends are accounted for.However, year to date, SDY has sharply underperformed the Dow, dropping 2.3% versus the drop of .9% in the Dow.However, I feel that SDY's recent underperformance represents a great buying opportunity for long-term investors, as I will outline below.First, SDY, along with many other dividend-paying funds, is dropping disproportionately because of a fear that interest rates are set to rise.In fact, Tuesday's market drop is being attributed almost exclusively to this fear, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, who said "the strengthening dollar and signs that the Federal Reserve is preparing to raise rates, for the first time since the recession, had rattled investors."Investors are concerned about rising rates because it could prompt a slowdown in the U.S. economy and, particularly relevant to SDY, could cause a flight from dividend-paying funds as bond yields increase and investors change their preferences in favor of those bonds.However, I personally feel this risk is being overblown, which means investors who are willing to take a little short-term risk could be rewarded over the long term.First, the Federal Reserve has recently reiterated its position of being " patient " about raising rates, not wanting to curtail a tentative recovery.We will know more following its meeting next week, but for the time being nothing major has changed, rates are still at historic lows, and investors are still in a search for yield.However, it is an important risk to consider that the Fed may indeed begin to change its guidance, and rates could indeed begin to increase as soon as June.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, the increases are going to be small and incremental, meaning there is still plenty of time left to capitalize on the higher yield dividend ETFs provide other bonds.</span>Yellen herself has given guidance that rates will rise "gradually," so it would not be prudent to completely exit dividend funds in favor of bonds at the first sign on an increase.Long-term investors, such as myself, understand the importance of not following the herd, and I expect that concept to be favorable here.A second reason why I like SDY has to do with its holdings, which are made up of some of the best companies in the world.Here is a look at the top ten stocks in the fund, as of 3/9/15 : These are stable companies in mostly stable industries, which is how they are able to consistently increase their dividends year after year.But, aside from the individual companies, why I really prefer SDY right now is the top sectors it is exposed to, with financials, industrials, and consumer staples being the top three, respectively, and making up roughly 55% of the fund.The financials weighting alone is 25%, and the reason I like this is it is a perfect hedge against rising rates, which I just discussed.While it is a risk that rates will rise and investors may flee similar funds, SDY is better positioned than most to actually capitalize on these rising rates.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Banks, insurance companies, and other financial services firms actually perform better during periods of rising rates because they will typically raise the rate on the loans they charge faster than the rate they pay on deposits.</span>This increases their loan spread and, in turn, profits.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Simply put, "Higher rates improve the profitability of banks," says Christopher Lee, a money manager who specializes in financial stocks at Fidelity Investments.</span>Therefore, the risk to SDY that rates will rise will be partially offset by its sector allocation.I also mentioned that SDY is heavily weighted towards the consumer, with roughly 22% of the fund allocated to consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks.The American consumer has been coming back, with consumer spending at a record 4.2% pace in the fourth quarter of 2014, the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2006.With unemployment coming down in the U.S., I expect consumer spending to keep increasing at a robust rate, directly benefiting SDY.So far this year, the trend has been positive, and I expect that to continue throughout 2015.Of course, investing in SDY is not without risk.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The market could be headed for a much anticipated correction or interest rates could indeed rise faster than anticipated.</span>If either of those situations should occur, SDY could underperform the market if investors overreact and flee dividend-paying funds that have been in favor for so long.Additionally, SDY is only exposed to the energy sector with a 3% weighting.If oil prices rebound sharply, energy companies should rally, and SDY will miss out on the majority of that rally.However, none of these are scenarios I expect to occur and, even if they do, a long-term horizon will smooth out any of this short-term volatility.Bottom line: SDY has had a tremendous run during a sustained bull market and years of near-zero interest rates.With rates set to rise at some point this year, SDY has slipped as investors prepare for that rise.However, I do not expect rates to rise sooner than anticipated, or by a large amount.While unemployment in the U.S. is falling , wage growth recently dropped by .1% and the participation rate in the labor force is at historic lows.These are two factors that will prevent a lot of inflationary pressure, which is a key reason why the Fed will want to raise rates - to prevent inflation.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Finally, long-term investors should focus less on this short-term noise and more on the fact that SDY is made up on stocks with consistently rising dividends, and charges a fee of only .35% , much lower than comparable mutual funds.</span>With the recent drop in the market, it is a great time to initiate long positions in SDY, and I would encourage investors to take a serious look at this fund.Source: Recent Market Drop Makes SDY A Great Buy Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
