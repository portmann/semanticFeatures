Squeeze Possible After 30-Year Auction | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!Based on the current pace of earnings growth, we should see a?VERY?serious collapse in the next few months: Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!Ahead of yesterday 's stellar 10 Year auction, we remarked that the amount of shorting early in the day before most many expected would be an ugly auction, was so high it had pushed the repo rate to -1.79%, the most negative since last May.We said that this not only implies the 10Y shortage is accelerating as the entire derivatives-based world once again runs out of underlying cash securities, but that should a strong 10Y auction materialize, it would likely result in a substantial overshoot as shorts piled in to cover.Just as in fact happened.However, we did not know whether the auction would clear out the shorts.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Today we got the latest repo data from Stone McCarthy, and to our surprise we find that the shorts are still clinging on to the 10Y for dear life, hoping that if not yesterday, then today's 30 Year auction will be so ugly as to force a move wider across the entire curve.</span>From SMRA : "Even though the 10-year note auction was yesterday, the 10-year note is still trading special this morning.After the auction settlement on Monday the new on the run issue will likely trade near the GC rate."And some more color: "Pressure on the 3-year note and 30-year bond has loosened since yesterday, though both are still trading special.The 2-year and 5-year notes are both trading tight this morning.The 5-year note often starts to tighten a couple weeks before its auction announcement.None of the off the run issues are particularly tight.The off the run 30-year bond is the tightest off the run issue this morning; it is trading at 9 basis points."In other words, if today's 30 Year auction is once again stronger than all those who yesterday forecast an assured 10Y tail predict, look for more downside yield pain as not only the 30Y but the 10Y shorts are finally forced to cover.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 10:31 | 5881379 101 years and c...this simply means it is time for the government to loosen the purse strings a little and ramp up spending.maybe some fiscal stimulus so they can add about 200B more 10 yr treasuries to the list.but, someone will have to tell the fat bitch at the fed they arent allowed to buy those new bonds.Seven years ago the CBO predicted 40% debt to gdp ratios and annual GDP growth well above 3.5%.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:42 | 5881957 Unknown Poster True, but last week the 10 yr repo was positive, now less so (-1.5%).What happened 10 years ago is irrelevant.Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!03-12 13:39: Zillow's (Z) Trulia unit could lose an appeal to block ListHub... 03-12 13:39: Garmin (GRMN) has adopted rule 10B5-1 plan in a USD 300mln share... 03-12 13:39: To note for Charter (CHTR), Bright House spokesperson reports that... 03-12 13:39: XOMA Corp (XOMA) upgraded from neutral to buy at Ladenberg 03-12 13:39: NGL Energy Partners (NGL) CEO Michael Krimbill bought 20,000 shares... 03-12 13:39: Hutchison Port price their USD 500mln 3y issuance at +127.5bps and... 03-12 13:39: Banking sources say Sabadell (SAB SM) is looking to raise... 03-12 13:33: Publicis acquires omni-channel services firm Expicient 03-12 13:33: Red Hat April volatility elevated into Q4 and outlook 03-12 13:33: NYSE market internals summary 03-12 13:24: 30-Year Bonds Draw 2.681%, Allotted at High 98.37%, Bid/Cover 2.18 03-12 13:24: Stifel Shares Quiet Following Earlier Bloomberg Headline CRT May Be In Talks to Purchase Sterne Agee's Equities from Stifel, Could Pay ~$40M 03-12 13:24: Intra-Cellular Therapies Shareholder Sosland Buys 250,000 Shares @$24.00/Share -Form 4 03-12 13:24: San Francisco Judge in Trulia, ListHub Case Has Tentatively Denied Prelim.Injunction 03-12 13:24: Net Element's TOT Money Achieves Record Milestone of 1M+ Recurring Mobile Payment Subscribers 03-12 13:24: Garmin Announces Adoption of Rule 10b5-1 Plan Related to Share buyback Plan 03-12 13:24: Books on Valeant's $9.6B High Yield Bond Near $29B, According to Source -Reuters 03-12 13:24: Disney's Annual Holder Meeting Recently Getting Underway: Title of Next Star Wars Film 'Rogue One,' Co.Will Undertake Three Star Wars Films Between Present and May of '17 Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!03-12 12:09: What Americans Think Is The #1 US Problem 03-12 11:55: The Mystery Of America's Missing Wage Growth Has Been Solved 03-12 11:15: Why I Don't Want An Apple Watch (And It's Not Battery Life) 03-12 9:24: Are Alarm Bells Ringing Over Greece's Pivot To Russia?03-12 7:45: Two Police Officers Shot Outside Ferguson Police Department: Shooting Caught On Tape 03-12 9:57: Is This Why Stocks Are Soaring, And Some Context For Today's Melt-Up 03-12 8:02: Fed Will Open "Pandora's Box" With Rate Hike, UBS Warns Make sure to read our " How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters] " Guide It would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .Here's our Cookie Policy .Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!Copyright ©2009-2015 ZeroHedge.com/ABC Media, LTD;
