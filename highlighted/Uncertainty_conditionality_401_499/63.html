New Miracle Sleep Aid Discovered!My name is Jess and for most of my adult life I have been afflicted by various forms of sleeplessness.Would I call it insomnia?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I don?t know if it could be classified as clinical insomnia, but all I can say is up until a few months ago I did dread that point in the night where you turn off the light (where normal people drop off to sleep within a matter of minutes) and where, I, on the other hand, would spend many hours tossing and turning as my brain would come up with a thousand and one things to ruminate over instead of journeying peacefully to the land of nod.</span>What happened to change this dire situation you ask?I now religiously download my Freakonomics podcasts well in advance, pop my headphones on, tune in with anticipation as invariably my mind slowly melds into a soft fuzzy somnambulistic state as I listen to the dulcet tones of Stephen J. Dubner!Hidden due to low comment rating.Click here to see .Also, I don?t decide when I wake up or go to bed, my employer does.So even if my body works better, going to bed, say at 2AM and then waking up at 10AM, it doesn?t matter because the job dictates when sleep happens, at the very least when a person MUST wake up.Its not up to the individual, their biological clock or even their physician to determines when ?sleep happens?.So, can we please stop dancing around the real causes for people not getting enough sleep in America?The problem is the way we earn money, how we are employed and how ?job creators? can dictate lifestyles, PERIOD!Your employer decides who they will employ, and what working hours best support their business.You have the freedom to choose where you will apply for employment.Of course, I appreciate that it can be difficult to secure a job that aligns with all your goals, but to suggest that job creators can ?dictate? lifestyles is a poisonous suggestion in my opinion.Stop covering for them, you apologist!Are we living in different countries?I?m in the USA, where are you?You seem to have missed the changes in the employer/employee relationship in the last 20 years?There is plenty of evidence supporting this as FACT!Here are a few sample articles for you to read and brush up on, since you obviously don?t live in reality: Can employers dictate where employees live?by David Robinson, 6/28/2009 Can your company force you to be healthy?by Maya Dollarhide, 7/1/2008 Should your employer be able to dictate your health care choices?by Elizabeth Hayes, 7/3/2014 Lawmakers Pass Bill Allowing Some Employers To Dictate Religious Beliefs And Behavior, by David Badash, 2/5/5 Hidden due to low comment rating.Click here to see .In fact, most employers believe they can ?wish away? visible illnesses in their employees.Here is another article for you to ponder, since you insist that employers don?t “dictate lifestyles??: Subway Forces Violently Sick Employee to Keep Working, Then Fires Her, by C.A. Pinkham, 7/16/14 A Freeport, Texas Subway employee so ill she had to be rushed to the hospital was forced to keep working by her manager — then the restaurant fired her when someone else called an ambulance.Elizabeth Taft apparently had a stomach virus so severe that she was ?going back and forth to the bathroom? and was ?drenched in sweat? during her shift at Subway, reports Click2Houston.When she approached her manager about the fact that she was so ill she could barely function and was likely to make customers sick, the woman quite reasonably* replied ?I don?t care.Get back on the line.The manager also told her to ?just switch shirts? to hide the vomit stains.When Taft finally got a chance to take a break, she went outside and more or less passed out on the lawn, whereupon an employee at the Pizza Hut next door found her and called an ambulance.After being taken to the hospital, Taft was fired — her bosses claim for ?poor performance and insubordination?.There are pictures of Taft nearly passed-out on the lawn (taken by the Pizza Hut employee and posted to social media), and we know for a fact she was sick since she has the hospital trip and a doctor?s note to prove it.There?s no getting around this on the restaurant?s part by claiming it was a hoax, so obviously they have to try to discredit Taft, proving the adage that if corporations are people, they are sociopaths.I know a lot of commenters who have no experience in the industry are going to immediately say, ?why did she come in?It?s her fault for working sick!There is no such thing as paid sick leave for food service workers, so if you want to be able to pay the rent, you have to work through whatever illness you?re dealing with.That might seem reasonable to you, but there?s another side to that same coin — there are places where any call-out, even without a prior history, will result in your immediate termination.Such was the case here: when Taft was asked by Click2Houston why she didn?t make the decision to go home, her answer was ?because I knew if I left work I?d have lost my job.Restaurants and other businesses are technically allowed to fire workers for missing time due to medical issues in most districts due to unbelievably shoddy legal protections for sick workers.** My very first serving job (Plato?s Diner in College Park, MD, for those who are curious) was like that: you were literally not allowed to call out of work for any reason, ever.That was their official stated policy, and it was not considered a labor violation.It didn?t matter how likely you were to spread your illness to your customers — you had to show up, come hell or high water.Some jobs won?t even let you get a co-worker to work for you if you?re sick, at least if your manager is a power-mad lunatic like one Blockbuster manager I worked for — and workers have absolutely no recourse.Every health department in America is adamant about the fact that sick workers should not be handling food.That?s basic common sense; as Taft points out, even though she was wearing gloves, ?it?s a public health issue.But until that policy is enforced in such a way as to prevent worker abuse, its existence isn?t going to matter.This is what happens when we pretend food service workers are sub-human and essentially refuse to regulate the industry?s labor practices (and don?t enforce what regulations do exist).This is what happens when there aren?t laws in place to stop clear abuses by sociopathically callous managers.This is the prison our ?wealth = worth? philosophy has built for us; abuses like this are allowed to happen because we don?t consider the working poor and middle class worthy of legal protection or basic human decency.While there?s plenty of talk about raising the minimum wage (and there should be), we should probably also spare some attention for laws that prevent abuses like this from happening.** If you don?t have a doctor?s note, you?re basically screwed — quite a comfort to the thousands of Americans living without health insurance who can?t afford a trip to the doctor for anything that isn?t life-threatening.But, y?know, it?s obvious that we have the greatest health care system in the world and all, as long as you lack a basic understanding of the meaning of any of the words in that statement.The only flip-side to this is that if a place does fire you after you suffer a medical issue, they?re rightly in trouble if they try to fight an unemployment claim in most states.This one I know from experience.Still, since my weekly unemployment check was $131, that?s cold comfort.Jessica should head to youtube and type ?ASMR? into the search box.Looks like Dubner is an accidental member of the ASMR community!Previous Post Hacking the World Bank: A New Freakonomics Radio Podcast This Idea Must Die: A New Freakonomics Radio Podcast Are you an idea junkie?Of course you are!It’s exciting to hear about ideas, especially new ones.There’s a progression...
