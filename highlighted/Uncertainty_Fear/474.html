Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Wednesday, March 11.It's time to stop and listen.Cramer said that in times of chaos and uncertainty about the direction of the market, one should stop and listen.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He said that it's easy to lose focus amidst the rate hike fears and investors should instead listen to what the executives at companies are really saying.</span>He reminded investors about the talk with Ford (NYSE: F ) CEO Mark Fields, who mentioned that a rise in interest rates is a sign of a healthy economy.CEOs Indra Nooyi (NYSE: PEP ) and Howard Schultz (NASDAQ: SBUX ) also reiterated the long-term view of a healthy U.S. economy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>During the Asian currency crisis of 1997-98, there were fears too.</span>Cramer said that while the crisis affected some sections of the stock market, it did not hurt the economy, which was in fact good.Hence Cramer advised investors to take a long-term approach and not indulge in short-term trades.While there may be hitches in the stock prices for the near term, it should be viewed as an opportunity to buy for the long term.CEO interview - Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) Cramer had recommended investors to buy Under Armour when it was making a debut several years ago.The stock rallied on the first day and has never looked back since then."Under Armour is what I like to call a stealth technology company," said Cramer.He thinks it's a high quality stock to own as the company is at the centre of innovation when it comes to sports footwear and apparel.He attributes the company's success to CEO Kevin Plank, whom he interviewed on the show."We have over 130M people in our digital network.Because we had this great healthy shirts-and-shoes business, we were able to build this new layer of adding digital to our business that will give us this new complexion that I think presents us to be ready for the next decade of growth," said Plank.He added that since more and more people are ordering using handheld devices, Under Armour is ready to take the opportunity of growing digitally.Plank mentioned that when shoppers walk into a store, they are always looking down at their phones to compare pricing and obtain data on what they are looking for, and Under Armour is looking to be at the centre of this information delivery.He also mentioned that by 2020, approximately 25-50B retail items will have a connected chip and Under Armour wants to be a part of connected apparel.One thing that Cramer had learned in the ten years of hosting Mad Money, is that the best companies should be bought in a market-wide selloff.Cramer talked about Disney, one of his favorite stocks that delivered tremendous growth over the years on the strength of its business.He thinks highly of CEO Bob Iger, and interviewed him to find out more about the opening of the new Disneyland in Shanghai.Iger was very excited about the upcoming movie Cinderella followed by Avengers and Star Wars.Commenting on the new Disneyland opening in Shanghai, he said, "We are going to be really careful about how we manage our first guests because we think that demand from the most populous city in the most populous country in the world is going to be really high.There will obviously be a high curiosity factor as well."He added that Disneyland will be very unique to China, and hence they thought it would be wise to add $800M for expansion to one of the most advanced theme parks the company has ever built.Cramer thinks the stock is a long-term buy.Where is the collapse in oil everyone was talking about?The belief of oil companies going bust at $48 has been wrong, as there is no sign of collapse.The junk bond market which was flooded with $200B oil and gas paper when oil was at $90 is still intact.In fact, the iShares high yield corporate bond ETF (NYSEARCA: HYG ) has pretty much sustained its rally since the bottom where most oil stocks hit their low."That's right, the real-time indicator of these bonds is saying not to worry," said Cramer.Cramer also thinks that the oil production number won't go down, while people believe otherwise.Although the rig counts have gone down, most companies are still producing oil in big numbers.Cramer thinks the reason oil has not collapsed yet is the stock market.Since the collapse of oil, almost 25 troubled companies have raised $8.3B from the stock market to fund drilling or pay off debt.Cramer thinks there are other factors keeping oil from collapsing: Banks have been lending money to oil players.Cost of drilling has come down from $29,000 per day to $20,000.Drilling time has also come down substantially, thanks to new technology."Put it all together, and I am making a bold call here.If oil stays even at these reduced levels, I am calling this the crash that never happened," said Cramer."The oil stocks may not be any good, but there's no catastrophe waiting in the wings, and that's what matters," he added.This is still no reason to buy oil stocks as Cramer said he would rather buy the retail chains and the supermarkets which will benefit from lower oil price.Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ): Cramer likes the stock.AT&T (NYSE: T ): Cramer thinks that Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has better growth opportunities while AT&T has better yield.Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.Start your FREE 14-day trial
