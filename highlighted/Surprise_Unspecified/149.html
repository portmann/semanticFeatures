Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Monday, March 9.Cramer started the show by kicking off the 10th anniversary celebration of Mad Money.He mentioned how he got on the show at CNBC from a show called Real Money on radio, and the late Mark Haines helped him get there.Cramer started the 10th anniversary week by interviewing some of the best leaders in the business.Pepsi is a real blue chip and has been creating excellent value for shareholders, according to Cramer.He said the company has been transformed from someone in the junk food business, to a giant introducing more delicious and healthy snacks.The stock has come down after touching the $100 mark and Cramer thinks it is a good entry point for investors.He interviewed the CEO Indra Nooyi to discuss the company."I think the reason why PepsiCo has delivered so well is because we have a history of being very adaptable.We have changed the company when we needed to in anticipation of mega trends.We have had the courage to make all the right moves, and we have delivered.Our performance has been fairly consistent over the years," said Nooyi.She said the company's portfolio of products suits everyone.There are 'fun for you' products like Pepsi, Lays etc; 'better for you' products like Diet Pepsi and 'good for you' products like Quaker Oats.She also mentioned that the board of directors keeps forcing the company to think about future products.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Commenting on the question raised by Cramer that food and beverage should be separate companies, Nooyi said that when Nelson Peltz and Bill Johnson join the board, they will be surprised to see that Pepsi is a well architected company where both food and beverage have a place.</span>She believes that consumers should not have to choose between a 'fun for you' and 'good for you' product."For a company like PepsiCo to sustain its growth, we don't swing the pendulum one way or the other.You offer the entire range of products," said Nooyi.While skeptics say that it is not possible to beat the market consistently, Cramer thinks it can be done if you pick the best stocks of companies with a strong management.One such company is Starbucks, which has been going higher on the back of a strong quarter and low coffee prices.Cramer thinks in the near future the stock will cross $100 mark.He interviewed CEO Howard Schultz to find out what makes the company so successful.Schultz said that the people behind the counter make the difference."From the very beginning we started out not as a franchise system, but as a company-owned system.We recognized early on that if we were going to be a company-owned system that the cultural values and guiding principles, mainly our people, are going to be the equity of the brand," said Schultz.He added that the company recently raised wages for its employees and introduced a college achievement plan."Success is best when it is shared.Every time we raise value for a shareholder, we raise value for our people."Schultz added that they have replicated the model in China as well, where they have opened 1,600 stores, with 300 in Shanghai alone.He spoke repeatedly of the importance of employees in China and talked about the annual family meetings to show respect to employees, parents and children.Commenting on the company's success in China, he said, "What we have established in China is no small feat.I think over time there will be thousands of stores, and it is very possible that one day China will be larger than the U.S. market.But I also think this is a challenging environment."He added that China is a profitable market and the company is just getting started.The company is also doing well in India and Schultz said that their local designs are doing well.The company has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to technology, or introducing a new brand.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN ) Cramer said that the CEO Dr. Leonard Schleifer was the first ever executive to be interviewed by him and that Regeneron has come a long way since then.The company has a solid product pipeline that can deliver high revenue in the future, subject to FDA approval.Cramer said that Regeneron has been making a fortune for investors and he interviewed the CEO as a part of the 10th anniversary celebration."The thing about this business is that it's all based on what you do for patients.This is not the soap business or the detergent business where marketing clout matters.The bottom line is if you come out with a product that makes a difference for patients, you're going to sell the product, patients are going to do better and your investors and shareholders are going to profit as well," said Schleifer.Commenting on the upcoming drug for cardiovascular risk, Schleifer noted that the company has seen good clinical results and is hopeful that everything goes right with the FDA approval in July.He said that Regeneron's success is owed to Dr George Yancopoulos who has been a creative genius."Just own Apple, don't trade it," said Cramer.He has been saying this repeatedly, and it was evident from Monday's trade that you can get burned if you come to trade in Apple based on some information.As people got excited about the new iWatch, the stock went higher.After people realized that it has an 18 hour battery life, the stock gave up all its gains."Trading Apple is a fool's game because of the lack of short-term information that exists about the company, and because the expectations are all over the map," said Cramer.He said that lesser than expected battery life is no reason to sell the stock.You buy it because it is cheaper than the average stock in the S&P 500.He said that the battery life will catch up eventually and the iWatch is more than just a watch.In the future it could be a life-saving medical device that sends the stats to a doctor when something goes wrong.He added that soon developers will find a way to use the watch more judiciously.Alcoa (NYSE: AA ): Cramer thinks Alcoa should be bought only with a nine month perspective after the payoff kicks in.Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s
