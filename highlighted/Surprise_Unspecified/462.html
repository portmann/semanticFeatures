Includes: EPI , INCO , INDA , INDY , INP , INXX , PIN , SCIF , SCIN , SMIN by: Zacks Funds The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surprised the global market yet again today with a second cut in interest rate within two months, citing weakness in Asia's third-largest economy.</span>The central bank slashed its key interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 7.5%.The move follows the interest rate cut of 25 bps in January, which was the first rate cut in about two years to ease stubborn inflation.Though inflation has moderated in recent months on falling oil prices and softness in food prices, and is well below the central bank's medium term target of 6%, it rose 5.11% in January representing the third-fastest increase among 17 Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg.The rate cut came just a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented his first annual budget, and the government and central bank agreed to a biggest change in monetary policy by introducing flexible inflation to rein in volatile consumer prices.The agreement between two sides pegged the inflation target at below 6% by January 2016 and then seeks to bring inflation to the midpoint of 2-6% by April 2018.Any deviation from the inflation target range for the three consecutive quarters would be treated as failure by the central bank.As a result, RBI has to determine the country's interest rate accordingly to achieve the inflation target.Market believes that the next rate cut will not happen before the scheduled April policy review if inflation continues to increase.The sudden move by RBI spurred a rally in the Indian stocks.The BSE Sensex scaled to new highs breaching the major threshold of 30,000 for the first time while CNX Nifty breezed past the 9,100 mark on the day.Meanwhile, government bonds surged to their highest level in nearly 20 months while the Indian rupee halted a three-day decline and jumped to a one-month high against the dollar.Smooth trading is expected in the ETF world as well.There are several options currently available in the space that investors need to watch carefully and tap the opportunity when it arises.In fact, Indian ETFs have been the best performing funds in the Asia-Pacific from a one-year look with small caps leading the way.In particular, iShares MSCI India Small Cap Index Fund (BATS: SMIN ), EGShares Indxx India Small Cap Fund (NYSEARCA: SCIN ) and Market Vectors India Small-Cap Fund (NYSEARCA: SCIF ) surged about 83%, 74% and 65.5%, respectively, in the same period.These funds focusing on pint-sized stocks look attractive for long-term investment, given their focus on the growing middle class.Further, they are immune to global economic twists and turns compared to their large cap cousins.The two ultra-popular funds include iShares MSCI India ETF (BATS: INDA ) and WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (NYSEARCA: EPI ), having AUM of $3.1 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.The former tracks the large cap stocks based on market caps while the latter targets the profitable companies using an earnings-weighted methodology.Apart from these, iShares India 50 ETF (NASDAQ: INDY ), PowerShares India Portfolio (NYSEARCA: PIN ) and iPath MSCI India Index ETN (NYSEARCA: INP ) also seem great plays although volume is light for all.All the funds have delivered double-digit returns so far in the year.Other ETFs to look at are EGShares India Consumer ETF (NYSEARCA: INCO ) and EGShares India Infrastructure Index Fund (NYSEARCA: INXX ), which seem well positioned to benefit from the fast rising consumer and infrastructure spending in India.INCO is the top performing India ETF of this year, having gained about 15% while INXX added less than 10%.All the funds mentioned here have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or Buy rating except INCO, which has Zacks ETF Rank of 1 or 'Strong Buy' rating.The bullish trend is likely to continue this year thanks to an improving economy after the pro-growth government took office in May.Additionally, narrowing current account deficit, modest decline in inflation, stabilization of rupee and incredible foreign capital inflows are creating the appeal for Indian stocks and the related ETFs.Lower oil prices and rising consumer spending have added to further economic strength.Notably, India imports more than 75% of its oil requirements, thus being highly susceptible to oil prices.We only use your contact details to
