the company has a market cap of over $19 billion.HCP specializes in senior housing and post acute care facilities.The company has grown its dividends per share at about 3.3% a year over the last decade.If HCP can continue to grow at 3.3% a year, investors will see total returns of 8.7% a year from both growth and dividend income.I believe it is very likely that HCP continues to grow by at least its historical 10-year growth rate (if not faster).Demand for the company's senior housing facilities will pick up as ever greater number of baby boomers retire and reach old age.This, combined with longer life expectancies will increase the need for HCP's senior housing facilities, which will drive the company's growth.The highest yielding Dividend Aristocrat is AT&T.AT&T currently has a 5.5% dividend yield.The company has increased its dividend payments for 31 consecutive years.AT&T is the 2nd largest telecommunications company in the U.S.; AT&T has a market cap of more than $176 billion.AT&T has managed to grow at about 4% a year over the last decade.The company has transitioned from a traditional telephone company (long ago) to becoming one of the two most dominant wireless carriers in the U.S. AT&T may very well grow faster over the next several years than it has over the last decade.The company is acquiring DirecTV .The DirecTV acquisition could spur growth for the company, as DirecTV has a strong presence in Latin America which AT&T could leverage.Additionally, AT&T stands to benefit from the trend of using ever greater amounts of wireless data.Smart phone data usage is quickly growing.As data usage grows, so does the demand and necessity of AT&T's services.Of the 5 highest yielding Dividend Aristocrats, only Chevron and AT&T rank highly using the 8 Rules of Dividend Investing.Both AT&T and Chevron have low price-to-earnings ratios, high dividend yields, and solid-if-unspectacular growth prospects.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
