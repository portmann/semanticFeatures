(NASDAQ:FEYE) | Seeking Alpha FireEye reported a 163% revenue increase in 2014 and is forecasting an additional 50% growth in 2015.The company gained notoriety in the first quarter of 2014 on word that its software had identified a breach at Target before it became a bigger issue.It's estimated that the penetration rates for next generation cybersecurity are still less than 10% leaving a lot of room for further revenue growth and investment.FireEye could end up being a takeover target for a big technology firm like Cisco.Every time news breaks that another company's data has been breached, the spotlight shining on cybersecurity stocks gets a little brighter.These are the companies that are trying to get in front of cyberattacks and protect both corporate and customer information.Given that some of the biggest companies in the world have already fallen victim to security breaches no amount of money seems like too much when it comes to spending on cybersecurity.Cybersecurity stocks like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW ), Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT ) and CyberArk Software (NASDAQ: CYBR ) have all been red hot lately as demand for its products grows.My choice in the space though is FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE ).FireEye - one of the cybersecurity companies that provides forensics and security packages and tries to identify potential hacks before they happen - debuted late in 2013 at $20 and nearly doubled by the end of its first trading day.It gained notoriety in the first quarter of 2014 on word that their software had identified a breach at Target (NYSE: TGT ) before it turned into a major event that cost the CEO his job.The stock price went north of $90 before it cooled off and gave back about half of its value.I think that right now FireEye could be set up for a big year in 2015 and beyond.Here are four reasons why.FireEye isn't an earnings play right now.It's a pure revenue play.The company reported solid results in Q4 2014 and wrapped up the year with total revenue of $425M - a 163% increase from the $162M in revenue in 2013 - and is forecasting another almost 50% jump in 2015 to a range of $605M to $625M.FireEye also added more than 1000 new customers in 2014 and could end up doing even better in 2015.Quite simply, FireEye is having trouble keeping up with the demand for its products.Even more encouraging is the fact that adoption of these next generation security features is still in its infancy so it's not unreasonable to think that FireEye could be in line to pick up many more customers over the next several years.As long as the company is able to manage its own organic growth, this could be a huge growth opportunity for quite a while.About a year prior to the merger of Mandiant into FireEye , the two companies had engaged in a technology development and sharing agreement in order to deploy their products together so an official merger into one company makes sense.The two companies had their own specific niches - FireEye focuses on virus detection while Mandiant deals primarily with cyber attacks - and now can offer their package services along with Mandiant's strength in forensics together as one bundle deal.While the market popped initially at the news, the FireEye-Mandiant merger hasn't been all smooth sailing as the combined entity has had some difficulties integrating together.Now, they seem to have the kinks worked out and appear ready to fully recognize the benefits of the partnership.Both companies have had individual success in identifying specific threats and together should be positioned as a major player for both software and cyber threat side protection.This article states that the penetration rates for next generation cybersecurity are still less than 10%.That means there is still a lot of money yet to be spent on this technology.Corporations of all sizes as well as many government agencies could end up backing up the truck to combat this problem.The tale of Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel losing his job over the company's data breach (yes, there may have been other factors at play but it's probably safe to say the data breach was the main factor) is one that no sitting CEO wants to experience for themselves so companies should be allocating significant chunks of their technology budgets to cybersecurity over the next several years.The cybersecurity boom is still in its early stages and like many product cycles in their infancy, the sector is very fractured.You have a lot of players all scrambling to gain market share and become the dominant player.Many of the big name technology players will find it easier to buy someone else's technology than develop it themselves in house.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That's why I wouldn't be surprised to see a big name like Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) or maybe even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) try to pick up a company like FireEye in order to integrate its software suite into their products.</span>The premium that almost always comes from being bought out would be a huge benefit for shareholders.Despite the recent popularity of cybersecurity companies lately, I still see a lot of upside in this sector over the next several years.FireEye is inching ever closer to profitability although it still has a ways to go.Revenue growth should remain strong over the next few years and the company's cash flow burn has started to moderate.CEO Dave Dewalt went on CNBC recently and confirmed that the company broke even on operating cash flow in the most recent quarter and is forecasting 20-25% operating margins over the next 3-5 years.But to be fair, it's not a stock without risks.FireEye is not expected to be profitable (EPS, EBITDA and margins are all forecasted to be negative) through at least 2017.As mentioned above, there are many companies competing in the cybersecurity space and it's still unclear who will emerge in a few years.And let's not forget that FireEye is only one missed hack away from losing the trust of any current or future customer and potentially bankrupting the business altogether.But based on forecasted demand growth as well as an already improving balance sheet and cash flow statement along with some proven success with its products, I still like FireEye as a solid long-term investment.Source: 4 Reasons Why FireEye Is My Top Pick In The Cybersecurity Space Disclosure: The author is long FEYE.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
