Parnell, CFA Investors are rushing to the European side of the global stock market ship.Beware of pouring into European stocks simply because QE is now underway.ECB QE is not necessarily the same as Fed QE.Recent history has shown that a QE program is not necessarily a sure-fire guarantee to send regional stock prices higher.More attractive returns opportunities may eventually reside elsewhere as the program continues into the future.Investors are rushing to the European side of the global stock market ship.In a world that seemingly values the next dollar being printed by a global central banker more than underlying fundamental growth prospects, capital markets in the eurozone have been scrambling higher in recent months following the announcement by the European Central Bank (ECB) that it too is implementing its own quantitative easing program.The case for overweighting Europe is certainly reasonable, particularly given the attractive stock valuations relative to those found in the U.S. With that said, investors should beware of pouring into European stocks simply because QE is now underway.ECB QE is not necessarily the same as Fed QE.And recent history has shown that a QE program is not necessarily a sure-fire guarantee to send stock prices higher.European stock market gains have certainly been impressive in recent months.In three examples among many, the German DAX Composite, the French CAC 40 and the Spanish IBEX 35 indices are all strongly positive for the year.This compares favorably to the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA: SPY ) in the United States, which turned negative on a price basis for the year to date following Tuesday's sharp sell-off.A primary driver of the enthusiasm for European stocks has been the anticipation of the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program that includes the intention to purchase more than 1.1 trillion euros in assets between now and September 2016.Of course, the decision by a central bank to aggressively print its currency is not without spillover effects.And such influences have been particularly profound in the currency markets, as the euro currency has weakened by more than -12% year to date relative to the U.S. dollar.As a result, the strong outperformance enjoyed by European markets such as Germany (NYSEARCA: EWG ), France (NYSEARCA: EWQ ) and Spain (NYSEARCA: EWP ) relative to the U.S. has effectively been neutralized on an unhedged currency basis.This serves as an important initial reminder.When seeking to capitalize on the benefits of these various global QE programs, it is not about getting the broader theme right and simply allocating to stocks associated with the region implementing the program.Instead, both the specific positioning and specific timing must also be correct.And while the Fed's various QE programs during the post crisis period has made this process seem relatively easy, the fact that these programs are now taking place around the world at a time when the controller of the global reserve currency in the Fed appears intent on tightening causes this implementation process to become far more complex with numerous additional input variables to consider.For example, will the liquidity being produced by the ECB simply remain content to stay the eurozone where future growth prospects remain suspect and the currency continues to chronically weaken?Or will money flow outside of the region to destinations such as the United States where economic growth appears relatively more attractive and at the same time whose sovereign bonds are yielding a couple of percentage points more in yield (after all, for while the U.S. stock market sports a premium valuation to Europe, excess liquidity does not necessarily need to flow broadly into the stock market)?And what about the negative effects of the sharply rising dollar on the global economy including those many struggling emerging markets whose debt is denominated in U.S. dollars?And given its intent to raise interest rates, will the Fed be able to maintain order in its own capital markets once investors increasingly realized that higher rates may be coming sooner than they anticipate (if the market reaction following last Friday's jobs report is any indication, this will be a task that requires a gingerly touch and a lot of soothing if nothing else)?These are just few of the many questions that investors should be considering as they navigate their way through 2015 and beyond.But the most likely outcome more than anything else for global investors is pain in the form of increased asset price volatility.For the sake of discussion, let's just assume that all else is held equal.Under a more controlled environment where many of the uncertainties mentioned above are held constant, what might investors reasonably expect going forward from Europe's aggressive QE program?Certainly, the injection of liquidity by central bankers into capital markets is likely to have a net stimulative effect on asset prices.But the bigger question is exactly how much?In trying to answer this question, it is instructive to examine the extraordinarily aggressive quantitative easing program launched by the Bank of Japan a few years ago.For a number of similarities have started to form at least in the early stages of the ECB's new program.The Bank of Japan (BOJ) introduced its quantitative easing program to capital markets with much fanfare on April 4, 2013.But at the time, the launch of the program was essentially a foregone conclusion.In short, investors basically knew it was coming as early as November 2012 once it became apparent that current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was set to win the election on December 16, 2012.As a result, the Japanese stock market had been rising for months in anticipation of the program.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Instead, the main surprise coming from the BOJ's April announcement was the extraordinary magnitude of the program, as it revealed its intent to effectively double the yen money supply over the course of less than two years.</span>Put simply, it was a QE program that would leave Helicopter Ben blushing.The staggering size of the BOJ's QE program helped propel Japanese stocks (NYSEARCA: EWJ ) higher for another month into May 2013.But then the gains stalled.Sure, the so-called U.S. "taper tantrum" took its toll through June 2013, but while the U.S. stock market would go on to increase by a third over the next year and a half, gains in the Japanese stock market have been effectively stalled since.Even after the BOJ announced that it was expanding its already aggressive QE program even further at the end of October 2014, the Japanese stock market has been effectively flat following a fleeting burst following the announcement.Now one might understandably point to the weakening yen currency (NYSEARCA: FXY ) as the culprit for these stagnant Japanese stock market results.But when dissecting the value of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar, we discover that the associated impact from currency effects has been generally isolated since the launch of BOJ QE.For much of the weakening in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar took place in anticipation of the program.For not long after it was actually launched, the yen remained essentially flat versus the U.S. dollar through August 2014.And it was only after the BOJ expanded its QE program even further that the yen currency took its next decisive leg lower.But since early December 2014 to to-date, the yen has once again been effectively flat versus the U.S. dollar.So while the weakening of the yen currency has certainly had its impact, these forces almost fully played out either in anticipation or in the immediate aftermath of a change in policy action.Even when factoring in currency effects, the performance of the Japanese stock market has been generally unexciting since the launch of its massive QE program.Even on a currency-hedged basis (NYSEARCA: DXJ ), Japanese stocks peaked in mid May 2013 not long after the launch of the program and remained trapped under this level until the end of October 2014, which not coincidentally was when the BOJ expanded its program even further.Notably in the months that followed, it was only upon the build up toward the ECB's program in January 2015 that we have finally seen a sustained move higher in Japanese stocks on a currency-hedged basis.What can we conclude from the Japanese stock market experience under its massive QE program.Nearly all of the benefits of asset price inflation took place either in advance or immediately following the launch of the program or its subsequent expansion.And all of this took place in a global investment backdrop that included the U.S. Federal Reserve for much of this same time implementing its own aggressive QE stimulus program also with the intent to boost asset prices.Of course, such is not likely to be the case in the months ahead.Translating the Japanese QE Experience To Europe The forces at work in Europe are certainly different from those in Japan.And a sample of one is certainly insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions about what we might expect from Europe going forward.But some notable similarities are already presenting themselves with the European QE experience.First, once it became readily apparent that ECB President Mario Draghi intended to finally follow through on his promise to do "whatever it takes" to support growth in the eurozone, European stocks began to rally strongly in anticipation of the program.And when Mr. Draghi in the spirit of a Wall Street stock analyst strategically worked to exceed market expectations with the actual QE announcement on January 22, 2015, European markets (NYSEARCA: EZU ) accelerated their advance.Hence the more than +20% aggregate advance in European stock markets across the region in recent weeks.Second, the euro currency (NYSEARCA: FXE ) has so far weakened dramatically relative to the U.S. dollar.Much like the Japanese yen from November 2012 to May 2013, the euro has declined by nearly -25% in value since last summer.Thus, while local stock market gains have been robust, gains have been more subdued for the U.S.-based investor on an unhedged currency basis.Third, robust currency-hedged (NYSEARCA: HEDJ ) gains have continued in Europe despite the recent weakness on a currency unhedged basis.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is not surprising given that it is difficult to find a institutional money manager or hedge fund that has not gone rushing into European stock markets in recent weeks in anticipation of the ECB's QE program.</span>And just as they did back in the spring of 2013 in Japan with the currency hedged DXJ, these investors have done so with confidence yet again today.Lastly, just as it did in May 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve stands ready to continue prepping global capital markets for the potential for higher target interest rate as soon as its next scheduled FOMC meeting on March 17-18 when the word "patient" is expected to be dropped from the statement language, thus putting an end to the Fed's forward guidance.To date, investment markets remain skeptical that the Fed will move to raise interest rates anytime soon, as evidenced by CME futures that are pricing in a 21% probability for a rate hike in June, a 43% chance in July, and a 62% probability in September.Put simply, these probabilities have the potential to rise substantially in the coming days and weeks if those analysts and researchers that know the Fed well who have been predicting that the Fed will raise rates in June turn out to be prescient in their calls.And such an outcome has the potential to put further downward pressure on a global marketplace that has already likely been weakening in adjusting to the likelihood for higher U.S. interest rates going forward.So just as we witnessed with Japan back in late 2012 and early 2013, European stock markets have risen sharply in anticipation of the program.And they are likely to continue to rally in the coming days as the program now gets underway.But a variety of uncertainties exist once QE dreams become reality.Exactly where will the recipients of this ECB liquidity deploy the capital?Will it be in European stocks, or somewhere else entirely where perhaps a higher and more secure rate of return might be on offer?Also, how much liquidity will actually flow from the ECB QE program at the end of the day?If the ECB is already buying bonds with negative yields on the first day of the program, what will be available for the ECB to buy several months into its massive 1.1 trillion euro program?And how efficiently will this liquidity find its way to capital markets?At a minimum, it is not likely to be as smooth as the Treasury purchases that the U.S. Federal Reserve publicly scheduled a month in advance and performed on a daily basis.Lastly, will the ECB's QE program actually work in generating inflation or any form of sustainable economic growth?After all, past QE programs from other major central banks have fallen well short of the mark in this regard, so should we expect a different outcome this time around?Only time will tell, but if nothing else, investors should expect much higher risk levels and volatility (NYSEARCA: VXX ) along the way versus what they have become accustomed in the recent past.The ECB's QE program is now underway.And it will bring a new flow of liquidity into capital markets.But this is not U.S. Federal Reserve QE, as a variety of additional variables are at work that investors should be considering before making asset allocations.So while the binary trade of going long currency-hedged European stocks may work well in the short term, it may quickly lose its efficacy just as being long currency-hedged Japanese stocks did not long stay after the launch of the BOJ's QE.Investors are scrambling into European stock markets at the moment, but it may not be long before the boat tips too far to one side and subsequent volatility has investors scrambling elsewhere.So where might this capital flow?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Perhaps surprisingly, it could end up flowing once again to the United States.</span>This flow may not happen immediately as investors adjust to the potential for the Federal Reserve to actually raise target interest rates for the first time in roughly a decade, but eventually as global investors continue to search for high-quality securities that offer attractive yield in an income starved marketplace.This may include U.S. Treasuries (NYSEARCA: TLT ), preferred stocks (NYSEARCA: PFF ), utilities (NYSEARCA: XLU ), REITs (NYSEARCA: VNQ ) and dividend growth stocks (NYSEARCA: SDY ).Valuations are already rich across all of these sectors, however, so investors may also need to be selective and pick their spots in these securities as we move through 2015.For as recent trading days have clearly shown, these market segments are also not immune to their own spells of extreme volatility.Disclosure: This article is
