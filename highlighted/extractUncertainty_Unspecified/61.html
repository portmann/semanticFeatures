price of $57 is trading at an 18% discount to our fair intrinsic value of $70.TEVA's adjusted PE ratio is well below its pharmaceutical industry peers.TEVA generates strong free cash flows ($3.7 Billion in 2014), and we expect TEVA to boost its dividend by at least 12% annually over the next five years.TEVA resumed its share repurchase plan in Q4 2014 by repurchasing $500 Million shares, and we expect TEVA to repurchase at least $1 Billion annually over the next five years.We recommend Teva Pharmaceutical American Depository Receipts (NYSE: TEVA ) as an Accumulate based on relative valuation and improving earnings prospects, fair value price of $70 per share.We also recommend that aggressive investors should finance their long position in TEVA with a short position in Actavis plc (NYSE: ACT ).We reduce our rating on TEVA from Strong Buy to Accumulate and increase our fair value target share price from $66 to $70 as the price of TEVA's shares is at an 18% discount to our estimated fair value.We expect to see the company generate earnings per ADR share of $3.92 in 2015 and to increase ADR EPS by 12% annually over the following four years.We like that it generates strong free cash flows.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Though TEVA is not debt free, the company generated $3.7 Billion in free cash flows last year and we think TEVA could reduce its debt from $12.2 Billion in 2013 to $8.2 Billion in 2016 (particularly because of its recent debt tender offer ).</span>The firm has been able to maintain or grow its dividend every year since 1990 while many of its larger competitors saw itself forced to cut or freeze dividends.Starting in Q1 2015, TEVA plans to pay its dividends in US Dollars instead of Israeli Shekels.TEVA also resumed its share repurchase plan in Q4 2014 by repurchasing $500 Million shares, and we expect TEVA to repurchase at least $1 Billion annually going forward.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe the price to earnings ratio is still significantly low.</span>TEVA's adjusted PE based on non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $5.19 is 11x its adjusted 2015 EPS and is at least 20-60% below its generic peer group.Although most of the deal chatter surrounding TEVA relates to potential acquisitions, we see the potential for TEVA to be acquired at a premium .<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) proposed acquiring AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN ) for nearly $120 Billion last year, before that deal was rejected.</span>Actavis plc announced its acquisition of Allergan (NYSE: AGN ), and it spent $25 Billion to acquire Forest Laboratories.Mylan announced it would acquire Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE: ABT ) generic-drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion, and it acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care to expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.Shire (NASDAQ: SHPG ) agreed to acquire NPS Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: NPSP ) for $5.2 Billion.We are optimistic with its product pipeline.TEVA launched 315 new generic products in 2014, which yielded $1 Billion in new revenues and has 120 generic product registrations awaiting FDA approval.TEVA is also launching generic versions of Nexium, Diovan and Celebrex.TEVA also launched four new products in its Specialty Medicines business that brought in $200 Million in new revenues, and TEVA seeks to bring seven new products to market in 2015, which will bring in $400 Million in estimated new revenues.Copaxone's resilience: Although Copaxone's 20mg/daily treatment product loses patent protection in September 2015, TEVA's Copaxone 40mg (3X per week) product has gained 19.6% market share in the multiple sclerosis marketplace and accounts for 63% of TEVA's Copaxone product franchise.TEVA actually has the same number of patients on Copaxone today that it had before the launch of Tecfidera by Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB ).TEVA is undervalued relative to the major global branded pharmaceuticals firms.Although TEVA's market capitalization is significantly smaller than the nine largest major global branded pharmaceutical firms, its adjusted PE is less than these firms.While TEVA's closest competition is the generic pharmaceutical firms, TEVA's Specialty Medicines division (which closely correlates with the global branded pharmaceuticals giants) represented 42% of TEVA's revenue and 66% of its operating income.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even when considering the headwinds TEVA will face in 2015 and 2016 when Copaxone goes off patent, we believe that TEVA offers greater long-term growth potential than other branded pharmaceutical firms and its 11X PE is much cheaper than the 16.7X PE of the average branded pharmaceutical firm.</span>TEVA's dividend growth (21.35%) was also well ahead of the average branded pharmaceutical firm (8.22%) during the last 13 years.New CEO has experience with turnarounds and dealing with TEVA's mercurial Board of Directors.Teva's new CEO Erez Vigodman served on TEVA's board since 2009 and has experience in managing relations with TEVA's board.TEVA's former CEO Dr. Jeremy Levin left the company following tensions between the company's management and its board after public criticism of TEVA's massive layoff plans.Vigodman also has experience with turnaround situations based on his experience as CEO of Makhteshim Agan Industries and Strauss Group.Erez Vigodman began serving as TEVA's CEO in February 2014 and came to TEVA from Israeli agricultural chemical maker Makhteshim Agan Industries, where he served as CEO from 2010 to 2014.Vigodman also served as the CEO of Israeli food company Strauss Group from 2001 to 2009.Eyal Desheh has served as TEVA's CFO since 2008, except for a three-month stint (November 2013 to February 2014) when he served as TEVA's interim CEO when the board fired Dr. Jeremy Levin as CEO.Desheh also served as CFO of Check Point Software (NASDAQ: CHKP ) from 2000 to 2008 and as Deputy CFO of TEVA from 1989 to 1996.Dr. Philip Frost served as Chairman of the Board of TEVA from 2010 to 2014.He replaced the late Eli Hurvitz who retired in 2010 from the company after 57 years of service, including serving as President and CEO from 1977-2002.Eli Hurvitz was the leader who transformed TEVA from a local pharmaceutical company in Israel to a preeminent global pharmaceuticals leader.Hurvitz's son Chaim served the company as either an executive or director from 1992 to 2014.Frost recently stepped down from TEVA's board and Professor Yitzhak Peterburg succeeded him as Chairman.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Dr. Michael Hayden joined TEVA in May 2012 and serves as TEVA's President of Global R&D and Chief Scientific Officer.</span>Dr. Hayden founded three biotechnology companies: NeuroVir; Aspreva Pharmaceuticals; and Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Dr. Hayden has an outstanding record in research that has led directly to medicines that have made a substantial difference to patients around the world.</span>His work in genetics and personalized medicine is internationally renowned, and he is one of the world's leading experts on Huntington's disease.Sigurdur Olafsson joined TEVA in July 2014 as TEVA's new President and CEO of its Global Generics Medicines Group.Prior to joining TEVA, he served as an executive with TEVA's competitor Actavis plc and its predecessors for 11 years.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Source: Strauss Group Investor Relations Ownership: TEVA's directors and executive officers as a group beneficially held 21.7 Million ordinary shares, representing approximately 2.3% of the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2014.</span>This figure includes 14.4 Million shares beneficially owned by Dr. Phillip Frost, the former Chairman of TEVA and former Chairman and CEO of IVAX Corporation, which TEVA acquired in 2006.Teva's legendary former CEO Eli Hurvitz owned 10.06 Million shares of TEVA before he passed away in 2011.Notable institutional shareholders include the following firms: Templeton Worldwide (18.2 Million shares, 2.13%), Mondrian Investment Partners (11 Million shares, 1.29%), Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss LLC (10.4 Million shares, 1.21%), PointState Capital LP (10.4 Million shares, 1.22%), Highfields Capital Management (6.4 Million shares, 0.75%), Soros Fund Management (6.2 Million shares, 0.73%), French asset manager ï¿½douard Carmignac's Carmignac Gestion (6.1 Million shares, 0.72%), and We like the fact that the firm has been able to increase their solid gross margins from 43.5% in 2002 to 54.5% in 2014.We expect TEVA will maintain or steadily expand their gross margins due to their mammoth scale and growth from acquisitions, organic growth and cost-cutting efforts by TEVA's management.TEVA has increased its revenue from $2.5 Billion in 2002 to $20.3 Billion in 2014 and its EPS from $.76 to $3.56 during the same time period.TEVA achieved this through organic volume growth and through a number of strategic acquisitions.Although TEVA's global corporate headquarters is in Israel, only 3% of its revenues come from Israel.TEVA has a strong market share penetration for its products.Copaxone, TEVA's Multiple Sclerosis drug, has a US market share of 31.4% for total prescriptions and 25.9% for new prescriptions and is the leading treatment in the multiple sclerosis product market.TEVA is also the leading generic drug maker in the US with about 20% of the market share in the US generic market.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We also believe that the firm can achieve operating leverage improvements.</span>In 2006, TEVA's selling, general and administrative expenses were 18.7% of revenue ($1.57 Billion) and the company increased it to 26.2% in 2013 ($5.3 Billion).TEVA made great progress in reducing its selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 as it reduced these expenses by 4.5%, and it seeks to reduce its net cost base by $500 Million further in 2015 in order to bolster operating margins and reinvest in higher productivity projects and operations.This shows that TEVA is on target in its efforts to reduce its gross expenses by $2 Billion annually in 2017.TEVA also increased Research and Development spending from $495 Million in sales (5.9% of sales) to $1.5 Billion for 2014 (7% of sales).VALUATION, PROJECTIONS AND RECENT EVENTS Our $70 per ADR fair value is based on applying a 18 times Price to Earnings multiple to estimated 2019 earnings per ADR share of $6.07 and discounting the terminal value back to February 2015 at a cost of capital of 11%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We believe the PE of 18x reported EPS is justified due to TEVA's superior pharmaceuticals franchise and strength in generic pharmaceuticals.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In addition, we believe that the multiple used is justified considering that the firm has previously grown its EPS faster than its industry, it continues to grow its dividends faster than the industry and its price had declined by 44% from its March 2010 highs to its lows in November 2013.</span>Since then TEVA saw its share price rebound and generate a total return of 64% due to the following positive factors: Progress in reducing its operating expenses, Reducing its outstanding debt by $1.9 Billion enabled it to reduce its interest expenses by 21.5%, Significant reductions in its "non-recurring charges" due to litigation, asset impairments and restructuring, and We see TEVA resuming revenue growth in 2016 for its generic drugs and branded pharmaceuticals.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We also believe that the company will be able to find new drugs to offset the impact of Copaxone going off patent in September 2015 and that the market is underestimating Copaxone's resilience after it goes off patent.</span>We base our belief on Teva converting 63% of its Copaxone patient base from the 20mg/day to the 40mg/three times per week, which exceeded its expectations for 50% by the end of 2014.Furthermore, it isn't easy to make a generic replication of Copaxone.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Finally, we believe that the company will be more prudent about acquisitions and devote more cash to dividends and share repurchases.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Even though TEVA's amortization of intangibles is a non-cash expense, we did not include it as a benefit to the company's stock price in the interest of being conservative and because we view acquisitions as a capex substitute.</span>Failure of investment community to recognize TEVA's competitive advantages, resulting in a stagnant or declining price/earnings ratio.Increased regulatory controls over the business that end up increasing costs of operations and or reducing revenue (profit margins) per unit sales.Failure to develop and commercialize new products and competition from biosimilars.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Production quality risks (potential product recalls, regulatory action taken against the firm and shortages of key product inputs).</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Competitive legal risks stemming from potential intellectual property infringement or if firms try to pirate TEVA's products.</span>Management and board related (governance) issues, increased turnover of key staff.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Currency fluctuations may result in a gain or drag upon conversion to US Dollars.</span>The EuroZone debt crisis providing headwinds to growth, particularly in heavily indebted markets like Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In conclusion, we believe investors should accumulate shares of TEVA, and accelerate their purchases if TEVA's share price dips below $55/share.</span>TEVA is undervalued relative to its generic and branded pharmaceutical peers and it is making progress towards reducing its cost base.This will enable TEVA to reward its shareholders with 12% annual dividend growth and to repurchase 20 Million shares annually over the next five years based on our forecasts.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We also believe that TEVA's Copaxone product franchise is more resilient than many in the analyst community have feared, which probably explains why analysts have been steadily raising their 2015 and 2016 EPS estimates for TEVA.</span>We were also pleased to see that Teva launched generic versions of Celebrex, Nexium and Diovan and its oncology drug Treanda is now in a new and easier to use liquid formulation, which should help Treanda resume its solid growth volumes.We will be following up this report by comparing TEVA against Actavis and Zoetis (ZOE) in order to reinforce our long TEVA thesis.Source: Teva Is The Drug Industry's Comeback Story
