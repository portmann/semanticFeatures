Carey Inc.'s Q4 Conference Call - W.P. Carey, Inc. (NYSE:WPC) | Seeking Alpha Strength came from its owned portfolio and its managed asset business.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>W.P. Cary Inc (NYSE: WPC ) has always been a little different.</span>As an example, it was a publicly traded partnership before converting to a real estate investment trust, or REIT.At this point, however, the company's diversity is what makes it stand out, for better and potentially worse, from the pack.A fact that was on clear display in 2014.According to CFO Katy Rice , "For the 2014 full-year, we generated AFFO of $4.81 per diluted share, up 14% from $4.22 for the 2013 full-year..." That was largely because of a large acquisition of a non-traded REIT called CPA 16.That said, CEO Trevor Bond explained that, "...we are maintaining our prior guidance for 2015 AFFO, which we continue to expect to fall between $4.76 and $5.02 per diluted share."In other words, it was a good year and if things work out, 2015 will be good, too.In fact, the company increased its dividend for the 55th consecutive quarter in the last stanza of 2014.According to Bond, "Compared to the regular quarterly dividend we declared in the 2013 fourth quarter, it represented a 9.2% increase..." Not bad!<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Carey appears to be doing well right now and rewarding shareholders for their investment.</span>That's excellent news, but nothing to write home about -- it's just the continuation of a long trend.For example, 55 consecutive quarterly increases means over a decade worth of regular hikes.That includes during the 2007 to 2009 recession when many large REITs cut their disbursements.So, yes, a key takeaway from W.P. Carey's quarterly call is that everything is going well.But the really interesting things happen underneath the big numbers.The first thing investors need to get from the quarterly call is that Carey isn't your typical triple net lease REIT.Two transactions highlight this.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>According to the CEO, "The largest acquisition we completed during the fourth quarter was [an] approximately $380 million sale-leaseback transaction with the State of Andalusia in Spain for a portfolio of 70 office properties."</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And, "Turning now to 2015, we have completed two acquisitions so far this year, including [an] approximately $350 million acquisition of a portfolio of 73 automotive retail sites net leased to Pendragon, which is the UK's largest automotive retailer."</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>These two deals point out the biggest difference between Carey and most of its publicly traded triple net lease peers -- Carey goes overseas.</span>Although Carey still gets the bulk of its rents from domestic tenants, about 35% comes from countries around the world.This provides the REIT with both more diversification and more avenues for profitable growth.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For example, when discussing the Spanish acquisition, CEO Bond noted, "This transaction provided the opportunity to acquire a significant portfolio of assets that what we believe was [at] a bulk discount rather than the more typical premium prevalent in the United States."</span>He made similar comments about the U.K. purchase.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In plain English: management has been able to find a better deals outside the United States and is taking advantage of the opportunities, which are only possible because of Carey's global focus.</span>That said, there are negatives to going abroad.For example, the low end of the company's AFFO guidance is actually below 2014 results.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A part of that is attributable to currency changes that could trim AFFO.</span>According to CFO Rice, currency changes between the third and fourth quarter, "...reduced our fourth quarter AFFO by about $0.02 per diluted share."<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So if currencies move against Carey, it could push AFFO toward the low end of 2015 guidance in the coming year.</span>However, that's an issue of taking some bad with the good.If you want global diversification, you kind of have to go along for the currency ride.And, over time, the impact of currency changes tends to be a wash anyway.So investors should take two things away from this.First, Carey is globally diversified.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Second, over the near term, that could hamper results a little even though it should be viewed as a long-term positive.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But that's not the only important difference between Carey and most of its competitors.</span>The third big takeaway from 2014 results is that the company's non-traded REIT business is doing well.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>According to Bond, "Fourth quarter inflows brought total inflows for the managed REITs to approximately $1.5 billion for 2014, which was a record for a full-year period and which demonstrates the continued strong appetite for W. P. Carey products with income oriented retail investors and the strength of the W.P. Carey brand."</span>About 20% of Carey's business comes from this segment, so it's material.And with REIT assets in high demand, this is a nice additional avenue for growth.Although the non-traded REITs Carey sets up own the properties in this segment, Carey gets paid a fee to manage the portfolios.So it puts up little to no capital and gets paid management fees.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That's a nice little side business, since Carey is already taking care of properties and looking at lots of deals that it could push over to this side of the business if they don't fit in the owned portfolio.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>(Size of a property, type of asset, location, and available funds in Carey's owned portfolio are all issues that could lead a property to be placed in a non-traded REIT.)</span>And it can set up more growth in Carey's owned portfolio.For example, the large acquisition that spurred AFFO growth was a non-traded REIT called CPA 16.That's a REIT set up and managed by Carey.On the one hand it lost the management fees associated with those assets when it acquired CPA 16, which reduces revenue a bit.But that lost revenue was more than offset by the fact that it expanded its rent roll and portfolio.And it already knew the assets because it had been managing them for CPA 16.With a couple of similar non-traded REITs either wrapping up or coming close to it, this business should continue to shine in 2015.However, there's a dark side to this diversion from the norm.Non-traded REITs are popular right now because of low interest rates and a huge appetite for income-producing investments.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Should these securities fall out of favor, Carey could quickly find this segment's performance drops off.</span>The assets it has under management won't go away, but it will be harder, and likely more expensive, to get new assets to expand here.I'm not saying that will happen in 2015, but publicly traded REITs are expensive today.If investors get spooked out of public REITs, expect Carey's non-traded business to slow down, too.All in, however, this business has long been a positive for the company.So I would think of it as a valuable diversification from the core and not a long-term liability even if it hits a rough patch.As it stands, Carey is doing well right now and offers investors worthwhile diversification when compared to industry competitors.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>There are risks inherent with that diversification, but that just helps explain why Carey, despite a long history of regular dividend hikes, yields 5.7% when other players in the space like Realty Income (NYSE: O ) and National Retail Properties (NYSE: NNN ) yield around 4.6% and 4.3%, respectively.</span>If you had to buy a triple net lease REIT today, I'd say W.P. Carey should be on your short list, and the company's fourth quarter call is filled with reasons why.Source: 3 Key Takeaways From W.P.
