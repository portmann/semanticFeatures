Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President Thanks, Kelly.Good morning, everyone.Let me begin by providing you with an overview of our prepared remarks for today's call.I'll begin with a review of the fourth quarter and the full-year results for 2014, then Doug Ewert will provide you with operational color on those results as well as an overview of our near-term outlook and opportunities.Then I'll get back into the financial aspects of the forward-looking guidance that we are providing, and then finally, Doug will wrap up our prepared remarks and open the call for questions.Before I start with the results, I'd like to make sure everyone knows that I will be discussing adjusted numbers today, which eliminate one-time costs related to the acquisition and other one-time items.The press release that we issued last night has the GAAP results and the reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted results.And of course, we'll be filing our Form 10-K in a few weeks.Also, I'd like to clarify that when we refer to legacy businesses, we're referring to the total company excluding Jos. A. Bank.Now, let me get into the fourth quarter results.We had total sales in the quarter of $928 million versus $560 million last year.Of this $368 million increase, $337 million came from Jos. A. Bank, which was not part of the company in the fourth quarter last year.For our legacy businesses, we had a $31 million or 5.5% increase in Q4 sales.This was driven by strong comp sales growth in every retail division, plus some store growth in our Men's Wearhouse brand.Comparable sales growth by division were 6.8% at Men's Wearhouse, and this was driven by higher average tickets and higher transactions.We had 8.6% at Moores, and this was driven by higher average tickets offset by a slight decrease in traffic.K&G came in at 6.8%, which was all driven by higher traffic.And our corporate apparel business had a very small decrease in sales for the quarter due to shifts in mix and timing.At Jos. A. Bank, we saw a negative 6.6% comp sales decline for the quarter.This was better than expected.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The decline resulted from a decrease in average ticket and a reduction in the number of transactions, but we believe we mitigated further declines by taking some additional seasonal markdowns.</span>So, overall, we're very pleased with the top line performance for the quarter.We're also pleased with gross margins, especially in our legacy businesses, which were all ahead of last year, except for corporate apparel.Legacy gross margin rate was up even before the impact of leverage on our occupancy cost.So, our strong top line results came without eroding our gross margin rate.For Jos. A. Bank, we had a decrease in our gross margin rate.And as I just mentioned, this was due to some additional markdowns we took to help clear seasonal product and reduce carryover.For advertising, we spent $59.2 million in the quarter or 6.4% of sales.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For the legacy businesses, we spent approximately the same amount as last year and achieved slight leverage on the higher sales.</span>Other SG&A which excludes advertising was $279 million for the quarter with 30% of sales.Last year, the SG&A ran at about 37% of sales.This decrease in SG&A rate is primarily due to the addition of Jos. A. Bank, but legacy businesses continued to control expenses well.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You may recall that we made some strategic expense cuts in our legacy businesses at the beginning of 2014.</span>And these cuts continued to provide SG&A leverage throughout the fourth quarter.We also benefited from synergies in the fourth quarter.We estimated that the amount of synergy savings that was realized in the quarter was about $7 million.That brings us to EBIT, which was $24.9 million for the quarter.Our net interest expense was $26.5 million.We had net after tax loss for the quarter of $1.3 million, which was translated into an EPS number of a negative $0.03.So Q4 was a strong quarter for us and it keeps us easily on track for our longer term earnings goals, which we'll speak more about later on this call.Now, I'll move on to results for 2014 for the full year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Total sales for the year were approximately $3.3 billion, of which $684 million came from the partial year results from Jos. A. Bank.</span>Our legacy businesses had total sales growth of 3.9%, again driven by strong comps across the board.For the year, Men's Wearhouse had comps of 3.9%, Moores had 8.6%, K&G had 3.7% and we also benefited from a $10.6 million increase in sales at our corporate apparel group.So we saw strength in all of these businesses.Jos. A. Bank on a full year basis had a comp sales decline of 2.5%.While we only owned the business for a little more than half the year, we set our long-term goals against the baseline for 2013.So it was important for us to track the full year change in sales.This full year decline is well within the range of outcomes that we had expected.So even in these early days of the merger and transition, we are on track with our internal plans for sales.So now onto gross margins.We're pleased to report that our legacy retail gross margins improved year-over-year by more than 40 basis points.So, as I said about the fourth quarter, we were able to drive solid top line results, while also improving gross margin rates.The gross margin rate for the entire company is down from the prior year.And this is due to the addition of the Jos. A. Bank business, which is currently running with gross margins that are below the average for our legacy businesses.On a full year-on-year basis, the Jos. A. Bank retail clothing gross margin rate was more than 500 basis points below our Men's Wearhouse brand, and this is part of the opportunity we see for the future.So we're pleased with our legacy margins and we see a lot of opportunity for the Jos. A. Bank margins.Advertising cost for the year were $168 million or 5.2% of sales.Other SG&A was $976 million or 30% of sales.And these amounts came in near plan.Our operating profits or EBIT came in at $257.6 million or 7.9% of sales.This EBIT margin is over 100 basis points better than the legacy businesses EBIT margin from the prior year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This improvement was driven almost entirely by the performance of our legacy businesses, which had year-on-year EBIT growth of more than 20%.</span>After interest and taxes, we ended 2014 with $124.8 million in net earnings or $2.58 a share.We're proud of these earnings results.We continue to feel confident in this team's ability to plan and execute toward our 2017 goals.Now, a few comments about our balance sheet.We ended the year with cash at $62 million and no outstanding draws on our revolving credit facility.Our total gross debt remains just below $1.7 billion, inventory ended at $938 million, which is obviously higher than last year due to the addition of Jos. A. Bank.Inventory by business was as follows.Men's Wearhouse and Moores have slightly higher per store inventory, primarily due to the shift to higher-priced Joseph Abboud product, K&G's per-store inventory is slightly lower than last year, and Jos. A. Bank's per-store inventory is also lower.There were no other key changes related to our balance sheet during the quarter.Now before turning the call over to Doug, I just want to mention a couple other notable items from the quarter.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>During the quarter, we entered into an interest rate hedge to convert a portion of the term loan from a variable LIBOR-based rate to a fixed rate.</span>Under the terms of this loan, we paid LIBOR plus 3.5% with a 1% floor on LIBOR.Then on January 6, we entered into a swap agreement that became effective on February 2.The starting notional amount of this swap is $520 million, and that notional amount will decline over 14 quarters.The new effective rate on this portion of our term loan is now 1.53% plus the spread of 3.5%.So our rate will increase on this portion of the loan by 53 basis points given the current LIBOR.As an update on synergies, we continue to make strong progress on our merger integration and cost savings.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We ended the year with approximately $35 million in run rate synergies that have already been implemented and achieved.</span>This is compared to our original estimate of $15 million by the end of 2014, so we remain very confident in our integration plans.Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug Ewert, our CEO.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you, Jon.With my prepared remarks this morning, I'll share with you the specific reasons why we're seeing strength in our legacy businesses; update you on the Jos. A. Bank integration, which is going very well; explain why we have always viewed 2015 as a transitional year for Jos. A. Bank, provide more guidance on what we expect in 2015, and increase our 2017 guidance to include K&G.Our legacy retail brands of Men's Wearhouse, Moores and K&G are each benefiting from a focus on trend-right products, exclusive brands, and best-in-class service.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We're seeing healthy growth in each of the brands in both comp store sales and gross margin, and we believe there are even more opportunities for growth ahead.</span>There is particular strength in the dress categories, including suits, furnishings, shoes and accessories.There are a number of factors at play here, including robust consumer acceptance of slimmer-fitting clothing, the enthusiastic response to our Joseph Abboud product from a more aspirational customer, the attitudes towards dressing well from our millennial-age customers and continued improvements in the macroeconomic and employment conditions.While we're still in the early stages of realizing the enormous opportunities of the Joseph Abboud acquisition, we're excited by the early customer response.With the encouragement of our expert sales force, many existing customers are trading up to the higher quality and price points.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And evidence suggests that even with minimal marketing today, new customers are responding to our commercial that features Joseph and shopping with us for the first time.</span>The all-store rollout was completed during the fourth quarter last year.And even with a partial year, we achieved $230 million in brand revenue.Going forward, we expect to grow a sizeable business in custom clothing.For only $100 more than an off-the-rack suit, we can offer a customer a high-quality designer suit made in our U.S. factory with over 150 fabric choices tailored to his specific measurements, customized with the features that customers want, and delivered in three weeks.Joseph Abboud custom clothing is available in all Men's Wearhouse stores and is being introduced in all Moores stores this month.Beyond tailored clothing, we see an opportunity to grow a custom dress shirt business, and we will be introducing Joseph Abboud custom dress shirts in all Men's Wearhouse and Moores stores later this year.We'll also be extending the Abboud brand into all Jos. A. Bank stores, which is a natural place for the existing customer and the updated traditional looks will be helpful in attracting new customers.To further develop and support the brand, we'll be opening a Joseph Abboud flagship store on the corner of 49th and Madison Avenue in the next two weeks.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We see this as an important step in furthering the brand exposure and to develop potential growth with our current and future international licensing partners.</span>The Men's Wearhouse formal wear business in 2014 was robust as we achieved a 6.4% comp store increase.Growth is coming from both transactions and average price as customers resonate with our high quality, exclusive brands like Vera Wang and Joseph Abboud.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This year we're strengthening our offerings with new exclusive designer styles and supporting it with a new Vera Wang TV campaign, in which Vera appears in the commercial.</span>The new commercial begins airing next week.We acquired the Jos. A. Bank business because we saw a tremendous opportunity to capture an exclusive brand that has a loyal customer and to further consolidate market share with a customer that we were not able to attract to Men's Wearhouse.We also saw opportunities to improve the business in merchandising, marketing and customer engagement.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We knew Jos. A. Bank had a reputation for quality clothing, but believe it had suffered under the effects of aggressive promotional activity.</span>Evolving away from this excessive promotional activity is a current challenge and an opportunity.We also knew there would be considerable efficiencies achieved by bringing two large and similar companies together into one shared services organization.We're now only nine months into the integration and our knowledge of the Jos. A. Bank business is much greater, our grasp of the opportunities is much clearer and our enthusiasm for the brand is even stronger than what it was on the date of the acquisition.And while the Jos. A. Bank comp sales were down 6.6% during the fourth quarter as we lapped aggressive promotional activity from the previous year, these results do not dampen our expectations of the revenue-generating and cost-saving synergies that will be available to the combined company.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While much of the back-office systems have already been updated and integrated, we did not risk disrupting the critical fourth quarter with the more significant systems conversions.</span>During 2015, we will be updating and changing critical and customer-facing systems, including merchandising, website, and point-of-sale systems.This spring, we'll be relocating key talent and consolidating back-office functions into our shared services structure.During the third quarter, we'll convert the POS system, which will unlock tools and training for our customer-facing employees, as well as enable the introduction of a customer loyalty program.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We anticipate systems conversion will be complete by the end of the third quarter.</span>The total synergies from the combined company will be at least $150 million, and we've made a strong start with a $35 million run rate synergies achieved so far as compared to our original estimate of $15 million by the end of 2014.We remain confident that revenue synergies are significant, achievable and will begin to emerge in the back half of 2015.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>However, giving specific estimates around each of these opportunities is not possible at this time.</span>But I can share some color with you on the opportunities and give you a sense of the expected timing.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>After studying the selling history and soliciting feedback from Jos. A. Bank customers and our stores, we validated our assumptions that there are significant opportunities to update and improve the assortments.</span>As a general theme, there are too many styles that have not had an update to the fit or styling for a long time.There's been too much basic inventory carried in each store because the systems were too inadequate to efficiently replenish a size-intensive business.Even seasonal fashion product was put through a pack-and-hold process and repeated year-after-year.Taken in total, the slow inventory turns and lack of freshness, once cured, will result in revenue synergies.The Jos. A. Bank customer is loyal and has been responding well to the small amount of newness that they've seen.Starting this spring, we'll begin balancing the assortments with more of the best-selling tailored and slim-fits and less of the slow-selling traditional fit.We'll increase the assortment of plain-front pants and decrease pleated pants.We'll add more big & tall product by extending the sizes offered across all levels of quality.And we'll introduce an expanded assortment of shoes, included updated styling and extended sizes.This spring we'll also be introducing the Joseph Abboud brand into the Jos. A. Bank stores.The Joseph Abboud brand DNA targets the modern traditional customer with superior fabrics, high-quality construction, and timeless style.The Joseph Abboud collection, including tailored clothing made in our U.S. factory, and custom clothing will resonate with many of our existing and prospective Jos. A. Bank customers.Joseph Abboud shoes will arrive in all stores this spring, and we'll begin introducing tailored clothing in select stores this summer.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We anticipate it will take a year to complete the tailored clothing rollout.</span>This fall, the assortments will take a major leap forward as we introduce in the Jos. A. Bank stores new styles in every product category, including updated fashion and seasonal basics, a new collection targeting a younger traditional customer, further expansion of Joseph Abboud, and custom-tailored clothing and dress shirts.Tuxedo rental is another opportunity in Jos. A. Bank, and was relaunched in all stores on January 1.We're now offering our customers our full rental assortment, including exclusive designer styles and color-matched accessories with our partner David's Bridal.We've completed extensive training on how to provide wedding consulting to our formalwear customers and how to leverage our proprietary wedding group management system to ensure a coordinated and problem-free event.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While we watch carefully to make certain that we're not just trading wedding customers from Men's Wearhouse to Jos. A. Bank, we strongly believe that significant incremental tuxedo business will benefit each Jos. A. Bank store.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The high-touch tuxedo rental business took years to perfect at Men's Wearhouse, and we believe the improved systems, training, and cultural changes will make this business blossom at Jos. A. Bank.</span>There is obvious opportunity to improve the Jos. A. Bank brand perception and awareness while creating a more sustainable promotional model and by establishing a new value proposition on the products we sell.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>While it would be difficult and risky to do all at once, we will be introducing new pricing and value propositions over time and as new products are introduced.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>To give you a sense of the timing, we anticipate introducing new pricing on about 25% of the assortment this spring, increasing to about 50% in the back half of the year.</span>Marketing is a broader opportunity, beyond just changing the promotional cadence.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In recent years, the Jos. A. Bank messaging has been almost exclusively focused on deep quantity discounts, deployed with a high frequency and low reach media buy.</span>We see opportunity to broaden the messaging and the audience reach to stimulate both customer retention and acquisition.And to further customer retention and reward our loyal customers, we'll introduce a Jos. A. Bank customer loyalty program later this year.We're moving quickly and carefully, being mindful that we have a loyal customer who likes the quality of the Jos. A. Bank products, while we introduce changes that will improve the customer experience and overall satisfaction with our products and services.While much has been completed in the first nine months, there is much more to do.2015 will be a transitional year for Jos. A. Bank.We do not expect a jump in profitability in the Jos. A. Bank business this year for a few reasons.We'll carry duplicative costs through much of the year until systems conversion allows consolidation.We expect Jos. A. Bank comp sales to continue negative in the first half of the year with improvement in the back half as revenue synergies gain traction and we lap easier comps.We expect comp sales to be down low-single digit on the year.We expect Jos. A. Bank product margin will follow a similar pattern with expansion weighted in the back half of the year as product costing efficiencies flow through.We expect product margin will be up on the year.And now, with that, I'll hand it off to Jon for additional discussion about guidance.Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President Thanks, Doug.We have reiterated several times over the past several months that we remain confident in our 2017 EPS guidance that was provided last July.And all of our comments today should be interpreted as consistent with that view.Initially, after the merger, we decided not to give near-term EPS guidance because we wanted investors to focus like we do on the medium-term goals for 2017.In the meantime, we've tried to provide as much information as we can to allow investors to understand how we are doing.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Over the past few months, we've come to believe that many investors and analysts have not received enough information to properly model our CorpusPath from the acquisition date to 2017.</span>While we continue to feel confident that we're on track for these 2017 targets, our results are being compared to Wall Street consensus numbers that are not based on near-term earnings guidance from the company.So, we're adding a few elements to our guidance efforts.First, we are updating our 2017 guidance range to include our K&G business.By 2017, we expect this business to add about $0.25 to our EPS, and this was reflected in last night's press release.Second, we've provided a set of quarterly baseline numbers for 2014.These were also in the press release.While we stopped the 2014 baseline presentation at operating earnings, we also disclosed in the guidance section of the press release that the baseline EPS for 2014 was $2.37.These baseline P&Ls and the baseline EPS number for the combined business will help investors with year-on-year comparisons as we discuss our 2015 EPS guidance and as we post actual results during the year.And third, we're providing an estimated range of EPS for 2015.We're estimating adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.90.Compared to the baseline EPS that I just mentioned, this would represent an EPS growth rate in the range of 14% to 22%.And I should point out that we baked into these estimates a negative impact from currency translation of about $0.07.So, while this range is below the latest Wall Street consensus numbers that we have seen, it is a strong growth rate during a time of transition and integration, and it is in line with the internal models that we have been using.We have always modeled the CorpusPath to 2017 as more parabolic than straight line.As Doug has described, we expect the top line at Jos. A. Bank to continue to decline for the first half of 2015, and we do not expect to be able to make meaningful improvements in gross margin, while we are installing systems and transitioning the business.We expect to see improvements in the back-half of 2015, and we'll be positioned for top line growth and gross margin growth in 2016 and 2017.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The growth in those out-years is not based on heroic assumptions.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We simply assume that our legacy business can maintain modest growth and that the Jos. A. Bank business can get back on a growth CorpusPath after what will have been several years of negative comps and after we have updated much of the Jos. A. Bank business.</span>I'd like to make a couple more comments relating to the forward guidance.We previously mentioned that we ended 2014 with a run rate synergy at $35 million, which is about $20 million ahead of the original schedule we had provided.We can now provide a little more clarity on how synergies will affect 2015.We estimate that the realized synergy benefit in 2015 will be between $50 million and $55 million.The first quarter will likely see the benefits from our existing run rate synergies, and then as we add more synergies throughout the year, the quarterly realized benefit will grow.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We expect to end 2015 with run rate synergies of between $70 million and $75 million, but again, to make it simple, investors can assume that we will realize $50 million to $55 million for this fiscal year.</span>Next, regarding our debt repayment, we have not yet provided guidance.We can now estimate that we will repay at least $75 million in the second half of this year.As previously discussed, we expect to use cash in the first half of 2015 for additional integration cost.Then beginning in the second half, we'll begin to utilize excess cash to repay our term loan.Then cash flow and debt reduction will accelerate significantly in 2016 and 2017.So, those are the additional elements of guidance that we can provide at this time, and now I'll turn the call back over to Doug.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director As I indicated at the beginning of my prepared remarks, we remain confident in our 2017 guidance, and we never expected a straight line pattern when we provided our initial guidance.The first 18 months were always focused on integration, testing, and synergy achievement, followed by reasonable growth.We expect profits to accelerate in 2016 as sales and margin at Jos. A. Bank start to rebound after three consecutive negative years, higher levels of both cost and revenue synergy take effect, and the legacy businesses continue to grow with at least modest and achievable growth.Hopefully, what you've heard from us today is enthusiasm for the strength of our legacy brands, confidence in the integration and synergy opportunities with Jos. A. Bank, our perspective on the outlook for 2015, and an increase in our 2017 guidance to include K&G.We hope you found our comments helpful in understanding the opportunities from investing in our company.Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.Our first question comes from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs.Please go ahead with your questions.Hi.Good morning.Can you talk more about just the nature of the duplicative costs that you're going to be incurring during this transition year?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It looks like – just doing the math on your press release, looks like in the fourth quarter that might have happened as well.</span>I'm just trying to back into SG&A at Jos. A. Bank.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>It looks like you might have run up about 40% or so.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If you could just clarify that and maybe address more about the nature of the guidance versus consensus and if the duplicative costs are a big source of that difference.</span>Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President Hi, Taposh.It's not a big source.In 2015, there are certain back-office operations where we have laid out a plan to move into one operation, but due to system constraints, we have to maintain two sets of people for part of the year.It's in the millions of dollars, but it's not a major part of the reason that 2015 EPS is below where Wall Street was.It's just a minor part of that.And as of 2014, I'm not sure that I see what you see.I think that Jos. A. Bank costs should be coming down.And it's very misleading at this point for us to look at the costs by division, because as we migrate, we basically, for now, move all costs on to The Men's Wearhouse brand.So it makes The Men's Wearhouse or the legacy businesses look like they have too much expense, and it makes the Jos. A. Bank division look like it has too little.So, it's very difficult to break it down at that level.Got it.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If I could just ask a couple of factual questions, along the lines of narrowing the spread of merch margins between the two banners, can you give us some insight into what the average out-the-door suit price is of the two concepts?</span>Where you think that gap should be in a couple of years?That's one.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then two, if you can just tell us what your assumptions are for interest expense and tax rate for 2015.</span>Thanks.Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President I'll start with the margin opportunity and the average suit price.Men's Wearhouse average out-the-door prices of suits today is operating in the range of about $290 a suit.The average out-the-door price of a suit at Jos. A. Bank last year was about $225.We see opportunity to recover that average out-the-door retail price of the suits at Jos. A. Bank.They were historically at higher levels.And we think we're going to be able to achieve that through adjustments to the mix like, for example, bringing in the higher-quality, higher-priced Joseph Abboud product into Jos. A. Bank.Kelly M. Dilts - Senior Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations And as far as the tax rate and the interest for fiscal year 2015, we're looking at 34.8% for the tax rate and about $105 million for interest expense.Thank you.And our next question comes from the line of Eddie Plank with Jefferies.Please go ahead with your questions.Hey.Good morning, guys.Thanks for all the color.It's really helpful.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I guess, like during the quarter, if you could just talk about when you started to see the Jos. A. Bank sales improve relative to where they began the quarter and were those drivers mostly just from the increased promotions you did?</span>And then as a quick follow-up, do you think introducing the Joseph Abboud product in Jos. A. Bank stores will cannibalize any of those sales at Men's Wearhouse or how are you thinking about that at this point?Thanks.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you, Eddie.At Jos. A. Bank, we had a relatively strong December relative to November.So, we made the decision to take some additional markdowns to clear some seasonal product and reduce the amount of seasonal carryover that we would normally experience.So, we did step on the gas a little bit and saw the benefit of that mostly in December during the quarter.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>As far as Joseph Abboud goes, I don't expect it to cannibalize Men's Wearhouse because we see a different customer shopping at Jos. A. Bank than we do at Joseph Abboud.</span>Obviously, from a customer acquisition standpoint, both chains will try to compete for growth, and I think that's a healthy competition and good for business and will give us 600 more stores of opportunity to attract customers to the great value that we see in the Joseph Abboud brand.Great.Thanks, guys.Good luck going forward.Thank you.And our next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe with Stifel.Please proceed with your questions.Richard E. Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Thanks very much, and just to follow on with the questioning about Joseph Abboud in the Jos. A. Bank stores.Is there a joint marketing opportunity either for tuxedos this spring with Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank's both offering the same assortment of tuxedos?And then later when they both offer the Joseph Abboud product, will you try and use marketing or TV with Joseph Abboud to market to both the legacy and the Jos. A. Bank's brand?Thank you.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Yes.There's a lot of Josephs.Thank you, Richard.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We are testing joint marketing now on a small scale.We can do it on a regional basis, but we are going to ease our way into linking the two brands side by side until we understand better how the customer is going to respond, but we're certainly testing around that in tux.As far as the Joseph Abboud marketing, we're currently tagging the advertising for Men's Wearhouse because Men's Wearhouse is the only place the product's available at the moment.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Once it expands into Jos. A. Bank, I think you'll see us probably elevate the advertising to not target a specific brand and be targeted more just to promoting the overall Joseph Abboud brand, and we'll also have the free-standing Joseph Abboud store at that point.</span>Our next question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice.Please go ahead with your questions.David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co.LLC Yes.Thank you.Good morning and thanks for all the detail.In terms of 2015 at the core businesses, can you give us a sense given all the momentum you had in the fourth quarter, how should we think about what's implicit in your guidance for those legacy divisions?Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President Well, it's Jon, David.The legacy businesses continue to do well.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So, we've assumed ongoing growth at modest-to-not-heroic levels, and the bulk of the earnings increase in 2015 is coming from legacy, because as Doug said, the Jos. A. Bank business is expected to have negative comps, and even with some margin expansion that's not where the growth is coming from.</span>This is the transition year for Jos. A. Bank, so most of the growth will come from legacy.David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co.LLC Okay.And then as a follow-up, just in terms of the first quarter.A lot of other retailers have talked about the weather in February and port delays having an impact on their business.Can you give a sense on how the first quarter has gone thus far for you?And when we think about first quarter EBIT relative to the baseline you gave, should it necessarily be up or down?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Any kind of direction there could be helpful.</span>Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well I can tell you from a port disruption standpoint, we've done a pretty good job maneuvering around it.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We've been able to bring a lot of goods directly into the Port of Houston, and we've aired some goods in where we needed to, and we've had a minimal amount of goods disrupted by the slowdown out of the port and we don't anticipate any meaningful disruption to our business because of the port.</span>As far as weather goes, it's becoming pretty customary at this time of year to have weather disruptions, store closures when the storms are pretty intense, and we saw a fair amount of that last year and we saw a fair amount of that this year.And that really shifts around the volume in Q1 quite dramatically.But there's nothing surprising that we're seeing in our results to-date for October – I mean for Q1.David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co.LLC And then a comment – any kind of color about the EBIT comparison?Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President No, I don't think we have any color on that.I think we're just sticking with the annual guidance.Betty Chen - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.Thanks.Good morning.Congrats on a nice quarter.I was wondering, Doug, I think you mentioned, which was really helpful, the amount of goods that will be affected by pricing spring versus the back half.Is that also relevant for some of the product adjustments, or will product adjustments really occur in the back half and pick up more momentum in 2016?And my second question is just so we're clear in understanding the synergies, Jon, when you say that we're going to be realizing $55 million this year, does that mean that will actually flow through in terms of SG&A, or we should be really using the $35 million number in terms of how that helps SG&A for the year?Thanks.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director All right.Let me take the first part of that.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We're going to be adjusting the value proposition that we offer to the customer in kind of a running change to minimize the risk to the business as opposed to trying a big-bang resetting of the value equation across the entire network.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So, we're going to be repricing some of the existing goods and primarily introducing new goods that will have a different value equation.</span>So, you're going to see a mix of both happen that contribute to that growth from 25% this spring to about half of the goods by the end of fall.Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President And as to synergies, the $50 million to $55 million is the amount that we expect to actually benefit the P&L this year.So, SG&A should be reduced this year by that $50 million to $55 million.Betty Chen - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.Okay.That was really helpful.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And then, lastly, could I just ask about K&G?</span>So, certainly, it sounds like Q4 was a really strong quarter for the brand.You've increased the out year (39:41) EPS because of K&G.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Can you share with us a little bit more about where the margin opportunity is for that division versus where you might see it longer term and any other product color you're seeing in that segment?</span>Thanks.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Sure.We're seeing tremendous success in the K&G business by offering really compelling value on products that can be found at much higher prices in the marketplace with recognizable designer brands, as well as some very successful businesses under exclusive brand.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We're also having a tremendous amount of success with unusually compelling value like bundling together shirts, cufflinks, pocket silks into a compelling package price all coordinated.</span>And we're seeing tremendous success with activities like that at K&G.We also see opportunities to continue to improve our cost structure.We'll be rationalizing a few more stores in the next few years at K&G and unlocking some cost savings opportunities in the supply chain that we see.And without any heroics, we see improving the bottom-line results at K&G pretty dramatically over the next three years.Betty Chen - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.Great.Thanks so much.Best of luck.Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen.Please go ahead with your questions.John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC Hey.Good morning, everyone.Can you help us understand the magnitude of potential product margin increases at Jos. A. Bank's that you talked about in the back half of 2015, and then where you think the Jos. A. Bank's operating margin needs to get to for you to get to your 2017 targets?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, we're not going to guide specifically on the magnitude of the margin impact just because there's so many moving parts and variables in there, and it really is contingent upon customer response to all of it.</span>So, we're pretty confident that we're going to run an increase in margin.It's harder to bracket for you at this point in the game the magnitude of that.John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay.And the $50 million to $55 million in SG&A reductions, from a quarterly cadence standpoint, is that more weighted towards the back half of the year?Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President It is because we started the year with the $35 million run rate.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So, I think you could assume that a quarter of $35 million is what we benefit in Q1.</span>And then throughout each quarter, we'll be adding to end the year at, say, $70 million to $75 million in run rate.So, it should grow each quarter and come out to a total of $50 million to $55 million.John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay.And then just on debt pay down and the cadence through this year, you're expecting to pay... Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President It'll be late.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Earlier, we answered a question about what the interest expense we expected is, and we said $105 million; embedded in that $105 million assumption is a $75 million debt pay down very late in the year, after Christmas.</span>Our next question comes from the line of William Reuter with Bank of America.Please go ahead with your questions.Janani Ganta - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi.This is actually Janani on for Bill today.My first question is would you be able to provide a fiscal year 2015 CapEx number?Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President We have previously guided that we expect CapEx to be between $120 million and $130 million.And we have a fair amount of control on that number, so you can expect that we will be in that range.Janani Ganta - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay.Great.Thanks.And then my follow-up is you mentioned that you've re-launched the tuxedo rental business January 1.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Can you talk about any early trends you might be seeing there and early customer reactions and whether they're positive?</span>Thank you.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We only have a portion of the expected revenue for the year under reservation.It's really too soon to read into those numbers too much.However, we're pretty excited about the opportunities with the new designer styles that we're introducing this spring and the high penetration of these exclusive styles as they are to our total.And then the new Vera TV campaign that kicks in next week.So, there's a lot more to come on tux.It's a little too early to say.Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi.Did you give a store opening or closure plan for the year?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I may have missed it.</span>Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I don't think we did, but on The Men's Wearhouse side, we have stated previously that we intend to get to 750 stores.We ended this past year at 698 stores.So, we will open 20 stores to 30 stores per year for the next two years to get to 750 stores.And then on Jos. A. Bank, this year we'll open another half a dozen stores or so that are – just were in the (45:11) pipeline at the time of the merger.And then at this point, we don't have plans beyond that for the Jos. A. Bank stores.Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay.And then you talked a bit about the ports and costs, but can you just say your overall expectation for sourcing costs for the year, the inflation?And if that change is based on the timing of the convert, the Jos. A. Bank's product in store to your kind of new design, how does that affect the sourcing costs and timing of it?Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, what we're experiencing is a reduction in sourcing costs as we're leveraging the combined spend of the two companies and we expect to start seeing that flow through the business in the back half of the year.When we acquired Jos. A. Bank, essentially spring 2015 was already bought.We were able to change the cuttings to update the fits of what was on order for spring, but we weren't really able to change the content.For fall, we start to leverage the combined spend and unlock some of the costing revenue synergies that are embedded in our overall guidance that are going to come from product costing.And those will start to unlock this fall and then certainly accelerate quite dramatically in 2016 and beyond.Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay, great.And just a follow-up, but the synergies that you're talking about before, those are all SG&A synergies, those weren't the cost side, the $50 million to $55 million?Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President Yeah.For this year, it's mostly cost.There's a little bit of cost of goods in there towards the back half of the year because of the long lead time on the goods and then they have to sell through before we would recognize the synergies.So, there is a small amount within that $50 million to $55 million, but it's not big yet.2016 is when we start to get the bigger benefit.Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital Management LP Hi.Great quarter.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes just talking about Joseph Abboud where it just seems – now that you have the whole thing, you're opening the store in a couple of weeks in New York City in Madison Avenue.</span>But what is the strategy for that?Should we see over the next five years a number of standalone stores across the country with flagship stores where you highlight the brand?I mean, is this something that's going to be a new growth leg for the company in a standalone specialty store sense?Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, thanks, Steve.Listen, we're pretty excited about the Joseph Abboud brand.We think the brand has long legs, can grow substantially.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And that growth is going to come from a variety of places.</span>It's going to come organically through The Men's Wearhouse and Moores stores.Now we'll be adding Jos. A. Bank stores to the network, so another 600 stores of distribution.We have a Joseph Abboud website, as you pointed out we're opening the store.Joseph Abboud plays a role in our tuxedo rental business.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>We have some very strong licensees with international exposure.</span>And we see opportunity to grow the licensing business.As far as whether we see a new store rollout concept coming out of Joseph Abboud, we'd be thrilled if the customer response would indicate that that's a big opportunity for us.We obviously haven't even opened the first store yet.So, it's too soon to declare a victory there and a new chain, but that would be lovely to see.Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital Management LP Yeah.And I imagine with that I guess (48:42) we got to get through this consolidation first.Okay.Thanks a lot.Hi, thanks.Just a couple of follow-ups.On the guidance for 2015, Jon, if you can correct me, it looks like your guidance is calling for EBIT to grow about $50 million year-over-year.So, call it to about $330 million-ish for 2015 versus your historic baseline that you provided in the press release, which includes the synergies that you said are going to be $50 million to $55 million.Can you just confirm if we're interpreting that correctly?Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President It sounds like the underlying business ex synergies is going to be flat or down, and I'm just trying to understand why that would be.Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President No, it's not.Again, the legacy businesses are showing nice growth.The synergies are adding to that growth.And the Jos. A. Bank business is pulling away from that.Okay.I'll follow up offline.The other question I had was can you tell us what the legacy Men's Wearhouse EBIT was in the fourth quarter?Jon W. Kimmins - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive Vice President Thank you.This concludes today's question-and-answer session.I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.Douglas Scott Ewert - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you.We hope you found our comments helpful in understanding the strengths of our business and the future opportunities that we're focused on.Thanks for your interest in our company and for your time this morning.We'll talk to you next quarter.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.</span>Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.</span>All other use is prohibited.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT.</span>USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha.com .Thank you!Men's Wearhouse Inc. released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on March 12, 2015.</div></body></html>
