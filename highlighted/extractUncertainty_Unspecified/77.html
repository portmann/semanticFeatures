We should see interest rates on savings be at least 3% and yet.....We should see movies like "50 Shades of shit" bomb at the box office....and yet....Lincoln should have let the southen states secede instead of suppressing their freedom to do so, by killing and maiming and ruining 1.2 million white guys and their families to free 2 millon slaves.2 slaves freed for every white man killed, rendered into vulture meat, and his family made destitute.We should have seen Bill clinton hung up by his balls by NOW, but they rallied berhind him.....the very same women who would have personally hung him up by the testes if he were a republican.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 11:42 | 5881650 Alvin Fernald When one claims someone is 'voted in' or an incumbent 'retains his seat' or there was 'an election' there should be a burden of proof to go with it.Thu, 03/12/2015 - 10:40 | 5881429 Creepy A.
