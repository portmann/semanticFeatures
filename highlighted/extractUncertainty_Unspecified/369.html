11:24 | 5881567 Hitlery_4_Dictator Think about this for a min.First it was brick cell phones, then smaller flip phones, then "smart" phones, "smart" glasses, now smaller "smart" watches, next "smart" implants....that's where it's headed folks And of course the mentally enslved mellinial morons will be the first to line up to be even bigger slaves....Thu, 03/12/2015 -
