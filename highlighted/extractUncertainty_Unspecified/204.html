(NYSE:AA) | Seeking Alpha You cannot accuse the folks at Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) of not understanding their market or of lacking a strategic plan.Investors would always like a better performance, but in the midst of one of the most tumultuous periods in the history of the non-ferrous metals markets, the firm has seen the writing on the wall and positioned itself to take advantage of changes in its marketplace, while minimizing the damage from market turmoil.Alcoa's latest move, as reported earlier in MetalMiner , to acquire Pittsburgh-based RTI International Metals Inc. (NYSE: RTI ) in a $1.5 billion stock-for-stock deal is a logical and sound strategic move, building on the aluminum producer's long-term plan to invest in downstream, value-added activities and gradually move away from the lower-return primary smelting business.Alcoa has invested heavily in new production facilities to meet an inexorable rise in demand for automotive sheet and to capitalize on its position as a major player in the equally buoyant aerospace sector.The purchase of the titanium specialist RTI Metals, with its focus on exactly the same markets but in the complimentary product area, will support Alcoa's existing activities and allow the company to grow its sales book with major automotive and aerospace firms.The WSJ reported that RTI has revenue of around $800 million a year, while its aerospace and defense operations delivered 80% of its revenue in 2014, making parts such as landing gears, engines and airframes.Other markets include medical devices and pipes and tubes for the oil and gas industries.Meanwhile, a report in Reuters this week illustrates Alcoa's continued reduction in its smelting activities.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The firm announced it may reduce up to 14%, or half a million tons, of capacity in the face of weak prices.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Contrary to primary producers' strident assertions that they were not beneficiaries of record physical delivery premiums, Alcoa's continued retrenchment from the primary end of the market as premiums show the first signs of weakness in two years suggests that the company can see the writing on the wall and is getting out whilst it stands a chance of finding a buyer for those plants that may be deemed viable.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If not, it will just close the plants down, the firm says, as Reuters speculates its highest-cost plants in Brazil and Spain will be the first to go.</span>The overall trend, though, should not be seen as a wholesale departure from primary smelting.Alcoa remains the world's second-largest primary producer, and while it has closed capacity in North America and Europe, it has opened substantial new low-cost capacity in the Middle East, taking advantage of low-cost natural gas-based power generation.RTI should bring much more than a bolt-on $800 million of revenue.The firm's expertise in the same industries as Alcoa should strengthen the joint business expertise and strategic partnership with major-end users.Nor is it likely to be the end of Alcoa's migration towards being a business with a more value-add focus.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
