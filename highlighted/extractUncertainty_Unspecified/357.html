Real Time Economics - WSJ Big businesses are gearing up to make the case for overhauling the U.S. tax system, armed with a new study arguing that it is encouraging foreign takeovers of American firms.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The trend could lead to job losses and other harms, according to the study prepared for the Business Roundtable, a group of big-firm CEOs.</span>The findings–to be released as soon as Wednesday–are likely to fuel business demands that Congress rewrite U.S. tax rules.Businesses want Congress to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, now the highest among developed countries at 35%.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>They also want to loosen the U.S. system’s unusual global reach.</span>Those features of the U.S. tax system are putting American firms at a disadvantage compared with their foreign rivals, particularly when it comes to cross-border mergers and acquisitions, businesses have long contended.The study seeks to quantify the problem, while underscoring the potential broader impacts on jobs and workers.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>“If the disadvantages in our system persist, they could have long-lasting effects on productivity, wages and living standards,�?</span>says the report, prepared for the Business Roundtable by accounting firm EY.Still, the extent of the U.S. tax system’s negative impacts on American firms and their competitiveness remains a subject of debate, and the new study leaves some big questions unanswered.The report analyzed more than 25,000 cross-border merger and acquisition deals around the world over the last decade, looking for evidence of the U.S. system’s disadvantages.It found that American firms were the target in 23% of transactions, and the acquirer in 20%.On net, the U.S. lost $179 billion worth of domestic companies through foreign takeovers during the period, in part because of the U.S. corporate tax system, the study says.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>That $179 billion represents the difference between the value of U.S. businesses taken over by foreign firms and the value of foreign firms taken over by U.S. businesses.</span>If instead the U.S. had had a lower corporate tax rate of 25%–in line with the average of other developed countries–American companies would have acquired more foreign firms, the study contends.On net, the U.S. would have acquired $590 billion worth of foreign firms instead of losing $179 billion in domestic companies, the study concludes.The study also finds that many of the foreign takeovers of U.S. targets involved relatively small American companies.Those firms tend to be highly innovative.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Placing them in foreign hands could make them more likely to move technology and research elsewhere, the group says.</span>“Our failed [tax] policies have turned the United States into a net exporter of headquarters, valuable assets and startup technologies,�?Business Roundtable President John Engler said in a statement.Mr. Engler is a former Republican governor of Michigan.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Some experts say the picture is more complicated than the EY study suggests, however, and it is unclear how much disadvantage the U.S. tax system creates for American companies.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For instance, the unusual U.S. tax rules on foreign profits encourage American firms to park those profits offshore, where they can avoid the relatively high U.S. tax rate until they are brought home.</span>One result is that many American firms eventually use that money to buy foreign businesses instead.The U.S. tax system “encourages mergers in both directions,�?said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank that is a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>“In the long-run the U.S. tax system is probably encouraging a situation where more companies than otherwise would be the case [are] foreign based.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But it doesn’t always work that way…and may not always matter that much.</span>?Other economic factors also have likely been at work in encouraging foreign takeovers of U.S. firms.For instance, the EY report shows that some of the largest volumes of foreign takeovers occurred in the years before the U.S. financial system collapsed in 2008.Since then, takeover totals generally have been smaller, even though the U.S. tax system has become increasingly out of line with other developed countries’ over time.Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.Send news items, comments and questions to the editors and reporters below or email  realtimeeconomics@wsj.com .You must enter the verification code below to send.</div></body></html>
