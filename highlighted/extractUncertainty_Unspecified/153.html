Researchâ€™s lead product candidate ARC-520 has tremendous potential.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>ARC-520 could generate peak sales of more than $3 billion.</span>In my previous article on Arrowhead Research (NASDAQ: ARWR ), I had focused on the company's technology platform and its lead product candidate ARC-520.I had noted that ARWR's lead product candidate had the potential to achieve $1 billion in peak sales.This forecast though was based on the performance of Baraclude.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>ARC-520 could in fact achieve peak sales at least three times what I had assumed in the last article.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The peak sales estimate is based on certain assumptions, which I will discuss below.</span>For a complete valuation spreadsheet, see my website here .The important thing though is that based on this sales estimate, the risk-adjusted value of ARC-520 is more than double the current stock price of ARWR.The estimates for the number of people in the U.S. chronically infected with hepatitis B ranges from anywhere between 800,000 and 2 million.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>ARWR itself assumes 2 million patients in the U.S. are chronically infected with HBV.</span>I have taken the mid-point of various estimates i.e. around 1.5 million.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I have assumed a similar number for Western Europe as the rate of prevalence is similar in the U.S. and on the continent.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>According to data from CDC, an additional 5,000-8,000 persons become chronically infected with HBV in the U.S. I have once again taken the mid-point and assumed 6,500 persons become chronically infected with the disease.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>A similar number is assumed for Western Europe.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Based on a treatment rate of 20%, penetration rate of 5% and treatment cost of $100,000, ARC-520 gross sales in the first year could be $1.5 billion.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This sales figure looks easily achievable considering that ARC-520 could possibly cure HBV, which none of the existing treatment can do.</span>Also, the sales estimate is just 10% of what Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ) achieved with its Hep C treatment in the first year.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The treatment cost is assumed at $100,000, which is in-line with the treatment cost for GILD's Hep C treatment.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The penetration rate is assumed at 5% because ARWR could possibly face competition as several other companies are developing HBV treatments currently.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Peak penetration rate is assumed at 15% and peak sales are estimated at more than $3 billion.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The gross revenue is adjusted in order to account for possible discounts.</span>GILD's gross-to-net adjustment in the first year for its Hep C treatment was 22%.This is expected to increase to more than 40% in 2015 as the company has signed a number of deals with PBMs.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>For ARC-520, I have assumed gross-to-net adjustment of 30%.</span>Based on my sales estimate, discount rate of 15% (reasonable estimate for early stage biotech companies), continued growth rate of 1%, ARC-520 has a risk-adjusted value per share of $14.45.At last check on Wednesday, ARWR shares were trading at just $7.40.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This is nearly half of the risk-adjusted value of ARC-520.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And remember, as I noted last time, nearly 30% of ARWR's price per share can be accounted for by its cash position.</span>It must also be noted that the sales estimate is only for the U.S. and Western Europe.Both regions have the lowest prevalence of HBV.Globally, an estimated 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV.The U.S. and Western Europe only account for less than 1% of the global chronically infected HBV population.Of course, it is more prevalent in poorer parts of the world and therefore if ARC-520 is made available in these places, it will have to offer a significant discount like Gilead has done with its Hep C treatment.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But even if a hefty discount is offered, the sales potential from the rest of the world could be significant.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>And this means that the value of ARC-520 could be significantly higher than the $14.45/share I have calculated.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The risk as I have noted earlier is a crowded market.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>ARC-520 is leading in the race at the moment; however, a crowded market could result in a pricing war like the one seen in the Hep C market.</span>This would mean the company will have to offer significant discount.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>But even after assuming a gross-to-net adjustment of 50%, the value of ARC-520 comes to around $10, and I have not yet considered ARWR's other candidates.</span>Source: Arrowhead Trades At Just 50% Value Of ARC-520 Disclosure: The author is long ARWR, GILD.(More...)The author
