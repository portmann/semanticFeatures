if sobering, assessment of the state of the economy from the perspective of working men and women, as well as retirees, and focused on the hypocrisy of corporations and the wealthy that poor-mouth as a way to extract even more subsidies and tax breaks.Sanders called for an end to socialism for the rich, or what he calls �Robin Hood in reverse� and demanded the government do more to promote job creation and better wages.The fact that a speech like this is noteworthy is a testament to how the Democratic party has become a pro-corporate venture which generously allows women, gays, Hispanics, and people of color to join in the looting.?The Money Laundering Web: HSBC, Margaret Hodge, Sir Alan Duncan, Vitol�and Mossack Fonseca Gail Tverberg: The Oil Glut and Low Prices Reflect an Affordability Problem ?The fact that a speech like this is noteworthy is a testament to how the Democratic party has become a pro-corporate venture which generously allows women, gays, Hispanics, and people of color to join in the looting.Agreed, but nowhere in this clip did I hear Mr. Sanders point that out.He put the blame entirely on Republicans.I apologize if I missed something, but such a partial slant harnesses the truth to political rhetoric.Isn�t this the same guy who just invited Net-�n-Yahoo to give a campaign speech in front of the US congress?Always consider the source, and Sanders is a senator�i.e. not a trustworthy person, period.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He�s been going on with his populist rhetoric for decades now (it seems like anyway) with essentially nothing to show for it.</span>Talk is cheap, and while I appreciate wanting to highlight the occasional bright spot in our national legislative body, I feel like this sort of thing is a distraction.When�s the last time the US Senate made a decision on the basis of the common good?Why do we expect that they ever will?And if we admit that they most likely never will, then why should we waste our time paying attention to what any of them, even the odd �progressive� outlier, has to say�about anything.It�s all hot-air and BS anyway, right?Am I missing something?I�d rather we focus our attention where we, the people, can actually have an independent effect on outcomes.I�d rather we spend a lot less time focusing on what noises the politicians are making, and a lot more focusing on how we can solve our own problems without resorting to politicians.I feel about politicians the same way I feel about other people�s kids: They can be cute, for awhile, but generally it�s best to just ignore them and hope they go away.While I agree with you completely, we HAVE to pay attention to what they�re saying (and doing or not) as they work actively against us gaining any ability to solve any problems without their, or their masters�, say-so.I guess it�s that old �keep enemies closer� thing�these folks are not harmless, we ignore them at great peril.Yeah, I wasn�t sure how to take that either; it clearly wasn�t sarcasm, so it must be cluelessness.Juan Cole wrote a post last month, when Bernie announced he wouldn�t be attending, titled �When you’ve Lost Bernie Sanders: How Netanyahu destroyed the Israel Lobby�.Sanders isn�t a Democrat.He�s an independent and a Socialist.And do you really expect him to have any successes when he�s one out of 100 members of the Senate?I disagree with the viewpoint that he has essentially nothing to show for his populist speaking.Sanders was one of the few people who has successfully bartered.He managed to acquire funding for free clinics when health care reform was being negotiated.He successfully got an amendment to audit the Fed accomplished.Is the guy perfect?No.However, I don�t think that he should be judged on the whole merits of the body he works for and instead should be judged for his own words and actions.It�s uplifting to hear a U.S. Senator speak to this serious issue of income disparity but I suspect it falls on too many deaf ears in Washington.In fact, I suspect that if the camera that was focused on Sanders panned back about the time he was finishing his presentation you would see many in the room on the GOP side and the corporate lobbyists sitting at the testimony table removing the ear plugs they had so firmly planted prior to Sander�s speech.The correct name for �socialism for the rich� is Fascism.The government will be able to promote job creation and better wages only if we stop allowing banks to control the government.Unfortunately neither political party is interested in making this happen.The fact that a speech like this is noteworthy is a testament to how the Democratic party has become a pro-corporate venture which generously allows women, gays, Hispanics, and people of color to join in the looting.Hmmm.So it was better when the Democratic Party was a pro-Southern party that tried to prop up the Slave Power and U.S. feudalism?Andrew Jackson�s idea of �identity politics� was white supremacist, which led to the Trail of Tears for the Cherokees and the Choctaws.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So I see you�ve been pwned by the Democrats.Even Martin Luther King, when he spoke out against Vietnam, described his civil rights campaign as having failed because the money being poured into the war effort was leading to cuts in programs designed to help lift blacks out of poverty and was also resulting in young black men going to war in disproportionate numbers, since they could not obtain college deferrments.</span>This country now has less class mobility than medieval Europe had, but that�s OK by you since we have, for instance, black attorneys general who refuse to prosecute any senior or even mid level bankers for the financial crisis (Loretta Lynch is expected to hew to the pattern set by Holder).And the party is now trying to improve its optics, late in the game, as the rank and file in those groups realize they�ve been had.For instance, Emily�s list (which BTW skews affluent in who it targets for fundraising) has started talking up equal pay for women because a right to an abortion is meaningless if you can�t afford to pay for one.Yet have you heard anyone in the Democratic party leadership throw their support behind strikes by fast food workers and nurses for better pay and working conditions?Look at this post by the Democratic party organ otherwise known as Daily Kos as an indicator: Fast food strikes are turning into a movement for low-wage worker justice .<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Kos is touting the strikes because it�s presumed to be more pro-labor than the Republicans, despite having done virtually perilous little on that front (note this is in part due to organized labor�s fecklessness).</span>So what do we see in this story?Not a single quote from a Democrat supporting the strikes, or for that matter, the concept of a $15 an hour minimum wage!Trust me, Kos would have included one if anyone had made a statement.Yves: No, I am not a Democrat.At a certain point, any leftist has to leave them behind.But they do serve nice vegan dishes at fundraisers.I was checking on where you were coming from.1.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I am concerned when people imply �identity politics� without acknowledging the overwhelming historic burden of white surpemacists and the assumption that white is right.</span>The default �American� identity has its problems.I am reminded that the largest mass lynching in U.S. history was of Italians in New Orleans.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>So race has to be dealt with�with a possibility of Ta-Nehisi Coates�s call for reparation and MLK�s call for equality and peace (and an end to the delusions of U.S. foreign policy).</span>I very often find the term �identity politics� to be a dog-whistle for �blacks� grievances are not legitimate.https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/hillary-clinton-womens-rights-feminism/ A class oppressor is a class oppressor is a class oppressor.This is a very hard lesson for white women in general, with so much of feminism tied to careerism.The current push for more women on corporate boards is just window dressing for the haute bourgeoisie and its need to loot.As you point out, the Democrats flee from organization by workers and from any contact with unions.Bill Clinton famously so.3.A class / economic analysis of our current problems is what is required.The U.S. Gini quotient is higher than ever.Yet class analysis doesn�t go well among U.S. liberals, who are inclined to feel that a feeling for equality is what matters (it�s all a feeling) and who aren�t committed to redistributionist policies, if they ever were.4.I find that many groups have legitimate grievances (like those lynched Italians and their descendants), yet an obstacle is that so many groups are so �offended.This is a rhetorical stance common in both parties used to eliminate discussion.Both parties trade in how �offended� their constituencies are.Witness the letter to Iran from the Senate Republicans and the responses.Yves, in my view, Sanders needs to call out the Democrats.And Sherrod Brown and Alan Grayson should join him.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Maybe it would give courage to a few others� What a disingenuous piece of claptrap�creating a straw man of the antebellum South in discussing Dem Party use of identity politics.</span>Weak.I for one sincerely appreciate Bernie�s bravery and honesty in holding up a mirror to the hypocrisy in both parties.Speaking truth to power puts one on national security lists and he has no fear in that regard.No one else does it like Bernie and if he runs for Prez, he gets my vote.He�s the closest fit to fearless about Wall St and crony capitalism we�re going to get.The only other I can think of is Alan Grayson and he gets no air time.The impact of a speech like this must not only be measured by its influence on legislation and other politicians, but also on the average citizen.With the intentional grinding of legislative processes to a halt, we are left with transforming our oligarchy through a mass social movement.I, for one, will share Sanders� speech with the low wage workers I am organizing who, on the whole, better understand what he is talking about today than they did 10 years ago.They are sick and tired of being sick and tired.And they are building their power to make the changes they need to live a more human life.What�s telling is that although Bernie Sanders and Angus King are independents, both are obliged to caucus with Democrats.It�s because the Depublicrat duopoly controls the committee structure in Congress, where legislation actually gets crafted.Without getting slotted into the committee structure, an independent legislator would be unable to accomplish anything.Nothing in the constitution authorized the duopolistic takeover of Congress.But it is used very effectively to keep independents like Bernie Sanders on a short leash, and to discourage others from showing up.It�s good to highlight a speech like this, if for no other reason than to have it get a wider audience.Speaking only for myself, I�m not a huge Bernie Sanders fan, but whatever� I like what he says, but I don�t see him doing very much.One can argue that point, I�m sure.That said, given that a Senator is making these comments bears some repetition if only because it�s an antidote the corporate fascist propaganda, which cries poor mouth about the corporations and how the �free market� is the solution to absolutely everything.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Do I expect a speech like this to make a difference in people�s opinions?</span>No.But if no one ever says anything like this � eg, the TRUTH � then we�re really cooked.That said, yes, what can WE, the 99% do to make effective changes?Waiting for our putative �leaders� to do something for us is a fool�s errand.At this time, I am out of solutions, myself� sadly.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Whenever I see news coverage of the Democratic nomination that refers to who is or might be running, Bernie�s name is NEVER mentioned.</span>Not even in passing.And yet, to watch Bernie over the last several months, it�s very clear that he is running, and everyone in Washington knows this, and openly acknowledges it.Everyone, that is, except the mainstream press.Once again, our media is telling us who we are allowed to vote for.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>You might love Bernie or hate him or not care a whit, but there�s no way that a man who�s spent half his life in Congress should be ignored by the media when he runs for President on the left side of the ballot while any clown on the right who can rub two nickels together gets star billing.</span>Thanks for posting Bernie�s speech.Sadly it will only be seen by people who have the time and inclination to seek out alternate sources of news (like NC).You�ll never hear these words on the Teevee Nightly News.I�d really love to see Bernie as POTUS and use the Bully Pulpit to tell Mericans to �Wake The F**K Up!</div></body></html>
