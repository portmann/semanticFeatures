Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) Cramer said that Honeywell is one of the best-run companies in America, and the Chairman and CEO Dave Cote is a great leader.He interviewed Cote to find out where the company is headed.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>"We have a plethora of new products that will go around the world in almost every single business.</span>When I go back 13 years ago, we had just an empty pipeline.Now every single business has great new products and a lot of it is software based," said Cote.He spoke about how everything is connected today and that consumers will be taking control of their homes, factories, cars etc. via connectivity, where Honeywell is setting a strong footprint.Speaking about competition, he said that China is doing very good and has moved from No. 20 to No. 2 very quickly.If it keeps doing things right, it will be at the top.Commenting on the capital structure, he said the company will be raising dividends, investing in M&A and buying back stock.Cote talked about himself being bearish for the last four years but bullish this year as he sees strength in the economy."So I'm going to make sure that I'm still conservative.But I think the effect of lower oil prices, especially in any oil-importing country, will put a lot of money in consumers' pockets," said Cote.Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ) trades at just 12 times earnings and it has been stable above $100.Cramer thinks it is one of the best stocks in biotech.Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB ) is another stock that Cramer is bullish on.He thinks the stock has room to run higher.Although Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG ) has seen a dip lately, Cramer thinks CEO Robert Hugin is capable of overcoming all challenges.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN ) has stalled lately, but it has an anticholesterol drug in its pipeline.Cardiologists are excited about this drug and so is Cramer.BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: BMRN ) and Isis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ISIS ) are two stocks in the emerging biotech field that Cramer has his eye on.Lastly, Alkermes Plc (NASDAQ: ALKS ) is another stock that Cramer is bullish on.He thinks the stock is cheap at current prices due the opportunities it has.CEO interview - Halyard Health (NYSE: HYH ) Halyard Health was spun off by Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB ) four months back.The stock reported better than expected earnings on Wednesday but still fell due to the concern the spin-off costs are impacting guidance for 2015.Cramer interviewed CEO Robert Abernathy to find out more."We were laser focused, and we immediately started investing in research and development because research drives our strategy.We delivered a very strong quarter where we had sales and profit growth," said Abernathy.He also said that the company has generated significant cash flow and has about $149M on the balance sheet.Commenting on the strategic use of cash, he said, "In year one, in 2015, we want to continue to get off of those transition services agreements from Kimberly-Clark.In year two, we want to be ready to move rapidly to get some strategic acquisitions done to grow in our medical device category."He added that eventually the company wants to shift to high growth, high margin products.Cramer said that the company has a very low following on the Wall Street, but it has a big room to run, and he thinks now is a good opportunity to buy.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Jim Cramer�s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer�s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.</span>Start your FREE 14-day trial now!We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
