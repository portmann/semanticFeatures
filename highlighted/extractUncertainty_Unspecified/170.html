(NYSE: ABBV ), Enbrel by Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN ) and Remicade by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), which are all expensive ($15,000 per year) with many adverse events like increased risk of tuberculosis, heart problems, and some cancers.</span>Dr. Fishman emphasized that CF101 has shown in trials an excellent safety profile in its oral form.She also comments: "Our CF101 directly targets the A3 adenosine receptor, known to be overexpressed in inflammatory cells, binds in a specific way to this target, A3AR, inducing apoptosis (death) of these cells, thereby inducing an anti-rheumatic effect".Normal body cells have low expression of the A3 adenosine receptor and as such not affected by CF101, accounting for the lack of adverse effects.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Here is the link between the A3 adenosine receptor and its value as a biomarker, in Dr. Fishman's words: "The A3AR, besides being a therapeutic target, serves also as a biological marker to predict patients' response to CF101.</span>The company found that there is a direct correlation between A3AR prior to treatment with the drug and patients' response.Those patients who had high expression of A3AR prior to treatment were those who responded to the CF101 treatment in a positive way.The company reported that 70% of the RA patient population had over-expression of the biomarker prior to treatment.We intend to utilize the A3AR biomarker to identify patients with RA who will be the ones to benefit from the drug before it is given."Can-Fite intends to accomplish what comes at the heart of personalized medicine.Biomarkers can indicate how any particular drug, whether studied in trials or on the market, will lead to a desired clinical response.The FDA recently recognized the importance of biomarkers in personalized medicine with its attention to a House Bill draft titled "21st Century Cures Act", which included a process to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of biomarkers.Contrary to its snail-paced implementation of policy, the agency quickly issued a questionnaire to all associated parties to gather information on specific aspects of drug development and disease areas most benefited from upcoming biomarkers, with comments due this April.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>The Bill stresses that advances in genomics and other technologies give researchers new ways to proactively treat patients under a personalized medicine approach, based on patients' unique set of circumstances that may include socioeconomic factors as well as what they're born with genetically, and that biomarker utilization can mean the difference between life and death.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>New FDA-approved treatments may not reach patients soon enough unless clinical trial time is shortened, and administrative burdens to conducting trials lessened, so proponents of the Bill urge the FDA to consider leveraging advancements in technology to "weed out" unsafe or ineffective compounds sooner, and concentrate on the best treatment with the best potential to get patients healed.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I asked Dr. Fishman her thoughts on why this long-time goal of biomarkers to further personalized medicine, particularly in RA, had not been realized, and what she believes can be remedied.</span>She pointed out that older tests, like polyglutamate measurement of methotrexate's effectiveness, can take months to show a benefit from the drug and hinder usefulness in guiding therapy.A much newer one, Vectra DA, measures 12 blood biomarkers for RA but only provides limited information in optimizing care.The Anti-CCP2 Test has been around since 2011, but does not have much impact on personalized medicine.My research confirmed Dr. Fishman's thoughts.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Physicians soon hope to individually tailor RA treatments for patients who, each one, is different in progression of their disease and their response to therapy, a task not yet met.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Dr. Fishman believes that Can-Fite's biomarker will be superior to current offerings because biologic treatments mostly consist of monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), hard to find in serum or blood cells.</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Can-Fite's remedy, by contrast is, in Dr. Fishman's description "Upregulated only under pathological conditions such as autoimmune inflammatory situations, therefore can be followed up and analyzed prior to treatment and can serve as a predictor of patients' response to CF101".</span>This is the core of personalized medicine.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Can-Fite's A3AR biomarker will be the first in rheumatology, according to Dr. Fishman and my own research, and could have applications to other autoimmune disease such as psoriasis, an indication the company has been pursuing in the clinic and where Phase I/II trials have been completed (see below for current pipeline).</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>In addition, Can-Fite announced last December the conclusion of design for its Phase III study in RA using CF101, a 300-patient clinical trial that will be held at several centers, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, with two separate doses of the drug given orally twice daily for 12 weeks.</span>Use of the A3AR biomarker is integral to the study as only patients with elevated baseline expression levels of the biomarker will be enrolled and correlation to patients' response scrutinized at the end of the trial.Given the positive results from an earlier Phase IIb under similar parameters, CF101 will be used alone and not in combination with other compounds typically given for RA.Rheumatoid arthritis is big business.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Industry information provider Visiongain based out in London recently predicted the RA market to generate revenue of $38.5 billion in 2017, due to prevalence of the disease that needs long-term treatment that goes hand-in-hand with high sales volume.</span>It is estimated that worldwide growth will shrink after that, from expiration of patented biologic drugs for RA and competition from 'biosimilars'.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This could represent a good opportunity for Can-Fite's CF101 which would help gain back market share if out-licensed to replace the major biologics - Humira by AbbVie Inc. ( ABBV ), Enbrel by Amgen Inc. ( AMGN ), and Remicade by Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ).</span>Note all are injected intravenously whereas CF101 is in tablet form, a clinical advantage.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>An investment in Can-Fite comes with standard small-cap risks: market capitalization is under $50 million with average three-month trading volume under 50,000 shares, and lack of adequate news flow to keep shares liquid.</span>However, Can-Fite has been generous with information updates, giving investors a chance to review current progress.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>One specific risk is that clinical trials for the company's Phase IIb in RA were done at 1mg of CF101; Phase III trials will be conducted at higher dosages and may not translate into the same positive results.</span>Can-Fite has proven adept at harnessing the A3 adenosine receptor for autoimmune, inflammatory diseases with good results.When their biomarker is finalized, personalized medicine will take a step closer to clinical reality.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Approval of CF101 for RA, a brand new therapy for this terrible disease, would propel Can-Fite into a nearly $40 billion industry while reshaping the future of RA therapy.</span>Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less than a $100 million market cap.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.</span>Source: Can-Fite's A3AR Biomarker Targets Patients For Highest Efficacy In Phase III Trial Disclosure: The author is long CANF.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it.The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
