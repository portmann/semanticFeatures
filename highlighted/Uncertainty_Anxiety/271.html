MBLY , NFLX , NXPI , RDS.A , RDS.B , ROST , UNP , WTW by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani NXP's acquisition of Freescale is a game-changer.Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Monday, March 2.Cramer found Monday's market move humorous because he thinks that the market loves any move a CEO makes.Although he believes in the strength of the economy, such moves could be a recipe for disaster.The move in large cap stocks on Monday was due to Warren Buffett's letter, where he praised big American businesses."In his even more brilliant than usual investment letter, Buffett says if you believe in American progress, you have to own, long term, great American businesses.If you don't, you should buy bonds," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>He is worried a bit that markets are viewing key corporate decisions with rose-colored glasses.</span>For instance, when NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ: NXPI ) announced Freescale Semiconductors' acquisition (NYSE: FSL ), both stocks rallied, while in a normal scenario, only the target company rallies.Another such instance was seen when Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH ) announced it would acquire Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ ) Cordis cardiovascular unit.Usually the market picks one winner in such a transaction, but instead both stocks rallied.Cramer thinks this is unusual and it could make the market frothy.Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) move was another over-positive reaction by the market.While the stock rallied on Friday after announcing the new season of "House of Cards", it should have eased on Monday but it kept rallying higher."Talk about positive, that's just plain bizarre," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Cramer still does not want investors to worry as the market is not in dangerous territory like 2000 or 2008.</span>He however thinks investors should be critical of moves that are not correct."As long as we don't go all devil may care, I can make my peace with it.Maybe happiness isn't so bad after all."Cramer said that lots of retailers reported surprisingly good numbers.It was not a surprise though, considering lower price of gasoline, which gave consumers more disposable income.Cramer talked about four companies that really rose above the pack and were surprise winners.First is Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST ).The company delivered better than expected results and 6% same-store sales growth, which according to Cramer was phenomenal.Ross Stores will be opening many more stores and Cramer thinks that with the same-store sales growth of the company, it's not too late to own the stock.Next surprise came from Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ).Although the company missed on earnings and the stock went down, it started rallying as investors heard on the conference call that the company was spending money to boost its online presence.Cramer thinks the EPS will start rebounding dramatically after the spending is done and the benefits start coming in.Dillard's (NYSE: DDS ) also came in with a surprise when the company posted better than expected revenues.Cramer thinks Dillard's has executed one of the most impressive retail turnarounds in recent history.As the company has been shutting under-performing stores and buying back stock, Cramer thinks the stock has more room to run, especially considering that it is trading at 13.5 times next year's earnings.Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ) joined the surprise party by reporting an earnings beat with higher than expected revenues.Kohl's has almost 25M customers in the loyalty plan which exceeds the management goal.The stock was trading at an 8-year high before the pullback on Monday.Cramer thinks that Kohl's has its groove back.Cramer said he was struck by one of the most insightful letters this weekend by Warren Buffett.He praised the letter and mentioned that he cannot recall any other where the mistakes made were highlighted in a transparent fashion, pointing to $443M loss in the U.K. supermarket.Buffett also praised the competitor Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) in his letter.Cramer thinks that if it were any other CEO praising the competition, he would have been shackled by shareholders.He also said that in the case of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ), shareholders are actually reporting to Buffett.Cramer is of the view that although it is good to praise Buffett and treat his company like an institution, people should adopt his methods and business strategy too.Cramer also said that things in the business world could be different if all the CEOs approached them the way Buffett is."Clearly something's gone awry in the business world if we can praise this one man for everything he does, and yet every other chief executive feels shackled into being nothing like him," said Cramer.Cramer said that though Buffett is one of the smartest investors around, it would be false to think that it's a one-off story.He thinks there can be a different wonderful way of creating wealth for shareholders, like Buffett has.NXP Semiconductors moved up 17% on the takeover news of Freescale Semiconductor.Cramer says this is a special case as typically, it is the target company that moves higher.In this case however, this acquisition will be a game-changer for the company.Cramer thinks this may be the best merger in the semiconductor industry till now.NXP is the 14th largest player in semis and Freescale is the 18th largest.Together, they will be the 4th largest.NXP is all about connected car and connected cellphone, while Freescale is dominant in digital networking chips, radio frequency devices and sensors.Cramer thinks together they will dominate the auto market at a critical time when cars and all things are rapidly becoming more connected.Although with the merger, the debt load will significantly rise, Cramer thinks that the company will generate more cash flow over time and will be able to bring the balance sheet back to normal in 1.5 years."I believe this NXP Freescale deal tops all of the others, creating a powerhouse that will dominate the connected car and the Internet of Things, which is why I think NXP is still a buy."Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY ): Cramer does not like the stock.He'd rather buy NXP Semiconductor and Freescale.Chevron (NYSE: CVX ): Cramer doesn't encourage owning oil stocks, but if one is keen, they should buy Royal Dutch (NYSE: RDS.A ) (NYSE: RDS.B ), which is also held by his charitable trust.Weight Watchers (NYSE: WTW ): "There is no level where I want to own the stock."We only use your
