(NYSE: BABA ).While the stock soared after the IPO to $120 a share, investors have bailed on the name and the latest earnings report did not satisfy.Recently, shares have been trading in the low $80s, and an important lockup expiration is nearing.Today, I'll detail how short interest recently hit a new high for the stock, and why we might see a further increase.Alibaba shares began trading in September 2014, so we don't exactly have years of short interest data to analyze.However, there have been 11 official updates from Nasdaq, and as some might expect, short interest has risen over time.In the chart below, you can see a history of Alibaba short interest since the IPO.At the end of February update , nearly 57 million shares were short the stock.Short interest has nearly tripled since the first update, and the most recent update was obviously a new high.According to data from Yahoo Finance, Alibaba has nearly 2.5 billion shares outstanding , so about 2.3% of that is short.I should also note that the days to cover ratio, which measures how long it would take all shorts to close out their positions given average volume, hit a new high of 5.44 at the latest update.However, the float for Alibaba is much less as there are currently a large number of shares held by insiders and not available for sale just yet.Based on Yahoo's float data, a little more than 5% of the float was short at the end of February.There is an important item to discuss, however, because Alibaba is nearing a key lockup expiration date.There was a lot of confusing information regarding this upcoming event, so here's the company's official statement : In light of press stories containing different expiration dates that have recently come to Alibaba Group's attention regarding the lock-up period ending in March 2015, Alibaba Group confirms that approximately 437 million ordinary shares (including approximately 8 million restricted share units and share options that vested after the IPO) subject to the 180-day lock-up period described in Alibaba Group's IPO prospectus will be available for sale to the public commencing March 18, 2015.Of these ordinary shares that will no longer be subject to the 180-day lock-up starting from March 18, 2015, approximately 100 million shares will nevertheless remain subject to Alibaba Group's employee trading restrictions until after the announcement in May 2015 of its earnings results for the quarter and fiscal year ending March 31, 2015.Since Yahoo lists a float of 1.12 billion shares, this lockup expiration could significantly increase the stock's float.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This could explain why shares have done poorly lately as investors worry that a large number of shares coming to market could depress prices.</span>Should the float rise a bit, it also probably will mean that short interest will rise further, since more shares will probably be available to short.On Wednesday morning, Alibaba shares were down more than a dollar to approximately $81.50, just a buck and a half from their post-IPO low.Investors seem to be concerned about the upcoming lockup, and short interest recently hit a new high.With US markets becoming a bit uneasy into earnings season thanks to a sharp rise in the US dollar, fear over Alibaba's lockup could send this stock to a new low in the next couple of weeks.I wouldn't be surprised if shares dropped into the $70s as this lockup expiration is digested.Source: Alibaba Short Interest Rises As Lockup Expiration Nears Disclosure: The author has no positions in
