The Brexit dust is beginning to settle. It’s now more than seven weeks since the vote and some of the effects on matters relating to our finances are beginning to crystallise.

What is clear is that the more lurid predictions made by the Remain camp before the vote have not come to pass.

Here we look at some of those predictions and take stock of what Brexit has done to interest rates, inflation, pensions, foreign exchange rates and more.

Interest rates

The prediction That rates would rise.

Key quote “Mortgages would be harder to get and more expensive [in the event of Brexit]” – David Cameron and George Osborne, writing in the Telegraph on May 22.

What has actually happened Mortgage rates, and other interest rates, have fallen in response to Brexit.

Analysis The former prime minister and chancellor presumably expected sterling to fall far more than it did after the vote, forcing the Bank of England to raise rates to attract money back to Britain. But although the pound has fallen, the decline has not been calamitous (see below). 

As a result, the Bank was able to cut rates earlier this month. More than one million borrowers with “tracker” mortgages have benefited, and many lenders have also passed the falls on to other borrowers on variable rates. Those who want to take out fixed-rate loans have also seen rates fall.

The price of these deals is driven by interest rates in the broader financial markets, such as yields on gilts (government bonds), which have fallen to new record lows. 

Savers have of course suffered as a result of the Bank’s initiatives, in particular a new scheme to give banks access to cheap money, bypassing depositors. 

Inflation

The prediction Inflation will rise.

Key quote “Because the pound would be worth less, everything we import would become more expensive, increasing inflation and hurting family budgets” – Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne in their Telegraph article.

What has actually happened The pound has fallen and inflation is expected to rise, although the effects take time to work through the economy.

Analysis The fall in sterling predicted before the vote has come to pass, and inflation can be expected to follow in time. Pantheon Macroeconomics, the consultancy, said the outlook was for “much higher inflation” and predicted the consumer prices index (CPI) measure to reach 2.6pc in 2017, with the retail prices index (RPI) rising by 3.5pc that year.

State pension

The prediction The “triple lock”, which increases the state pension by the higher of wage or price inflation, subject to a 2.5pc minimum, will come under pressure.

Key quote “So here is the reality: if we leave, the pensioner benefits would be under threat, and the triple lock could no longer be guaranteed in the long term” – Mr Cameron, writing in the Telegraph on June 11.

What has actually happened Theresa May has committed to keeping the triple lock for the rest of this parliament. “The manifesto contains a commitment to protect the triple lock. That commitment still stands,” Downing Street said in a statement earlier this month.

Analysis Mr Cameron could still be proved right, depending on what exactly he meant by “in the long term”. Economic developments could render the triple lock unaffordable for the next government.

Baroness Altmann, who was pensions minister under Mr Cameron, has said the commitment to the 2.5pc minimum rise should be scrapped, leading to a “double lock”. “Absolutely, we must protect pensioner incomes, but the 2.5pc bit doesn’t make sense,” she told The Observer.

“If, for example, we went into a period of deflation where everything, both earnings and prices, was falling, then putting pensions up by 2.5pc is out of all proportion.” 

Pension pots

The prediction Private pension pots would fall in value because Brexit would cause share prices to decline.

Key quote “Markets may anticipate adverse economic effects, provoking an abrupt reaction to an exit vote?… this could entail sharp drops in equity prices” – International Monetary Fund statement on UK, May 2016.

What has actually happened After an initial sharp fall, the stock market has rallied strongly to levels higher than those before the vote.

Analysis Most workers other than fortunate members of final salary pension schemes have their retirement savings tied up in the stock market. Share prices therefore have a direct impact on the financial prospects of millions of Britons.

The London stock market did fall dramatically in the days after the Brexit vote, but has recovered strongly since.

Many company pension schemes invest a portion of their members’ money in overseas markets and these assets have appreciated strongly in sterling terms since the vote, thanks to the fall in the value of the pound.

However, younger pension savers would arguably be better off with lower share prices, which would allow their regular contributions to buy more shares or fund units. Their older counterparts will be more concerned with the value of their accumulated pots, which will broadly be higher in the wake of the vote.

Sterling

The prediction The pound would fall sharply if Britain voted to leave the EU.

Key quote “An abrupt and total interruption to incoming capital flows in response to a Brexit could see the pound decline by as much as 15pc-20pc” – analysts at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, in February.

What has actually happened The pound has weakened, although less than expected. 

Analysis Widespread predictions of a severe “run on the pound” have failed to materialise. Instead, sterling fell by about 10pc against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the vote, hitting $1.32.

Since then it has been more stable, although it had fallen a little further to $1.30 on Friday. Its trading against the euro has followed a similar pattern; £1 currently buys about €1.16, down from €1.32 before the vote.

And what no one saw coming?…

The Brexit vote also had some immediate consequences that few commentators seem to have predicted.

First, some property funds were forced to suspend trading following a rush of investors who wanted to take out their money.

There were fears that the commercial property market would suffer in the wake of Brexit, and “open-ended” property funds are not suited to handling large withdrawals in a short period. Many of these funds remain suspended.

Second, final salary pension schemes have suffered from the further decline in gilt yields and interest rates. Their deficits, which are largely determined by gilt yields, have increased markedly since the vote.

This is likely to have been one of the factors that prompted Royal Mail to warn members of its final salary scheme that their pensions might become unaffordable in two years’ time, forcing it to close.

There has been speculation that embattled final salary schemes may have to be allowed to back down on some of their promises to ensure their viability, and to help keep their sponsoring companies afloat.
