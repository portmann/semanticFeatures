alcoa: No Longer An Interesting Risk-Reward Situation
Jul.21.16 | About: alcoa, Inc. (AA)

Summary
•alcoa outperformed after a favorable earnings report, which actually masked the deterioration in its Value-Add operations.
•By this article's estimates, Value-Add by itself is worth less than the current price, and the free optionality is gone.
•Returns from here will be driven by better commodity prices and asset sales.
•There is low visibility for either, and the stock no longer represents a compelling investment, in my view.

alcoa's Q2

alcoa (NYSE:AA) reported adjusted Q2 EPS of $0.15 versus a consensus of $0.09. The beat was from much better than expected results (although expectations had soured severely coming in) in Primary Metals, particularly on the cost side, with ATOI coming in at $41 million compared to Q1 levels of $14 million. Results in the other segments were either in line with or slightly ahead of Street estimates. While H2 2016 estimates are benefitting from an improving upstream environment, AA's guidance for its Value-Add (Arconic) businesses for 3Q was generally weaker than expected, relative to both Street numbers and management's own guidance. The company's expectations for its end markets are being revised downwards after every quarter, it seems.

In Q1, the company announced a substantial revision downward for its revenue guidance in its EPS segment. Whereas it previously expected $7 billion-plus of revenue, it expected slightly above $6 billion. In this quarter, the outlook continued to sour. AA expects its end markets to continue to soften. In Aerospace, it sees global sales growth of 3%, as opposed to the 6-8% it expected in Q1 (keep in mind, these expectations were already revised down from the 2015 projections). It continues to emphasize no further reductions in growth expectations for Automotive, Construction, Packaging, and other smaller end markets. In my view, there is certainly a lack of credibility and what seems to be an inability to have proper visibility into the end markets. Investors don't seem to think so, and the stock went up in value after the earnings release, but I have my doubts. In any case, the free call option on the aluminum aspect of the thesis (which was my original view on the company) no longer holds.
