U.S. IPO Weekly Recap: No IPOs In Final Week Of A Challenging February | Seeking Alpha Mar.  3, 2015 12:15 PM ET  |  Includes: AJX , CHEKU , CPPL , INOV , ITEK , NVTA by: Renaissance Capital IPO Research There were no initial public offerings in the past week, but recent IPO performance continues to trend up. The 24 IPOs in 2015 now average +18%, including +5% after the first day, its highest point this year. A few highlights from February 2015: • 10 IPOs priced in February, down from 20 in 2014 • These returned 7.5% on average; none have gained over 21% • 6 IPOs postponed in February, up from 1 last year Five health care companies went public in February and five more postponed their IPOs. Of the five, only genetic test provider Invitae (NYSE: NVTA ) has gained more than 2%. Two companies (NASDAQ: CHEKU ) (NASDAQ: ITEK ) received a greater valuation cut that 95% of 2014 IPOs and proceeded to trade flat. Bellerophon (NASDAQ: BLPH ) had the worst first-day performance for a biotech (-25%) in over 10 years and Nexvet (NASDAQ: NVET ) didn't do much better (-11%), but both have since climbed up to the IPO price. Don't expect the poor performance of these IPOs to dry up the pipeline; new health care companies continue to submit initial filings. With energy stocks in the tank, REITs could replace MLPs as the 2015 IPO dividend play. We could also see a shift from MLPs with oil and gas collection assets to those with storage and long-distance transportation assets (NYSE: CPPL ), (Pending: PESL ), (Pending: PESC ) or GPs with their distribution rights (Pending: EQGP ), (Pending: TEGP ). Columbia Pipeline Partners LP (LP) was the best-performing February IPO, up 20% from its offer price, and the year's first to raise over $1 billion. Transportation assets are still necessary even with depressed oil and gas prices. Government property REIT Easterly (NYSE: DEA ) saw a moderate gain while sub-performing mortgage REIT Great Ajax (NYSE: AJX ) has had sub-par performance, down 1%. Inovalon (NASDAQ: INOV ), February's only tech IPO, priced above the range and ended its first day flat. It has since traded up 15%, providing retail investors with the chance to capture all of its gains. The Renaissance IPO Index, a market cap weighted basket of newly public companies that is designed to represent the US IPO market, has traded up nearly 6% year-to-date, close to its all-time high. Renaissance Capital's IPO ETF (NYSE: IPO ) tracks the index, and top ETF holdings include Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS ), Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), Hilton (NYSE: HLT ) and Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY ).
