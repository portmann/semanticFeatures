Learn more about PRO » TransCanada stock has dropped significantly in the past few months, despite a business model largely insulated from commodity price risk. The company intends to grow EBITDA by 8-10% per year through 2020. TransCanada (NYSE: TRP ), one of the largest pipeline operators in Canada, has suffered recently owing to political bickering over the Keystone XL Pipeline, as well as lower growth compared to some of its big cap US peers. The energy markets meltdown hasn't helped, taking TransCanada's stock down by almost 25% from its 2014 highs. That said, there is substantial value in their pipeline and energy assets, and huge growth potential too. The business is predominantly fee-based and fully regulated, meaning as oil and gas prices fall, its cash flows generally won't be affected. Compared to its peers, TRP trades at a hugely discounted level, at roughly 12x Free Cash Flow, compared to its peer group at 17x (Enbridge (NYSE: ENB ), Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ), Williams (NYSE: WMB )). Assuming just a 15x multiple on FCF, which seems quite conservative given the company expects to grow its distribution by 8-10%/year over the next few years, TRP would be worth 30% more than where it is trading today. The figures below are in Canadian dollars unless specified, but the stock trades in significant volume on the NYSE under the ticker TRP (as well as in Toronto under the same ticker). TransCanada operates in 2 primary businesses - pipelines and power. The pipeline business is fully regulated in Canada (as it is in the US on interstate gas pipelines), and generates roughly 75% of the company's EBITDA. The power business is comprised of 20 power plants, roughly half natural gas, 23% nuclear, 15% coal and the rest in renewables. The only sensitivity to commodity prices resides in the power business, which generally is heavily contracted too, so the impact to TRP from lower power prices (often driven by natgas prices) is quite low. More on TransCanada's commodity exposure later. The pipeline business at TRP is predominantly natural gas-driven. The company owns an extensive network of pipes in both Canada and the US (and even in Mexico), and the chart below is quite simplified, but illustrates the location of the Canadian ones. The NGTL system in Alberta and the Canadian Mainline are regulated in Canada by the NEB, who just last November approved a new tolling framework for 2015-2020, ensuring 10% ROEs for the business. The overall EBITDA from the gas pipeline portfolio was $3.2BB last year, or 58% of the company's total EBITDA. While gas production in Western Canada fell every single year from 2007-2013, growth resumed in 2014 and is expected to continue increasing for the next few years. The company also operates gas pipelines in the US, which generated 850mm of the segment's $3.2BB in EBITDA. As an example of growth, the Montney play in Alberta is forecasted to grow from current levels of 3 BCF/day to 6 BCF/day by 2020. Given that the company's asset base is the primary determinant in cash flow, growth from the new $1.7BB Montney Mainline and the new 2016-2017 NGTL pipelines at an anticipated cost of $2.7BB will ensure stable growth at roughly 10% ROEs for the next 2-3 years. To illustrate, $4.4BB of capex from these 2 projects alone, financed 40% with equity, should add $400mm of EBITDA (assuming a 35% tax rate and 5% cost of debt) to the company (at $5.5BB today). Overall, the company has an astounding $46BB in total capex planned between now and 2020-ish, which could take EBITDA from $5.5BB to $10BB in the next 5-8 years. There are literally scads of capex projects listed in TRP's presentations, from small lines to connect to LNG terminals on the West Coast, to larger ones to connect to oil refiners and oil export terminals on the East coast, and everything in between. This is a large company, but as production grows, as LNG facilities get built, and as oil via rail continues to be more expensive than piping, there will be tons of growth-related projects for TransCanada. The company's Liquids Pipeline segment is generally comprised of one massive asset, the Keystone pipeline, which runs today from Hardisty, Alberta down to the US Gulf Coast essentially. Not to be confused with the Keystone XL pipeline that the company has spent 7 years trying to get approved, the Keystone pipeline is at full capacity and generated $1BB of EBITDA last year, up from $700mm 2 years ago. It's worth noting that contracts for the Keystone pipeline are negotiated with customers, typically in long-term take or pay arrangements. That means lower oil prices, and even lower production - should that start to happen, likely would have a limited impact on TRP's cash flow. Oil production out of Alberta today is approximately 3.6mm barrels/day, forecast to grow to 4.6mm by 2020 and 6.4mm by 2030. With the US dithering on approving additional capacity from the Keystone XL pipeline, the company has instead begun to seek regulatory approvals for an even longer, larger pipeline that bypasses the US, and instead, takes oil from Alberta to the East Coast of Canada. This project, named the Energy East pipeline, is estimated to cost $12BB. Given TRP's size, scale and most importantly, its existing TransCanada Mainline pipeline, it is essentially the only game in town to move future oil production out of Alberta to refiners or export destinations on Canada's east coast. The Mainline Pipeline, which is TRP's huge natgas pipeline today, is essentially an underutilized asset. Its capacity is 3.2BCF/day, but according to management, carries a peak day load of 1.7BCF/day. Converting some of the pipeline to an oil pipeline would only reduce capacity to 2.6 BCF/day, and cost-wise, provides a relatively inexpensive means of adding crude pipeline capacity for oil producers. The new Energy East pipeline is being designed to carry 1.1mm barrels/day, and already has firm contracts in place for 1.0mm barrels per day. Assuming the Canadians do not squelch their own oil pipeline, regulatory approval should occur this year, with first oil shipments by late 2018. There has been a recent hiccup with Energy East, as a Buluga whale habitat resides at one of the proposed marine terminals near Cacouna Quebec, at the end of the planned Energy East line. Rumors are that the terminal location will be halted. There are a number of refiners already in the area, and other potential oil export locations too - meaning the impact should be limited, but it is a risk. Understand that significant volumes of oil today is shipped via rail, as pipeline capacity has grown more slowly than production. North Dakota and Alberta alone ship an incredible 1.1mm barrels of crude via rail each day. With rail shipping costs at some $10/barrel, depending on distance, it is a far more expensive means of moving oil. Rail disasters have increased dramatically too, with seemingly new spills every month (Galena IL just last week). Given this danger and higher costs to ship crude via rail, there is huge market share that ultimately TRP should pick up even if oil production stagnates. While the Energy East pipeline is predominately for Alberta oil producers, there is a tie-in proposed to the US Bakken shale in North Dakota that even has the potential to replace the need for the Keystone XL pipeline. Since the US refuses to import more Canadian oil to refiners on the Gulf Coast (as Keystone XL gets vetoed), TRP is proposing to build a pipeline to take US oil produced from the Bakken Shale to export terminals and refiners on their own East coast. TransCanada's energy segment owns 10,900 megawatts (MWs) of power, much of it sold forward through fixed, long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Overall, Energy generated $1.3BB of EBITDA last year, or 25% of the total company's EBITDA. While the Energy segment's results can depend on power demand, often due to colder weather, and hence can show some volatility, generally speaking, EBITDA has grown from $1.1BB in 2008 to $1.35BB last year, around 3%/year. Power demand tends to follow GDP growth, so while not as growth-y as the pipeline business over the next decade, should still continue northward. The Energy business overall is a good one, however, with maintenance capex of around $250-300mm, compared to $1.35BB of EBITDA, throwing off lots of FCF. Management further divides the Energy business into Eastern Power, Western Power (geographically), and Bruce Power (nuclear plants, partially owned). The Eastern power assets are fully hedged, with 20-year PPAs across the entire 3000 MW portfolio. The Eastern segment also began construction in January this year of a 900MW combined cycle gas fired power plant called Napanee. It also has a 20-year PPA in place from its start date, and will cost around $1BB. Bruce Power's output is also fully hedged, and its cash flow simply depends on production. While there will be certain planned maintenance of some of Bruce Power's plants in 2015, longer term, its contract with the Ontario IESO has annual inflation adjustments and PPAs in place for all of its units; PPAs which do not expire until 2020 at the earliest (some to 2037). Western Power's results are not fully hedged, and overall, lead us to discussing the only portion of EBITDA at TRP that has commodity price exposure. Perhaps most worrisome to investors in the midstream energy space today are commodity price impacts on cash flow. Fortunately, the only business with commodity exposure is the Western Energy business, driven by power prices in Alberta. Last year, 2014 EBITDA at Western Power fell by $100mm, from $350mm to $250mm give or take. Power prices in Alberta dropped from $80/MWhr to $50/MWhr, as new capacity in the region crushed power prices. Fortunately, Western Power has hedged 75% of its output, and at its current low prices, further impacts on the cash flow should be limited. Even assuming current prices of $32/MWhr in Alberta, the EBITDA impact would likely be less than $50mm, or 1%. Yes, there will be some downtime with some maintenance at Bruce Power this year, and New York capacity payments might be slightly lower due to a less cold winter this year - but over time, these impacts will normalize and are not a concern of mine. Generally, TransCanada's business is dominated by its gas pipelines. With overall gas production dropping from 2007 to 2013 in Alberta, earnings growth slowed (especially compared to the US). In fact, EPS grew only 2.2% on a compounded basis from 2005 to 2012. Since then, however, with gas production creeping up and increasing demand for its liquids pipelines, EPS growth has jumped to 13% a year since (from $1.89 to $2.42 last year). But perhaps more importantly, TRP provides little guidance on its real FCF, or distributable cash flow as peers like Williams or Kinder Morgan do. While EPS was $2.42 last year, it's worth noting that Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) for pipelines is far higher than maintenance capex. That is, the ongoing cash earnings are higher than its stated earnings. Pipelines last virtually forever, or at least, should last 50+ years once constructed. Lots of maintenance capex is actually expensed too. That means, maintenance (or sustaining) capex is probably in the $900mm range. (Kinder Morgan's maintenance capex is $586mm on $39BB of PP&E, or around 1.5%). Using that 1.5% of pipeline PP&E, plus $250mm of maintenance capex for the Energy assets, yields the 900mm figure. Let's take a look at FCF, or DCF as I estimate for TRP: Unlike KMI or WMB, TRP doesn't break out DCF/share (or distributable cash flow per share). Nor does it give dividend guidance or dividend growth forecasts - numbers that always impress the dividend growth crowd. But speaking of dividends, TRP has an excellent track record of increases: The simple answer is that with growth pretty close to that of KMI or WMB, there seems no reason why TRP cannot trade at a 14-15x FCF multiple. Enbridge trades at 15x and yields 3.1%. WMB and KMI trade at 19x and yield in the mid-4% range. The US comps benefit from greater dividend visibility and a tad more growth, but have much lower coverage ratios and a bit more commodity exposure. A sum-of-the-parts analysis is also compelling. Comps trade today between 14-16x EBITDA on the pipeline side. I used SE, WMB, KMI and ENB. On the Energy side, comps NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG ) and TransAlta ( TAC , TA:CN) trade at 8.6-8.8x. Using the low end for each of these suggests a 25% upside: There also have been arguments by activists (namely Sandell, which did, in fact, exit its position in Q4) to accelerate dropdowns into the US business and spin off the lower-growth Energy segment. TC Pipelines (NYSE: TCP ) is a US-based pipeline MLP that is 28% owned by TransCanada. With $850mm of EBITDA from US gas pipelines, there is lots of dropdown potential that should create value over time. According to management, TCP has $1BB of acquisition capacity per year, and should be able to convert pipeline assets trading at 13x EBITDA to ones trading at 16x EBITDA (TCP's multiple). The Sandell presentation is here and is worth reading. Their math suggests the stock is worth $75 Canadian per share (compared to $54.85 Canadian today). As far as the downside case goes, assuming a 2008-2010 scenario again and a 10% FCF yield on flat EBITDA numbers, the USD version of TRP could trade to $35-37 (around 11x EBITDA, the average in 2009), down 14% after dividends. Speaking of the US dollar, US investors should be aware that the company generates most of its CF in Canadian dollars - another risk worth considering. Like many large cap names, insider ownership is low and the ability to force change difficult - perhaps why Sandell gave up. CEO Russ Girling owns only $6.4mm worth of TRP stock, has been at the company since 1994, and at one point, was its CFO. He is no Rich Kinder, but as a finance guy, I suspect he understands various ways to create value here. It is clear he has been battling hard to win approval for the Keystone XL pipeline against some pretty stiff odds. Fortunately, even without the Keystone XL pipeline, there are still $34BB of growth projects in various stages of development - a huge number considering the company's TEV is $69BB. To sum up, these are high-FCF businesses, with lots of growth for years to come, trading well below market and peer group multiples. Patience will be required in owning TRP, however, as production growth likely will slow in North America, and as regulatory uncertainty over Energy East and Keystone XL linger. That said, investors get paid 3.8% to wait, and can own a business with a decent-sized margin of safety, and ultimately, one that should provide years of growth.
