Acadia Pharmaceuticals Proves It Can't Market Nuplazid Alone - ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ACAD) | Seeking Alpha ACAD's extended submission and CEO resignation caused a 20% decline in the stock. This news is not being taken lightly; it also proves ACAD does not have the necessary requirements to market and supply Nuplazid. After a year of pre-NDA/commercialization activities, Acadia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ACAD ) has for the second time delayed its new drug submission to the FDA for its Parkinson's disease psychosis drug Nuplazid. Yesterday, I explained that Acadia Pharmaceuticals' conference cancellations should not be seen as a M&A indication, but given this news, one thing I suggested definitely reigns true: Acadia needs a partner, badly. Acadia Pharmaceuticals needs serious help with Nuplazid. It simply can not get ready on its own with the preparations that the FDA requires to earn an FDA approval. Yes, the data is present to earn an FDA approval -- Nuplazid's Breakthrough designation pretty much confirms the data is good enough in the FDA's eyes -- but it's everything else that comes with the FDA approval territory that Acadia seems to be struggling with. For example, having an effective commercial manufacturing procedure in place to handle high supply is a must-have with the FDA before an approval is earned. Acadia must prove that it can handle the possible demand of the one million plus Parkinson's disease patients in the U.S. While Nuplazid will only treat patients with psychosis, there is no accurate measure of what percentage of PD patients suffer from psychosis; it could be as low as 20% or well over 50%. More than likely, Acadia must prove it can supply Nuplazid to the latter. What makes this even more difficult is that Acadia has continuously stated its preference to market Nuplazid alone, or at least that it's preparing to do so. It is clear that Acadia is having a hard time setting the procedure in place to guarantee supply of Nuplazid, which tells me that Acadia Pharmaceuticals desperately needs a third-party manufacturing or marketing partner. As I detailed in my very first Acadia Pharmaceuticals blog , there are more than a few companies that could find operating synergies with Acadia. These potential partners already have the commercial marketing and manufacturing infrastructure in place to handle a likely blockbuster drug like Nuplazid's demand. My question now becomes: Will Acadia seek a partner, and is its failure to secure a partner of sorts the reason that long-time CEO Uli Hacksel has decided to resign? Perhaps Hacksel and the board knew that promises were made that couldn't be kept. Rather than losing all future shareholder confidence, management decided it was best for Hacksel to move on. In my opinion this is good for Acadia shareholders, as it makes way for chief executive leadership that should realize the need Acadia currently has, and will pursue that need (partnership) in order to get Nuplazid on the market by answering these commercialization-related questions. All in all, the news on Wednesday does nothing to change my opinion or outlook on Acadia as a company or the stock. Certainly there is a bit more dysfunction than I'd like to see, but in realizing that this management team has never been outside of the clinical trial setting before now, I realize that such problems are not inexcusable. I still think that Nuplazid will achieve commercial success that exceeds current expectations and that Acadia will be a highly sought after acquisition target following Nuplazid's FDA approval. Investors now enter a waiting period for action to occur. While frustrating, it is very likely to create a better stock entry point along the way for long-term investors who see the upside.
