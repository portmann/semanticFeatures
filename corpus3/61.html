Bob Evans Is A Disappointment - Cramer's Lightning Round (3/4/15) | Seeking Alpha Mar.  5, 2015  6:09 AM ET  |  Includes: AVGO , BIG , BOBE , CY , DST , FSLR , GOGO , HON , NXPI , RL , SCTY , STM , SWKS , VFC by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Cramer prefers V.F. Corp. over Polo Ralph Lauren. STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ): "It's another one of the semis that I like. But let's remember the pecking order - I like Cypress Semi (NASDAQ: CY ), Avago (NASDAQ: AVGO ), Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ) and NXP Semi (NASDAQ: NXPI ) more than I like STM." Bob Evans Farms (NASDAQ: BOBE ): "I was very disappointed, this Bob Evans deal I was looking for a spin-off of the sausage business. I now think it is fully reflected. The most disappointing stock so far of 2015." SolarCity Corp. (NASDAQ: SCTY ): "If we want to do solar, we don't want to go SolarCity. We want to go to First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR ) which is doing that spin that's going to give us some yield." Gogo (NASDAQ: GOGO ): "I am worried about technological issues here because I think that Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) has a project. I'd rather be in other places." Big Lots (NYSE: BIG ): "I am not as big a fan of Big Lots. They do report this week, but it's had a big run. I'd be a little bit more cautious. I'm not there for that one." Polo Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL ): "I am not a fan of Ralph Lauren. It did not deliver. I prefer V.F. Corp. (NYSE: VFC ). That one is delivering."
