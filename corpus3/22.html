You're Gonna Like The Way Men's Wearhouse Looks In Your Portfolio - Men's Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE:MW) | Seeking Alpha As a favor to one of my groomsmen who just this morning asked me about investing in this company, I thought I would take a look at Men's Wearhouse. A discussion of its acquisition of Jos. A Bank, its transition issues, its performance and expected performance leads to a buy rating. Looking ahead, Menâ€™s Wearhouse is entering a new era and is going to be on the upswing of things with earnings that will likely more than double in 2 years. Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW ) is a retailer that I have had a lot of experience with as a consumer, and more specifically, as both a groom and a groomsmen several times. I have always had a pleasant experience but had generally purchased my non-formal wear suits elsewhere, including Jos. A. Bank. But now, they are one in the same as Men's Wearhouse has purchased the company. As a favor to one of my groomsmen who just this morning asked me about investing in this company, I thought I would take a look. At first glance the valuation is sky high. The p/e ratio exceeds 300, putting in the ranks of growth stocks I have long avoided (think Amazon). But momentum growth investments have worked and so I want to give this company a fair shake. From a fundamental standpoint, it is in a good position as a formal wear shop. The economy has strengthened in the last 5 years, more people are working, and believe it or not, people are still getting married. As a side note, with divorces being so common these days, the rate of second marriages has risen dramatically in the last 15 years. Further, we are about to enter wedding season and the next two quarters are key for the company. As a premier retailer and renter of wedding apparel, Men's Wearhouse is in a good position in history. I mentioned it bought Jos. A. Bank, a former large competitor. It also owns Moores and K&G and operates a successful corporate apparel segment. Let me first briefly address what I like about the Jos. A. Bank acquisition. First, it cleaved off a source of competition. That is always good. It's never easy to incorporate a takeover of this size, but it appears things are going smoothly, albeit slowly. It has been about 9 months since the acquisition and the company has worked to improved back office operations to produce synergy with its flagship Men's Wearhouse locations. Further it has now integrated the high margin tuxedo rental business into all of its Jos. A. Bank locations. But there is more work to be done. I expect 2015 to be a busy year for the transition, particularly around the internal inventory and sales systems, so that all data can be centrally housed. It's simply administratively easier, but a long process. Once complete, the company actually expects to see profits accelerate and see rebounding sales after a drought of a few years prior to and immediately post-acquisition. So the company seemingly has its ducks in row (I wanted to say Tux' in a row but refrained). The question is, as a potential investment, is the company performing? Well judging by its most recent quarter, I think it is performing. It delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines , with revenues of $928 million and a loss of just $0.03 per share. Further, net sales at its flagship stores, the Men's Wearhouse were up 8.4% versus Q4 2013. In fact these sales made up 41% of revenues. Further comparable sales increased 6.8%. The high margin tuxedo rental revenues also increased 5.7% in Q4 2014. So what about the new Jos. A. Bank purchases? Well these sales made up 36% of the total Q4 sales. However I was disappointed to see that comparable sales decreased 6.6%. It saw decreases in clothing product sales and average transactions per store. However this was partially offset by an increase in items sold per transaction. Some of this weakness however is temporary as it is associated with the transition. The company is still 'working out the kinks' for lack of a better term. Then there is Moores and K&G. Moores is the company's Canadian retail brand. It accounted for 6% of the Q4 sales and had a comparable sales increase of 8.6% while net sales increased 0.8% (would have been more but the US dollar strength is hurting it). As for K&G, sales here were 9% Q4 revenues. K&G saw a comparable sales increase of 6.8%. Finally its corporate apparel segment was a little weak, seeing sales decline 1.4% year-over-year. All in all however, I am pretty pleased with what I am seeing here. I expect the Jos. A. Bank weakness to dissipate as 2015 rolls on and the transition into the Men's Wearhouse umbrella nears completion. I mentioned that revenues beat expectations as sales were $928.4 million. While of course this now accounts for having Jos. A. Bank, net sales increased 65.6%, or $367.8 million year-over-year comparing Q4 2014 to Q4 2013. Retail segment sales for the quarter increased by 74.1%, or $368.7 million but $337.0 million of this increase was due to sales at Jos. A. Bank. What I am most excited about aside from the growth of the company and it entering a sweet spot economically is that its margins are strong. Adjusted consolidated gross margin was $363.3 million, an increase of $154.5 million or 74.0% compared to Q4 2013. What is more, the total adjusted gross margin rate increased 188 basis points. Further, adjusted retail segment gross margin increased $155.5 million, or 81.6% and its gross margin rate increased 164 basis points. This all led to a GAAP operating loss of $42.0 million compared to GAAP operating loss of $49.7 million last year. But I prefer to look at the adjusted numbers for the real picture. Adjusted operating income was $24.9 million, a substantial improvement to the adjusted operating loss of $30.8 million in Q4 2013. Looking ahead, I think Men's Wearhouse is entering a new era and is going to be on the upswing of things. The company has a sizable debt load of $1.7 billion but this is due almost entirely to the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank. Its inventories have now jumped to $938 million. I expect to see $2.75 in adjusted earnings in 2015, while the company is guiding to as high as $2.90. I think that with the Jos. A. Bank transition and an anticipated strong wedding season it can get here. My estimate would be about a 15% year-over-year improvement, demonstrating meaningful growth. Fast forward to 2017 and the company expects that year to see earnings of $5.75 to $6.25. That is a doubling of earnings. Folks, I think you will like the way Men's Wearhouse looks in your portfolio. It has the growth to support its valuation.
