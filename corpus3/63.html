FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE ): "I like FireEye, I like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW ). And I like CyberArk (NASDAQ: CYBR ) as well as Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT ). So let's call them the four horsemen." Discovery Communications (NASDAQ: DISCA ) (NASDAQ: DISCB ) (NASDAQ: DISCK ): "Short term I'm not a fan. Long term I am a fan because I think they can run those programs over and over again. That's my kind of business model." KKR (NYSE: KKR ): "I am sticking with it because there's a lot of value there and I like the yield. I think those guys are real good business people. I am not backing away from KKR which I have liked for a long time." World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE: WWE ): "WWE is making a comeback and yet I still don't see the business model generating the kind of cash that I like. I am going to be in the don't buy camp."
