Welcome to the Capstone Infrastructure Corporation Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2014 Results Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Aaron Boles, Senior Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Boles. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Capstone Infrastructure Corporation's financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Today's call will be hosted by Michael Bernstein, our Chief Executive Officer. And also on the call is Michael Smerdon, our Chief Financial Officer. Our News Release was issued after market closed yesterday and is available on our Web site at www.capstoneinfrastructure.com. Today's conference call is also being webcast live with accompanying slides and will be archived on our Web site along with a transcript of the event. Following management's remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. During the Q&A, we ask that you limit your questions to two before re-entering the queue to ensure everyone has the chance to participate. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, we may make various forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For information about these risks and uncertainties, I refer you to the MD&A and our Annual Report and our most recent Annual Information Form dated March 26, 2014. Both of which are available on our Web site. Thanks Aaron. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We had a very active 2014 at Capstone with achievements ranging from the successful financing construction and commissioning of new wind projects to securing Cardinal's future with a 20-year contract; to investing in and improving upon the performance of our operating portfolio. We also dedicated considerable time and effort helping the team at Bristol Water put together a detailed and thoroughly vetted business plan for the upcoming 5-year regulatory period only to be met with a disappointing final determination from the economic regulator Ofwat. This morning, I will go through each of these areas before turning the call over to our CFO, Mike Smerdon for a detailed review of the company's financial results and position. I will then conclude with discussion of what lies ahead for Capstone in 2015 before opening the phone lines to questions. Capstone's headline financial performance for 2014 was strong. We posted a 24.9% increase in adjusted EBITDA with $160.4 million for the year exceeding our forecast. This was the outcome of higher regulated customer rates and favorable currency exchange from Bristol Water, improved results from Cardinal and an additional dividend payment from VÃ¤rmevÃ¤rden, our district heating business in Sweden. In 2014, we also captured the benefits of a full year of contributions from Capstone's expanded wind power portfolio without the related acquisition and due diligence cost in incurred the year before. These factors were partially offset by higher interest in taxes paid but adjusted funds from operations still rose by 41.3% to $56.4 million. 2014 was Capstone's 10th anniversary and we made significant advances on a number of fronts. First, we extended the life of the first asset we ever owned Cardinal by signing a new 20-year non-utility generator contract with the Ontario Power Authority, which is since January 1, amalgamated with the independent electricity system operator. This agreement came into force on January 1st of this year and provides Cardinal with a six-monthly payment escalating annually according to a pre-defined formula while enabling the facility's supply power to the Ontario Grid, when needed. In December, we also signed a new energy savings agreement with land lease with Ingredion, the company that owns the land on which Cardinal is situated. And this spring, we will complete a $30 million refurbishment and life extension for the facility. Second, we realized the benefits of the 2013 acquisition of renewable energy developers not only did we gain from the higher revenue associated with a larger operating portfolio, we were able to demonstrate our capability to execute on development projects. The 10-megawatt Skyway 8 project reached COD in August of 2014 on time and under budget, construction was completed on the 24-megawatt Saint-PhilÃ©mon facility by the end of 2014 when this site was commissioned on January 16 of this year and towers have now began to rise on the 25-megawatt Goulais site and we expected to achieve COD in the second quarter of 2015. The next phase of organic growth has also begun with renewable energy approvals now secured for the 10-megawatt Grey Highlands ZEP and the 17.5-megawatt Ganaraska projects. Those developments will now proceed to the Environmental Review Tribunal, which is anticipated to take 6 months after which we plan for construction to begin. In the meantime, we expect to receive renewable energy approvals for three other Ontario based projects in the first half of 2015. The 10-megawatt Riverhurst project in Saskatchewan is now proceeding through a revised interconnection assessment process with SaskPower and we anticipate or commence construction in 2016. Third, we continued to look after and invest in our operating assets, the Whitecourt biomass facility is now operating as a market participant in the Alberta Power Pool. We recently signed a new 15-year agreement with Millar Western, the fuel supplier for Whitecourt and this includes mechanisms to ensure economic base load operations. The agreement embeds the possibility to extend the contract to 20 years. The plant was also recognized again under the Canadian federal government's eco-logo program, which is the largest and most respected environmental certification program in North America. Availability for the year stood at 96.4%. Erie Shores, we complemented the existing wind boost program, a software tool that has increased output with turbine pitch optimization technology that is expected to increase production up to 1.5%. This technology may prove useful at our other wind facilities as well. Across our operating wind portfolio, we achieved the availability of 97.3% during the year, which was slightly higher than in 2013. Availability at Amherstburg Solar Park was 98.6% and our hydro facilities posted 96.4% availability both of which are modestly lower than the year before. Before I turn things over to Mike Smerdon, I will take a moment to update the situation of Bristol Water. The final determination we received on December 12, 2014 from Ofwat, the economic regulator for the water industry in the United Kingdom was a serious disappointment for Bristol Water and for us at Capstone. As we outlined in our 2015 forecast and conference call in December, a great deal of effort and diligence went into preparing a business plan that met the stated interest of customers and the parameters originally set out by Ofwat for the 2015 to 2020 regulatory period. There were several major points of difference between Bristol Water's proposed business plan and Ofwat's final determination, which we believe post serious challenges to maintaining service levels and investing in [improvement customer-supported] [ph]. Bristol Water's Board of Directors unanimously resolved on February 5, to formally reject Ofwat's final determination. The business plan will now proceed to review by the Competition and Markets Authority or CMA, the U.K. agency responsible for considering regulatory references and appeals. The review process is expected to conclude in six months in accordance with a prescribed statutory timetable. We are confident that we will secure an improved outcome following the CMA review, which was a case in 2010, when Bristol Water went to a similar process. On February 6, the Bond Rating agency Moody's stated it was â€œA realistic prospect to expect a better result through an appeal and maintained Bristol Water's credit rating albeit with a note of caution.â€? Thanks Mike. We have already covered adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for 2014, so I will discuss Capstone's revenue, expenses and capital position. Capstone's full year 2014 revenue was higher by 13.4% to $441.6 million driven by three prevailing factors. An increase in Bristol Water's regulated tariffs and higher water consumption resulted in gains of 5.3%. Bristol Water contributed 16.7% more because of the favorable foreign currency translation and the power segment posted a 4.8% gain in revenue because of higher production in Amherstburg and Erie Shores, a full year of contributions from assets acquired in 2013 and a partial year contribution from the new Skyway 8 facility. These gains were partially offset by lower production at Cardinal and reduced Alberta Power Pool prices affecting Whitecourt. Expenses rose 2.8% to $226.5 million for the full year consisting of the effective foreign currency exchange rates on Bristol Waters operating expenses, higher cost related to Capstone's larger operating power portfolio including staffing costs and fees related to integrating the acquired assets. And the cost associated with the 2013 acquisition itself were absent in 2014, which helped to offset higher expenses in other areas. A note about Cardinal's current $30 million refurbishment and life extension much of this work is priced in U.S. dollars although we have hedged our exposure had an exchange rate of $0.89. At the end of 2014, Capstone held $58.8 million of cash and equivalents including $33 million from the power segment and $13 million from Bristol Water. About $27 million of our total cash and equivalents along with approximately $41 million of undrawn revolver capacity is available for general corporate purposes. Our long-term debt at year-end was approximately $895 million on a fair value basis. That includes debt at corporate and our proportionate share of debt at the power assets as well as Bristol Water. Capstone's debt to capitalization ratio was 71.2% on a fair value basis, which reflects the company's lower share price at year-end and a higher fair value for debt as interest rates declined and the impact of a stronger British pound was reflected on our balance sheet. At our power facilities 97.8% of the debt is secured at the asset level is non-recourse to Capstone and is scheduled to fully amortize over the life of each operating business. This includes $158 million in project level financing completed in 2014 to fund the three wind projects Mike spoke about. The project financing relate to the Skyway 8 was successfully converted in February from its construction phase to the term-loan phase at an interest rate of 4.8%. Debt at Bristol Water is similarly long-term with 77.5% sharing maturities longer than 10 years. Bristol Water is on track to fully complete its $546 million capital investment program by March 31, 2015 funded with internally generated cash flow and existing credit capacity while continuing to pay dividends through shareholders throughout [FY 2015] [ph]. The foreign currency exchange rate for the British pound for the Canadian dollar is currently 6.5% above last year's average rate. This will help Bristol Water's contribution to Capstone this year although it may have the after corresponding effect of raising our debt to capitalization ratio holding all else constant. In asset write-down related to Erie Shores was included in the annual results which deserve some context. The impairment relate exclusively to assumptions about prevailing market price for power 11.5 years from now when the PPA expires. The expected future power prices in 2027 and beyond are lower than previously expected primarily as a result of the low current power prices in Ontario. Obviously, expectations about power prices that far in the distance are subject to change and maybe higher depending on what happens with the nuclear fleet, evaluation of a capacity market in Ontario, gas prices as well as other factors. In terms of outlook, we reiterate that 2015 adjusted EBITDA our target we published in our fiscal 2015 forecast last December between $115 million and $125 million. This outlook is based on a higher contribution from our growing portfolio of wind power generation businesses, a lower contribution from Cardinal under its new contract and a return to normal dividends from our district heating utility. It also reflects the Bristol Water will operate under the final determination issued by Ofwat starting on April 1 of 2015. The regulatory hurdles of Bristol Water figured prominently in late 2014. I would like to refer to what we covered in our forecast about the impact of Bristol Water and Capstone's financial picture. The implementation of the new business plan at Bristol Water will result in a 14% real reduction in rates for Bristol's fiscal year which ends March 2016. The CMA review will be underway shortly with an expected resolution in six months time. If as we expect that process yields an improved business plan, a new pricing structure would commence from April of 2016. Regardless of the outcome of the CMA review, as we demonstrated in our forecast in December, Capstone has sufficient cash and credit resources to cover all of the wind projects, Cardinal's capital expenditures, corporate costs, debt service and dividends on our preferred and common shares while still leaving us with cash and revolver capacity until 2017, which is the year in which we expect to hit our run rate. As we stated in December, we have no plans to change Capstone's dividend policy. Capstone's financial position is sound, we are developing new income streams with successful execution of our wind projects; our existing businesses are well-managed and continued to generate reliable cash flow and we have the financial position, capital structure and relationships to capture growth opportunities. Thanks Mike. Infrastructure is a highly desirable sector, every year an increasing number of retail and institutional investors seek to enter this market and expand their holdings in it. Infrastructure assets are essential to the modern global economy, returns in the sector tend to be stable and maintain inflation and barriers to entry are high. We believe in the current attractiveness and compelling future potential of this asset class. Like anything else infrastructure also has its challenges. We saw that at Capstone with the Bristol Water regulatory outcome. We can also see it in the intense competition for assets. A number of potential acquisitions were thoroughly considered during 2014 either in our existing pillars or new areas like public-private partnerships in transportation. This process let to new relationships in promising areas for future opportunities, so we did not consummate a deal. We realized that our fellow shareholders are eager to see growth and are committed to seizing opportunities to grow and increase value. We are also mindful of the disciplined and prudent approach that has created the high-quality portfolio Capstone holds to-date. In the meantime, organic growth continues at a brisk pace. Our wind developments are being executed on time and in some cases under budget, we received REAs for two new wind projects with more expected soon and Capstone has qualified under Ontario's LRP program and we are actively evaluating potential submissions under this framework. Bristol Water as we have said, we expect an improved outcome from the CMA review. While we also know that this is an excellent perpetual asset with tremendous long-term growth prospects. In fact, all the assets in Capstone's utilities and power portfolio are well-managed and virtually all have long-term power purchase or fuel supply agreement. We have an excellent visibility on Capstone's long-term cash flow horizon and we affirmed our commitment to Capstone's dividend policy. Our near-term hurdle with Bristol Water has lately obscured the inherent value of our businesses as a whole. Candidly, it's our view that Capstone's market capitalization today doesn't capture the full worth of the company's component parts. We intend to emphasize our strength including the excellent results we posted in fiscal 2015 in ordered value of our portfolio and current perception. It is just over 2 months into the New Year, for the balance of 2015 our priorities will be to responsibly manage our operating portfolio, successfully complete our development projects, pursue approvals for a mid-term wind pipeline, secure an improved outcome for Bristol Water and evaluate and close on potential acquisitions. To all of this, we will be focused on our vision to be a Canadian leader in owning and operating diversified infrastructure businesses that benefit the communities we serve, the people we employ and importantly our investors. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is Jeremy Mersereau with National Bank Financial. Please go ahead. You did talk briefly about the regulatory approvals and permits for the wind development projects. I was wondering if you could walk us through any changes you have seen â€“ have any timeline change as well? While there's certainly been a long process than [indiscernible] the program for getting the REAs, which has obviously captured us. Everything we have seen from the ERT process is that they still stick to roughly the 6-month period including that some may come before that. So as you know, there has been a number of appeals and we have [unfortunate] [ph] appeals, I think none of them has been up held. There was one that was successful, but then the project was able to go forward on appeal. So the main difference we have seen is just the lengthy time on the REA process and what I can say there is that the government has, I guess updated and refined the amount of information they are requesting at this stage than they were at the earlier parts couple of years ago and I think that just reflecting more information and more request from stakeholders. Okay. And at Whitecourt, just wondering if you could comment on the types of risk sharing mechanisms you have and for the new fuel agreement, is it skewed for downward protection for you for instance or on power pricing, could you may be elaborate? Yes. What is mutually beneficial for both Millar Western is that we run base load and burn all of the wood waste as possible in an environmentally friendly manner. And we obviously want to do that when market prices and the economics are good. Unfortunately with the current power pool prices in Alberta being lower then we need a certain amount of revenues to be able to continue to run base load. And frankly, we prefer operating base load anyway it's easier to run the facility that way. So what we have done is as we have signed a new 15-year-old wood waste supply agreement that can be extended to 20 years and that includes provisions that provides a mechanism as you say we call it a floor to preserve our economics to run base load at the same time we do have mechanisms to share power pool prices get to be â€“ or above a certain level. Just to follow-up on Jeremy's question on Whitecourt, so when you mentioned the downside protection for power prices, so are they effectively subsidizing your price at current levels, I just originally thought that you effectively get the supply for free and your all end operating costs for Whitecourt is kind of in the $60 range. So I was just wondering how the economics work when power prices are in the $40 range? Yes. As it's a private company, I want to be careful of confidentialities, but it is a scenario that if you will that you can think about it that we do get the wood waste for fuel for free or depending on what power pool prices, so that it remains economic that are essentially there might be transfers of payments one way or the other depending on where power pool prices are going. So it is a case that we will be operating profitably in all the scenarios. And Nelson I think you got the â€“ Whitecourt is not â€“ is profitable level below 60. I think if you look at power pool prices in the $40 to $45 range that sort of breakeven for Whitecourt under an average year. Yes. As I think it might be kind of maybe not all fixed cost included, but on a variable cost basis, it's probably closer to $30 range and that might have been when diesel costs because one of our cost are trucking is higher. So I haven't seen that an update to figure based on where oil prices are now, but our marginal costs are more in the $30 range. I see, okay. And then switching gears a bit, in terms of the overhead costs for Q4, I think the wages and benefits item appears to be a lot lower than the run rate, was there a reversal recognized in Q4? Yes. There is â€“ [indiscernible] talk about, the share price at year-end was obviously significantly lower than it has been earlier in the year. A portion of staff compensation is in the form of long-term incentive plans, which are restricted share units and performance share units. The performance share â€“ there is two components, so to the reversal of the accrual that happened in Q4. Performance share units for staff that vested on December 31, vested at a zero multiplier, so there is no payout to staff on those even though accruals have been made earlier in the year. And then obviously the lower share price meant that the liability for the corporation are unvested long-term incentive plan shares is also lower. So it's largely those two factors. I see, okay. And then just one last question, in terms of future M&A, can you talk about your capacity to do more projects. And then also, I think in the past you are looking at general infrastructure in P3s, can you talk about how the pricing in the market is and whether you would look to buy an existing asset or an asset that's underdevelopment? Oh, capacity for M&A and we talked about the cash available and the current available on the balance sheet is around $70 million in total. Of that about $30 million would be earmarked for the remaining wind power projects and a little bit for Cardinal. In terms of what you see at year end, we had some additional receivables balance at year end because we had a payment that was coming in for Cardinal. So the cash balance at year end is not really reflective of the cash that we have today. So as you know, we are accruing a receivable on Cardinal over the course of Q2 through Q4, which was paid. There was about $13 million or $14 million that we got in January. So if you include that we got a little over $75 million to spend, $30 million for the wind portfolio a little bit left to spend to finish up the Cardinal CapEx, so residual amount in around the $30 million level for other projects. Plus we do have Cardinal which was under 20-year contract would be unlevered like Cardinal with the new fuel supply agreement again it's unlevered. So there is probably some capacity at the asset level though as Mike is saying particularly between now and Bristol Water we have some liquidity in capital to fund smaller type of acquisitions. On your other question, I think the P3 market we looked at the couple of things primarily on the operating side, I think the â€“ with a little bit as a theme in the discussion high-quality assets are going through pretty high prices. So returns are probably in our mind what we are seeing is probably coming down 100 to 200 basis points over the last year or so in that sector. There could potential be some value, but not as much as â€“ as it might have been the case a couple of years ago as the market mature. Therefore we are kind of thinking about more â€“ a little bit as we did on the power side looking at the earlier stages and partnering at the development side and that might be longer term but frankly more lucrative for us and our shareholders because from a risk-adjusted return basis that might prove more compelling. I think on the power side on the operating side same theme continues, which is operating assets particularly with the yield goes out there, our bidding extremely aggressively for the assets, which is why we focused our attention on the development side. Couple of questions, it sounds like you have brought in some help on the P3 side, can you give us a little bit more context who you brought in and experience in the sector that sort of thing? Yes. Couple of things. One is we do have experience at Capstone team already on the P3 side. So we have everyone from Mike Smerdon, who helped want to see this tied together way back when and even 407, when you are a young lad and Jack as well as myself. So a lot of our team from the first P3 project in Quebec to see this High Edmonton Ring Road. So our team has it, but frankly we have been busy dealing with other things, so what we did last March was we brought in a gentlemen by the name of Anthony Ferrari, who both working within government as well as a consultant as well as with a smaller infrastructure fund had all great contacts and experience on the P3 side. So what he has been doing over the last â€“ almost a year now is making sure that both the operators of existing assets but as well as developers are very aware of our interest and our experience in the sector, how we can be very complementary to them. And based on that we have had, I will say very encouraging conversations but yet no deals to announce. Okay. And on the renewables, I guess perspective development side, can you give us context if you are looking at anything beyond Ontario has the scope in terms of regional potential change for you guys? If you want to kind of cross-country or across the continent perspective, I think the U.S. particularly on the wind and solar side are much more challenging because of the yield curves. So couple of years ago, we thought that might be more fertile territory to chase. But the yield curves are very much impacting that. On the positive side, I think the tax equity component is one that has worked out a couple, but its kink, so some of that structure can potentially prove attractive. But, in the U.S. we are looking more at gas as an opportunity for growth and a couple of things that we are actively evaluating right now. So that's on the â€“ I will say from the U.S. and development side. Across Canada, we are taking a look at the LRP in Ontario; we do have some potential to expand the Erie Shores. To be honest though, we are a little bit concerned about â€“ from the pricing that happened in Quebec, you had â€“ I'm trying to remember now was several thousand megawatts bidding for a couple of hundred and the pricing was quite low. Now, what's different about Ontario is that you got mechanisms like community support and some softer factors, which can essentially equalize pricing and therefore, some of the softer factors can still allow projects that we think are being bid and proper returns to be evaluated on the equal footing. And as you know areas like Erie Shores â€“ our community is very, very accepting of Erie Shores. But, right now in Quebec, what we see another lull, there maybe a better thing happening out in the east, but we don't see that as a very active market. I think Saskatchewan may do another call and then we will see whether there is potential to build on our one project that we have in works there. And let's look at that budget that will happen in Alberta. The government is talking a lot about climate change. There maybe some interesting development from what they may do around coal, so Alberta right now is a merchant market, it doesn't work in our mines. But there maybe new programs that they may want to announce over the summer that could be attractive. And BC you have small things like the standard offer programs and potentially even though with the announcement some continuing focus on the IPP market, but I won't say very robust. So I mean overall, nowhere close to the level of activity we have seen over the last of couple years, but particularly we picked the right pockets and in our mind look at the U.S. on the gas side. There are good opportunities there. On Bristol Water, there was commentary about cost reductions that you plan to implement during the CMA arbitration, can you talk a bit more about what reductions you are looking at specifically and when you â€“ when you think about your guidance, to what extent did these cost reductions mitigate that 14% decline in revenues? I will talk about the first part; Mike can cover the second part. So a little bit as we did in the last period as we consistently looked to improve our efficiency in productivity. So we had a program called Avon Plus that we implemented in the last regulatory period as this is ramping up now reasonably successfully, as part of, I will say two things, one is always looking to be more efficient and create better value for your customers, but two, there is a bit of evolving market in the U.K. with retail competition and eventually upstream wholesale, I won't call competition, but looking at asset. We are looking to one, make sure the organization is properly structured as we look at larger projects things like [charter] [ph] and resilience schemes, but also that we continue to make sure that we run our operations as efficiently as possible. So that includes everything from IT to how we manage our work force to how we procure our assets and as part of our business plan submission, roughly we had about, I will call it 10% efficiency target built into our submission to Ofwat, which I will say is one that we think is achievable, but is one also that we have to deliver on. So those are some of the initiatives that we have already had planned and had done a lot of work on over the last year-end change putting together a business plan, which is what we submitted to Ofwat. As you know Ofwat right now is saying that we should be spending a much, much less money overall in the system much as on operations but on maintenance. But, what we have vetted is some those productivity improvements for running the system. I mean the cost efficiency program that Bristol Water is implementing isn't â€“ when you implement these sorts of plans as I have been involved within different businesses over the course of the last 10 to 15 years. You don't normally get a full impact on day one; there are usually things that you will take months if not a year or two to get the full benefit of. So no significant positive impact â€“ partial impact in 2015 although we will recall that for Bristol Water, their fiscal year and at the beginning of Amp 6 is already one quarter away into our fiscal year. So again, the limited impact in that respect. So the cost savings will be faced in over a period and but they â€“ they will make a dent in 14% reduction about 14% reduction in rates is too big to recapture simply through cost efficiency measures which is why we are pursuing CMA process. The most substantial part of that was the impairment charge that we took at Erie Shores. We mentioned in the call that the impairment is purely related to our â€“ an updated forecast we obtained in relation to the market rate for power after our PPA expires in 2026. So impairments in no way reflects what we expect to get in terms of EBITDA or AFFO over the next 11.5 years, but it does impact the our current view, subject to change as the power markets in Ontario evolve. But our current view on post-PPA cash flows in 2027 and beyond. There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bernstein for closing comments. Okay. Well, thank you everyone for joining us this morning. And for those who may have March break over the next couple of weeks and enjoy March break with friends and family. Take care.
