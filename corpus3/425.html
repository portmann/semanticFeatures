10 Thursday AM Reads | The Big Picture Have I mentioned how much I hate daylight savings time? Its why your morning train reads from your never-uses-an-alarm-clock author are late: â€¢ What a Great Time To Be An Investor! ( Meb Faber ) â€¢Â A Dozen Things I’ve Learned from David Tepper about Investing ( 25iq ) â€¢Â Adam Nash: Broken Values & Bottom Lines ( Medium )Â but seeÂ Response to Blog by Wealthfront CEO Adam Nash ( Schwab ) “I come not to bury bonuses, but to praise them” ? Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance, unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge. Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied. If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant, off topic discussions, it would be appreciated. Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous. http://www.wsj.com/articles/boj-helps-tokyo-stocks-to-soar-1426065432 “The Bank of Japan has bought ETFs on 143 days since April, 2013, mainly when the stock market has been down”. If you don’t believe other central banks aren’t using financial engineering to do the same then I have some prime Florida swampland to sell you. Can we finally stop calling these markets now?  More accurate to call them what they really are:  blatantly manipulated farces.  I mean, how much more evidence do people need?  Every time I read the word “market” in an article I’m being lied to. Solar is really making the power companies nervous.  With costs for solar dropping some 80% in the last six years, and installed capacity increasing at 30% plus a year or so power companies should be nervous.  As with most monopolies power companies first efforts is to pass laws that put the hurt solar power .  Their efforts have been “successful” in a few States. But the power companies are fighting a loosing battle.  The hand writing is on the wall. http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Can-Utilities-Survive-21st-Century-Energy-Market.html “In 2014, the U.S. installed 6.2 gigawatts of new solar power, a 30 percent jump over the year before. While that may not seem like much, the trend is clear: solar was second only to natural gas in terms of newly added capacity in 2014. The same will continue in 2015. Greentech Media predicts another 8.1 gigawatts in 2015, an additional 59 percent jump from 2014.” Storage is also a big part of the picture.  There is a lot of activity going on in storage from self motivated inventors in home garage  to some rather huge projects.  Storage is behind generation as far as real practical usefulness but it is taking shape. DST is an example of how politicians are scientifically illiterate.  It does nothing but disrupt. It saves nothing.  It is useless. Can we get rid of it? Here is an interesting analysis of a Schwab robo-advisor portfolio that does not focus on the cash kerfuffle (which I think is a tempest in a teapot). The conclusion from this analysis is that the Schwab portfolios are very focused on small cap and that is their big distinction from much of the rest of the field. http://www.etf.com/sections/blog/schwab-intelligent-portfolios-x-ray?nopaging=1 This article notes that Schwab uses Schwab ETFs instead of Vanguard ones. However, they do not point out that Schwab doesn’t charge transaction fees on Schwab ETFs and mutual funds, but they do charge brokerage transaction fees for Vanguard (and many other) ETFs. So trading the Schwab funds in initial purchases, redemptions, and rebalancing will be free unlike many other robo-advisors. Since Schwab ETFs and mutual funds generally have pretty low expense ratios compared to equivalent funds, that seems like a reasonable deal. Keep in mind that nothing will have a lower expense ratio than a Vanguard all-in-one fund to achieve a reasonable diversified portfolio. BTW – I have been completely baffled by the focus on Schwab’s use of cash as being immoral because they might make money on it through their bank. The biggest single issue for mutual fund investors over the past half-century is that the investment companies have had high expenses and fees for their stock and bond funds investors. If anything, the fact that cash could otherwise be put into a Schwab ETF with higher fees than the money market account would have been a more reasonable “complaint”. With the small cap focus, the cash may make more sense to reduce volatility and get more bang in rebalancing during market ups and downs. I think most of the robo-advisor market is going to be tax-sheltered accounts, so the major tooth-gnashing over the tax implications of holding cash is generally going to be meaningless. If anything, preferentially holding interest bearing things in tax-sheltered accounts, even if taxed when the money comes out at the end, is preferential to holding them outside the account. So a  retiree holding cash in their tax-sheltered account where they can choose when it will be taxed while potentially holding a more stock heavy account in a non-sheltered account could make a lot of sense depending on individual circumstance. http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2014/06/12/michael-jordan-is-a-billionaire-after-increasing-stake-in-hornets/ Barry , my home state of Texas is looking into not change time at all, they are calling it “Texas Time”, which i think will be the current daylight saving time. http://www.ets.org/s/research/30079/index.html Studies show that “8.5 years living in a democracy will result in increased levels of support”. What does is say about America’s 248 year experiment? Ritholtz has been observing capital markets with a critical eye for 20 years.
