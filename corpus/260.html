Alcobra Drug Shows Little Effect After 1 Dose - Alcobra Ltd. (NASDAQ:ADHD) | Seeking Alpha The first study on kids demonstrated the safety of Alcobra's lone product candidate, but little else. The drug needs more testing, and management seemed to indicate their willingness to do so. Alcobra (NASDAQ: ADHD ), a pharmaceutical company developing one drug, metadoxine extended release (MDX), to treat various cognitive disorders. Today, Alcobra announced disappointing topline results from the AL015, the first pediatric trial of MDX in adolescent ADHD, which caused a drop of 17% in the pre-market. AL015, conducted in 82 adolescent ages 13-18, was a Phase II single-dose pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability study. Because it was mainly a safety trial, MDX did achieve its primary endpoint. MDX showed good tolerability, adverse events (AEs) from MDX were not different from placebo, and there was no discontinuation due to AEs. However, secondary cognitive measures as assessed by version 8 of the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) were not statistically significant. TOVA is a computer-based assessment of inattention more than 20 minutes in duration, which is long enough to effectively measure attention deficits in older children. In the first half of the test, patients have to persevere in a boring and fatiguing task, while in the second half the patients expect to respond, but have to curb that tendency at times. "Efficacy signals" were only seen on two of the TOVA variables, Response Time (measuring delay in response time after the appropriate stimulus is displayed) and Errors of Omission (patient fails to respond to the stimulus). Other variables include Errors of Commission (patient responds to an inappropriate stimulus) and Response Variability (consistency between all response times for the patient). Of course, these are early data after just one MDX dose, and further testing may identify potential doses or subpopulations of pediatric ADHD patients with which MDX may be more effective. Management appeared encouraged to " advance into efficacy trials of MDX for pediatric ADHD ." The speed at which they move forward with multiple-dose testing could demonstrate their remaining confidence (or lack thereof) in MDX in the pediatric setting. For the moment, AL015 joins AL012 and AL008 as trials with less than optimal results , which doesn't bode well for AL016, the second adult ADHD Phase III study that Alcobra anticipates launching in Q2. AL015 should not have any bearing on AL014, the Phase IIb Fragile X Syndrome study, which is on track to have outcomes reported in Q2 2015.
