Patent Concerns For This Japanese Conglomerate May Represent Buy Opportunity - Otsuka Holdings Co. Ltd. (OTCMKTS:OTSKF) | Seeking Alpha Over estimated impact of patent expiry on major product line. Expect pullback in stock price in April. Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd (OTCPK: OTSKF ). is a Japan-based pharmaceutical holding company engaged in four business segments. The Medical-related segment is engaged in the sale of ethical drugs, the manufacture, sale and export of curative medicines, and the research and development of infusions. The Nutraceuticals-related segment is engaged in the manufacture, purchase and sale of products such as functional foods and dietary supplements. The consumer-related segment is makes and sells various consumer products and mineral water. The fourth segment makes and sells chemical products, synthetic resin molding products, measuring equipment and packaging products, and handles the company's logistics. At March 31, 2014, the Company had 131 subsidiaries and 34 associated companies. We are currently developing a screener that will help select companies based on criteria suggested by the father of value investing, Benjamin Graham. While it is still in beta mode and not yet ready to add to the terminal just yet, we ran the 10 pre-defined (strict Graham) criteria on the companies in the database, and Otsuka was the only company that matched all 10. This suggested that Otsuka deserved further attention, and after analysis of the figures and business model, we felt that our customers might well be interested in this company. All figures are trending in the right direction. 5 year revenue growth (8%) is more than double the current industry average of 3.02%, and operating income growth (19%) is more than 3x the industry average of 6.28%. As with the income statement, the cash flow paints a healthy picture. Cash from operations is increasing, indicating that they are growing the business. This has been financed without issuing debt - in fact considerable amounts of debt have been repaid, though the repayment rate has slowed from the 2010-2011 peaks.. Over the last five years, capex has slightly exceeded deprecation, which is the right way round, and of late capex has been considerably higher than depreciation. There has been one round of raising cash from the issuance of stock, but the shares outstanding have only grown at an average of 4% per year since 2010. At the same time cash reserves at the end of 2014 are 25% higher than at the end of 2010. All this suggests that growth has been internally funded, and that Otsuka have found the magic formula of growing shareholder equity without having to raise capital through borrowing or issuance of shares. Current assets make up over 50% of total assets in 2014, and of those cash and accounts receivable account for 74% of total current assets. Current assets include an entry for "doubtful receivables", a welcome sign of accounting transparency; fortunately for shareholders this figure amounts to 540m JPY, which is just 1% of cash in the bank. This suggests that they have a strong, long term relationship with their customers. Buildings make up 17% of total assets. This is a reasonably low number, Otsuka are not in the real estate business and fluctuations in fair value of buildings can often have an unfair influence on the balance sheet and net profit. Goodwill is increasing, because they are 'buying' some of their growth via acquisitions. While we are not keen on acquisitions for acquisitions' sake, established pharmaceutical companies often find it cheaper to buy smaller drug companies than develop new drugs themselves; they pay a premium, but are assured that what they buy are marketable products with a reasonable commercial life, and meanwhile they mitigate the risks of paying for unproductive research. In 2014, of the 70B JPY that they record as goodwill, 41B (58%) is credited to the pharmaceutical arm of the business and 27B (38%) to the nutraceuticals. The company amortizes goodwill over 5-20 years; this vagueness, while understandable, could do with more explanation in the accounts, but we assume that the time frame reflects patent expiry dates and similar considerations. Goodwill only represents 3.4% of total assets and the book value per share minus goodwill shows a healthy 2,653 JPY, so we do not see the goodwill numbers as a potential risk to shareholders. Long term debt has decreased by over a third over the previous 3 years, and the debt to equity ratio is at a very safe 1.3%. Otsuka are generating more than enough cash to cover any fluctuations in interest rates. The P/E ratio has remained steadily in the 11-15 range. The ratio today is 12.90, well below the industry average of 29.32. The dividend payout ratio, at a healthy 23%, suggests that the dividend is sustainable and that there is room for it to increase in line with new profit in the future. Importantly, margins are increasing: the growing net profit margins suggest constantly improving efficiency. Return on assets and return on total capital employed are also increasing. Otsuka reported on the 13th of February 2015, showing that the net asset value per share is roughly 75% of the value of the share price (JPY 2,782 vs. JPY 3,602). It is unusual to find a well-run pharmaceutical company in this situation, suggesting either that we are missing something, or that Otsuka is by no means overvalued by the market. The next sections suggest one reason for the relative shyness investors feel towards the stock, and analyze what the company has been, and is, doing about it. Pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals make up the vast majority of turnover, so it is important that there is a sustainable business plan to drive future growth. By far their biggest seller is the drug Abilify , which is used to treat adult depression and bi polar disease, as the pharmaceuticals division breakdown shows: Abilify accounted for 57% of total drug sales and 41% of total revenue. The patent for Abilify expires in April 2015 , so there is a major reason for investor caution. Ostuka have done well to minimize the impact of generic erosion by encouraging physicians to use Abilify as their "go to" choice of drug. However, according to their FY2015 forecasts, Otsuka are predicting sales of the drug to decrease from JYP 51B in 2014, to 40B, leaving a JPY 11B ($92M) gap to be plugged. Fortunately, Otsuka have already implemented a plan to fill this gap by acquiring Avanir Pharmacueticals in December 2014 for and all cash deal worth $3.5B. Avanir is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in CNS diseases, and most importantly developed and launched Nuedexta, the world's first and only approved treatment for the neurologic disease pseudobulbar affect. This is an extremely high growth product: sales in the US jumped 50% in 2013 to 2014 (from $63m to $94m). CNS therapy is one of the company's prioritized areas, and this acquisition will serve as a short term and mid-term growth driver, with revenues from the drug starting to contribute to Otsuaka's bottom line from 2015, as well as allowing them access to the relevant R&D to develop new products in that area. On top of acquisitions, Otsuka plans to build sustainable growth by launching 3 new next generation drugs (Lonsurf, Lu AE58054 and SGI-110), 3 new global drugs (Abilify Maintena, Brexpiprazole and Tolvaptan) and what it refers to in its forecast report as "new drugs in Japan" - although this statement is not backed up by any more details. Out of these products, 80% are already filed and ready to be launched this year, and they estimate that these products will bring in an additional JPY 515B ($4.3B) in 2018 (total sales in 2014 across all products was JPY 15T). Neutraceuticals is an interesting, high growth area, sales in Asia and EU were up 16.8% from the previous year, and sales in the US were up 11.4%; but domestic sales were down 9%, so it is not all good news. The three core product lines are, Pocari Sweat , a fluid replacement drink, Jasmine branded gluten free, organic and diabetic foods manufactured by the large Brazilian health company they acquired in 2014, and Foodstate dietary supplements. Focused investments in Indonesia and China (driver Pocari Sweat) Active investment in the EU in growing markets such as gluten-free and soy products Supplement industry in the US (Nature Made) Japan - "reviewing business assets through fostering new products" It is natural for a company to be rather coy about the details of such plans in public-domain documents, and we really only have management-speak stuff about them. We suspect that the company will rely both on organic growth and additional acquisitions. The "focused investments" in the growing consumer markets of Indonesia and China, for example, may simply mean "big marketing push" - not a bad thing in itself.. However the important point is that these "nutraceutical" markets are high growth . For example, global gluten-free food sales grew 63% from 2012-2014, with a global value of $8.8B. 22% of Americans now follow a gluten free diet, up from 15% in 2013. The global market for natural supplements is even more attractive, forecast to grow to $107B by 2017, with a CAGR of 9.15%. With these new acquisitions, Otsuka has positioned itself to become a "nutraceutical" market leader. According to their internal forecasts, Otsuka believe that sales will decrease in 2015 to JPY 13.7T. This sentiment is also echoed by other analysts. (source: Otsuka 2015 business plan and Reuters ) As we have seen above, the company is taking, and has already taken, very positive steps to plug the Abilify revenue gap. But the forecasts above, coupled with general anxiety about the company's current dependence on a single product for so much of its revenue and income, show why the stock is not finding much favor at present. This may well provide an opportunity to buy into Otsuka's future growth at a fair price, if the plans they have made come to fruition. The Nikkei 225 has been undergoing a strong bullish run over the past 12 months, pushing it to 15 year highs. Cheap oil and a weak Japanese Yen have catapulted Japanese export growth by 17% from a year earlier (source: Bloomberg ), while imports have fallen, narrowing the trade deficit to record lows. Over the same 12 month period, Otsuka has underperformed against the Nikkei 225, by 10% (see chart below). Over the past 30 days the Nikkei has shot up around 6-7%, but Otsuka has not shared in the rise. All bull runs must eventually come to an end and of course investors need to be aware of the risks involved when buying 'at the top of the market'. There inevitably will be a pull back of the Nikkei as investors lock in gains somewhere down the line. It is up to investors, who find the stock attractive, to decide whether to wait for the pull back to buy, or whether Otsuka's disconnect from the main Nikkei 225 trend, for the reasons suggested above, offers a current buying opportunity. Our principals are going to wait for a pullback; we could well be wrong, and we don't think it is an easy call. But Otskua is on our buy list one way or another.
