3D Is Not The Place To Be - Cramer's Lightning Round (3/5/15) | Seeking Alpha Control4 Corp. (NASDAQ: CTRL ): "It is software for home entertainment, it is like no man! It's hard enough to be Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ). I don't want a Control4." Ziopharm Oncology (NASDAQ: ZIOP ): "I think we missed this. I think I am late on it and I think it's gone too far. I'm sorry." Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS ): "I'm not going near Stratasys. Why? Because Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) is going to split in two, and one of them is going to have 3D printing. I don't want to be involved in another 3D bidder. I predictably don't like 3D or Voxeljet (NYSE: VJET )." Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR ): "I certainly do have an opinion and the opinion can be encapsulated into three words, sell, sell, sell."
