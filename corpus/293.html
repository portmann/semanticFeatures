Mitsubishi Motors Selling At 27% Below Its NAVPS - Mitsubishi Motors (OTCMKTS:MMTOF) | Seeking Alpha Often thought of as Toyota's little brother, Mitsubishi Motors (OTCPK: MMTOF ) can be overlooked by investors in the West who will naturally lean towards the better known Japanese brands of Honda (NYSE: HMC ), Toyota (NYSE: TM ) or Mazda (OTCPK: MZDAY ). Indeed, only 10% of Mitsubishi Motors' global sales are conducted in the US, and 20% in Europe. We like overlooked, as it can often mean opportunity for the individual investor. Mitsubishi Motors was brought to our attention as it ranks quite highly with a score of 71%. A brief look at the numbers shows that it is trading at a 27% discount to its NAVPS, which can mean two things - either Mitsubishi Motors is not performing well, or it is undervalued by the market. Mitsubishi Motors has not been without its problems. They have been plagued with quality issues in the past - since 1985 out of the top 15 vehicle producers sold in the US Mitsubishi Motors came 14th, with 5.3m units recalled and 4.8m units sold (a recall rate of 1.09). Putting that in perspective, Honda's recall rate was 0.94, Toyota's 0.80 and Mazda's (ranked second behind Mercedes) was an impressive 0.55. Also, over the past decade, Mitsubishi Motors has struggled with failed tie-ups with Daimler AG and Chrysler, quality and safety problems, and the costs of being a niche player in the global market for cars and light trucks. Plagued by a combination of factors, such as recall issues and a poor sales strategy in the United States, in 2004 Mitsubishi Motors was in a state of management crisis (they lost 474B JPY that fiscal year). It managed to steadily rebuild itself through the support of three Mitsubishi Group companies, and returned to profitability in 2007. Mitsubishi Motors went through another tough period when they were hit by the global economic and financial crisis of 2008. In 2011, this was followed by such natural disasters as the Great East Japan Earthquake, and flooding in Thailand which affected supply chains. In 2012, performance was further adversely affected by anti-Japanese sentiment in China and high JPY exchange rates. Management persevered throughout these setbacks, launching multiple mid-term business plans to counteract the market conditions, the latest of which was implemented in 2013 (it makes for interesting reading here ). In line with the Japanese idea of kaizen (small gradual improvements), these have never been ground shaking changes, but have sought to 'bolster strength and secure steady profits'. Although this sounds like management-speak, the figures will show that management have proved successful at steering Mitsubishi towards record levels of profitability. Since October, Mitsubishi Motors' share price has fallen from a high of 1331 JPY to today's price of 1,040 JPY, representing a 22% fall, and is now trading at a 1 year all time low. Before we begin to investigate why Mitsubishi Motors is at a 12 month low, let us discuss its previous 5 year performance All lines are trending in the correct direction. Most of their cash is derived from operations and the bulk of it is spent on capex, which is usual for a capital hungry industry such as vehicle production. They have also been paying off long term debt, and more interestingly for investors, the share price and equity per share are converging - when book value per share and share price meet this can often be interpreted as a buy signal. In 2013 management announced a shake up to operations , with the aim of reorganizing its capital, shoring up its balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. They issued a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, decreased capital by 75 percent to 165.7 billion yen ($1.6 billion) and canceled all 433.2 billion yen of capital reserves. So far, the restructuring has been successful and in 2014 they resumed dividend payments. Net income and EPS growth has been extraordinarily high, at around 100% compounded annual growth. This is much higher than the Japanese automobile industry standards. For example, Toyota, who sells the most vehicles of any manufacturer worldwide, has been growing its net profit at a rate of 69% per year. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement Free cash flow has remained positive over the past 5 years, and is growing at a healthy compounded rate of 43% a year. Mitsubishi Motors have substantially reduced their long term debt, paying off 62% (100B JPY / $843M) from 2012-2014; in 2014 the value of cash and deposits was double that of interest bearing debt. (source: Mitsubishi Motors' annual report ) Shareholder equity has more than doubled over the past 5 years. Cash from financing has decreased from -8B to -80B JPY from 2013-2014 due to Mitsubishi Motors paying off a large chunk of long term debt (100B JPY) and the purchase of treasury shares (180b JPY worth). The ratios suggest that Mitsubishi Motors is becoming more and more sensible in its valuations. The P/E ratio has come down from an uninvestable 250 to a much more attractive 9 as of today. We are seeing a similar situation with the Graham multiplier (any figure below 22.5 for this number was deemed attractive by Mr. Graham). The NAVPS has shot up thanks to the reverse stock split in 2013 and as the title of this article suggests, it is now 27% above the current share price. Mitsubishi is also becoming increasingly profitable and their profit margins are slowly creeping up towards Toyota, the undisputed king of lean production, levels (Toyota's operating profit margin in 2014 was 8.92%). Debt to equity levels are very low and the dividend payout ratio is at a sustainable 24% - although it is rare to find a Japanese company that pays more than 2.5% dividend so we would not expect any radical increase in yield forthcoming. Mitsubishi Motors release their full year results on April 27th. They forecast that they will have sold 1,089,000 units worldwide, 2.17T JPY in sales and have a bottom line of 110B JPY. So far they are on track to meet and possibly exceed these targets, as sales and net profit are up 4% and 5% respectively from the same period in 2014, and operating income is up 9%. Based on these growth figures, we can apply them to the final quarter of the previous year to ascertain with a reasonable level of accuracy the full year's expected figures. Normally manufacturers look to their domestic markets as the primary source of revenue before branching out into additional global territories, which tend to be more culturally challenging and have the additional risk of foreign exchange problems. In the case of Mitsubishi Motors, they face multiple problems with strong competition in the domestic market from Honda and Toyota, as well as the under-performing Japanese economy . These problems were further compounded with Abe raising the sales tax from 5% to 8% in 2014 (this is planned to raise again to 10% in October 2015). Inevitably this has been effecting sales in Japan, where unit sales were down 19% in the first 3 quarters of the 2014-2015 financial year, compared with the same period in the previous year. However sales in Japan only make up 9.8% of overall global unit sales (79,000 out of 806,000). Although there is strong sales growth in the US and Europe (22% and 15% respectively), this is not necessarily Mitsubishi Motors' USP. Their strength lies in the Asian market (we include north Asia, ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand - but not Japan) which make up 41.5% of sales. Throughout ASEAN Mitsubishi has a reputation of being the more affordable option for consumers who are looking for Japanese quality but find Toyota beyond their price point. In the Philippines the Montero model sells for $25,400 brand new, whereas the comparable Toyota Fortuner retails for $33,800. In countries where consumers are price sensitive due to lower salaries, this represents a huge saving. ASEAN is also the fastest growing region in the world, forecast to grow 6.4% in 2015 . Mitsubishi Motors are investing heavily in the ASEAN area. In 2014 they bought a defunct Ford production factory in the Philippines that will be ready for production in 2015. This is their second factory (current factory capacity is 30,000 units a year) in the Philippines and will immediately add a production capacity of 50,000 units a year, with plans to expand that to 100,000 units a year. The expansion aims to underpin MM's strength in Southeast Asia, which is a key pillar of its mid-term business plan. Mitsubishi is the No. 2 brand in the Philippines, behind Toyota, with a local market share of 21 percent. The company says that the Philippines, with the second largest population in Southeast Asia after Indonesia, has great potential because motorization is just about to take off. They are also leading a $600m investment to build a new factory in Indonesia and develop a new car, as they look to capitalise on Indonesia's large population and growing economy. With the help of the new plant, Mitsubishi Motors aims to boost its Indonesian market share to 13% from the current 8% and make Indonesia its second-biggest production base in Southeast Asia after Thailand. This plant will focus on developing a new MPV for the Asian market, and aims to product 80,000 MPVs a year, exporting 20,000 of these to the surrounding Asian countries. (source: Mitsubishi interim report ) Although the JPY has seen some upside in the past few weeks, it is still down 10% against major currencies from this time last year. Since 90% of sales are outside of Japan, this should result in more cash when profit from abroad is converted back to JPY - they made an additional 19.5B JPY on forex in first 3 quarters of 2014-2015. Reduction of raw material cost will also increase margins; and 19.1B JPY was saved in production costs in the first quarters of 2014-2015 ( see interim report, pg 5 ). Although sales are picking up in Europe and the US, MM is still a relatively unknown brand in the West, and this is what we like about it. Management have proven time and again that they can steer the company back in the right direction in the face of economic and market adversity. As company sales mature, so will revenue and net profit growth. We do not expect the high, recent levels of growth to be maintained, but instead we think that the reorganization and recent investments will maintain a more steady level of earnings growth. This does not make Mitsubishi Motors a bad investment, far from it. Current valuation levels mean that Mitsubishi is very cheap (it is rare to see a well run company cheaper than its NAVPS). If they can protect their niche against rival brands, Mitsubishi Motors should be a strong long term buy for your portfolio.
