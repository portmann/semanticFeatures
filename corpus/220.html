The Incremental Contribution Of BinOptics To M/A-COM - M/A-COM Technology Solutions Holdings (NASDAQ:MTSI) | Seeking Alpha The acquisition of BinOptics by MTSI in December has already generated benefits for MTSI as well as paved the way for great earnings in the foreseeable future. The quadrupling of indium phosphide laser capacity addresses industry supply constraints and should result in meaningful sales for MTSI. M/A-COM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MTSI ) (MACOM) is a leading supplier of high performance analog RF, microwave, millimeter wave and photonic semiconductor products that enable next-generation Internet and modern battlefield applications. It is recognized for its broad catalog portfolio of products and technologies (GaN, GaAs, InP, SiGe, HMIC and Silicon) and serves diverse markets, including high speed optical, satellite, radar, wired and wireless networks, automotive (Ford is 19% of revenue), industrial, medical and mobile devices. In its fiscal year ended October 3, 2014, MACOM posted $418 million in revenue and earned $1.25 per share (non-GAAP). MACOM's growth is being driven by the cloud-connected apps economy and the modern networked battlefield, and is developing a richer product mix, as indicated in the following graphic: Source: MACOM Corporate Presentation February 2015 In 2014, MACOM's stock price virtually doubled from $16.07 to $31.53 as investors noticed the company's transformation. And in late 2014, the company took a significant step toward more growth and an even richer product mix when it announced the $230 million acquisition of privately owned BinOptics Corporation, a leading merchant provider of indium phosphide (INP) lasers for data centers, wireless backhaul, silicon photonics, fiber to the home (FTTH) and telecom/datacom. In the announcement, there was no mention of BinOptics' revenues, margins or profitability, but there was comment by John Croteau, MACOM's CEO, about MACOM's post-closing business plans to expand BinOptics' capacity in order to solve supply-chain problems in the industry: "The whole industry has been capacity constrained to the point where there has really been supply limitations in the access part of the market, but they also service big data sectors. So high growth potential at the end market level, again with suppliers that have been fading away, so they've got somewhat of an open playing field to give you the sense of what we plan to do with them, our internal goals which we're working to underpin or we can think about integer multiples increases in capacity, so doubling in six months, quadrupling in a year. It was kind of exponential growth potential. And our sense for the customer diligence process is that could all just - the revenues could scale accordingly." "Solving the supply chain issues for this critical component is a big, big, big deal and doing it with a high performance, high quality product is what it's all about." "The first stage of capacity expansion has to do with adding a few tools, improving the operational efficiencies, using what I would suspect would be a little more mature operational management approaches to maximizing yields, maximizing throughput and so on. And the belief is generally that we could as much double the laser capacity within six months just through those very few million dollars of CapEx. The second thing that was very interesting that we found was our tool set here in (Lowell) for our production facility is 100% compatible with producing the lasers. There is again just a couple of additional tools, couple of million dollars needed and we can replicate everything and that will be Ithaca doubling yet again capacity and producing yielding a dual source copy exacts for these lasers, which is a big, big deal to the telecommunications industry." Fast-forward three months, another earnings call, and some SEC filings, and the picture gets clearer. From MACOM"s Form 8 K/A filing on 2/5/15 (Amendment 2), we see the following critical P&L components for BinOptics' fiscal year ended September 30, 2014: Operating Income $16.9 million (37.3% margin) In the most recent earnings conference call, Mr. Croteau reiterated MACOM's intention to quadruple capacity, and with the basic BinOptics' P&L provided by the Form 8-K filing, we now have a sense of the magnitude of the plan. But just because there's more capacity doesn't mean that there are sales. Or does it? In response to how quickly revenue is generated off the increased capacity, Mr. Croteau said: "It's instant. So as soon as you build, we can ship every product that we produce at least through this fiscal year. So the - when we say doubling in six months, that is through yield improvements and debottlenecking the factory in (indiscernible) New York and some minor capital investment. So that will - starting in six months be that step function. It's difficult within the first three months and then the second thing that was operating in parallel is we're replicating the production line Lowell in our factory in Massachusetts and that opens up a much broader capability for capacity. When we say doubling yet again, reality is we could probably increase it ten-fold and not run into any equipment issues." So "if you build it, they will come" turns into, "if you quadruple capacity, you can sell everything you make." Pretty cool! So if i) MACOM can quadruple capacity in a capacity-constrained industry, ii) the sales mix is the same, and iii) sales are "instant," then sales should close to quadruple as well. The following model of possible earnings shows the extended math of quadrupled sales, constant margins, reasonable post-expansion expenses and incremental earnings per share (both GAAP and non-GAAP) through FY16: NOTE: The previous model is not BinOptics' P&L, but of MACOM's indium phosphide business that's being made possible by the BinOptics' acquisition. The $78.1 million incremental operating income (or $89.3 million incremental operating income non-GAAP) would not have been feasible without the acquisition of BinOptics, the subsequent capacity expansion, and the industry supply constraints that create the demand. So how big a deal is this to MACOM? This acquisition positions MACOM to take advantage of the decade-long 100G build out as a broad line supplier for 100G transceiver components in a market that's expected to triple between 2014 and 2018. Financially, and in better perspective, the following chart shows MACOM's historical non-GAAP operating income with the pro-forma operating income shown of the indium phosphide business through FY 16. Note: Non-GAAP Operating Income excludes Goodwill Amortization While the preceding chart is not exactly to scale, it is very close, and the incremental Operating Income in FY16 due to the BinOptics acquisition and the indium phosphide business puts MACOM on pace to almost double non-GAAP operating income from FY14 to FY16. The following chart showing Actual and ProForma non-GAAP EPS basis is a little more impressive: Non-GAAP EPS has risen from $.94/share in FY12 to $1.25/share in FY14. Part of the quadrupled capacity and sales will be visible in the current fiscal year (ending September 2015) but the most evidence of this expansion will be seen in FY16 when capacity expansion is complete and sales are robust. While capacity constraints will not continue indefinitely in the industry, MACOM believes the industry will be capacity constrained through FY15, and the BinOptics acquisition has secured strategic supplier status for MACOM, per Mr. Croteau: "After the announcements of our definitive agreement to acquire BinOptics, it became clear literally overnight that the strategic upside of the transaction would exceed our expectations. Having the right products at the right time to address a serious bottleneck and pain point in our customer' supply chains in 2015, BinOptics has emerged as a potential catalyst for our networks business overall, vaulting MACOM to strategic vendor status in some of the largest telecommunications OEMs worldwide. Since closing the deal on December 15, we've been in discussions with strategic customers regarding expanded relationships and cross selling opportunities across all networks product lines." All things considered, we now understand why Mr. Croteau said, in response to a question about the post-closing integration of BinOptics: "…I mean, BinOptics is shaping up to be a goldmine" We concur. MACOM's revenue opportunities should continue for the foreseeable future, the incremental cash contribution from the indium phosphide business should be impressive, and MTSI shareholders should see considerable share price appreciation.
