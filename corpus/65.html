Bank Of America Is A Concern - Cramer's Lightning Round (3/2/15) | Seeking Alpha Mar.  3, 2015  6:54 AM ET  |  Includes: AMX , BAC , HD , HPQ , LOW , MACK , MFRM , MSFT , MU , QTWO , VZ , WFC by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Merrimack Pharma (NASDAQ: MACK ): "We like them. That was one of our big pharma picks. We still continue to like it and I think it's in real good shape." Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ): "I am concerned, but I notice this is the fourth largest position for Warren Buffett. He makes note of it and he says he likes it. That said, I like his other big bank. I am a Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) fan. That's what my charitable trust owns and I wish it were even bigger." Mattress Firm Holdings (NASDAQ: MFRM ): "With a 52-week high today, that's more of a bedding company than I like. And don't forget that when you want to do bedding, you go with Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) or Lowe's (NYSE: LOW )." Q2 Holdings (NYSE: QTWO ): "That came public at a particularly good time that a lot of others came public. I got to do more work on it because it's cloud based, and I'm not sure." America Movil (NYSE: AMX ): "Too hard, no. If you want telecom, just go with Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and get that yield." Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ): "I think Micron's having a decent quarter, but a lot of people think it's too tied to PCs. Anything PC after Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), I am worried about. I am technically worried about Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) more than I am about Micron. So I am in the don't buy category. You can hold it, but I'm a little nervous about it."
