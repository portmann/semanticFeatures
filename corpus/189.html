Micron: The Case Of The Missing PE - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha The oligopoly industry structure should support much higher company PE valuations than it currently does - especially for Micron. The industry moat - the barriers to entry by other entities - is secure and durable. Based on its current PE, Micron is remarkably cheap, assuming executive management performs competently. "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" I'm one of these "expect the best and plan for the worst" kind of people, and sometimes that leads folks to believe I'm a little paranoid. Well, maybe I am - not so much from a "they're out to get me" kind of mentality, but more of a "there's always one more thing to do" perspective. One of those turn the key and then pull on the door handle kind of people. From long and hard experience, I've found that the biggest mistakes I make happen when I don't test my theories against reality - check and recheck. And that leads us directly to today's topic - Micron's (NASDAQ: MU ) PE - which, quite frankly, is bugging the hell out of me. I just do not understand why it is so low. Its value - currently 9.90 looking backward and, against my $3.65 EPS projection for FY '15, about 8.2 looking forward - is absurdly low and does not comport at all against my theory of the case. I have dismissed this element for some time thinking that the inevitable messiness of the Elpida acquisition simply made analyzing Micron too complex, and as a result, the market simply hunkered down to a safe position while the smoke cleared. We are well past that point now. Now, it's time to get on the line and phone Houston - we have a problem. The warning klaxon is sounding, the red lights are flashing - what is going on here? Let's scrub down this PE thing and see if the problem is real or if it's a warning system malfunction that can be fixed. Have I fallen so foolishly in love with the "this time it's different" theory that I am blinded to the "truth"? This analysis will address that topic head on. Does Micron deserve this low PE? Is there some "improbable" out there that has been dismissed as immaterial that in fact is hugely material? Let's dig in. First, the price-to-earnings ratio - what is it? Fundamentally, it's the price an investor is willing to pay for a $1 of earnings. As such, the PE is among the most important indicators of demand for a stock. Since there is a finite amount of equity shares, the stock markets (in this case the Nasdaq) mediate demand and supply, and high demand stocks get their prices bid up and relatively low demand stocks languish. According to the Nasdaq website, the average PE of all of the stocks that list on their exchange is 22.95 as of Feb 27, 2015. Micron, in other words, is selling its earnings for less than half the price of its peers on the exchange. Less than half! SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) is almost twice as expensive as Micron. Now, I love SanDisk (I am long SNDK) - I think it is worth more than that - but it doesn't compute for me that Micron should be valued so much lower. What gives??? Let's pair this with Zacks' consensus estimate of EPS growth in roughly the same time period. Let me just say up front that I think the consensus EPS view is way wrong. I see EPS only up marginally this year, up 30-40% next year, and trending above 20% in 2017 and 2018. Even so, by Zacks' own view why wouldn't the PE be up significantly if anyone actually believed their 2015 and 2016 forecast? Let's dig deeper. If we peel the onion one more layer, the other thing that we can say about the PE is that it is a reflection of the confidence of the investor in the durability of the earnings stream that they're buying. After all, even with no revenue growth assumed, I am more willing to pay a premium if I can be sure I'm going to get the assumed level of earnings in year 5 or year 10 that I get in year 1. Maybe investors don't have confidence in the intermediate and long-term earning potential of the company? At higher PEs, the metric reflects an investor's confidence relating to both revenue and earnings momentum. Ideally, if we're going to pay a lot for a stock and drive it to a high PE, we want a company that is operating in a high TAM environment that promises to deliver good and increasingly better revenue and earnings per share growth year on year, right? Boil it all down - PE can be a direct reflection of the emotions of the buyer. Consider the "cult" stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) that are carrying PEs that seem inexplicably high. Micron definitely doesn't have to worry about any irrational exuberance infecting its PE. Maybe that's because it is such an institutional plaything, being 97% owned by the guys who hire the Harvard MBAs to build the 50-tab spreadsheets to do the analysis on their positions. There are so few "retail" investors with positions in Micron that even if we all went crazy on it we don't move enough volume to affect it. Obviously, nobody is getting carried away here. What is it that the institutions are seeing that we are not seeing? Is it possible that the theory is misguided? Is there a special Micron exemption in it that says "the theory" doesn't apply to Micron? Maybe the theory is right, but the institutions have no confidence in Micron's management to run the business well? Have I missed anything? It's time to go back to square one and check every facet of the case for Micron. In my mind, it is impossible to believe the company doesn't deserve a PE of 20. If I'm right, Micron is even more a screaming buy than when Russ called the turn almost a year and a half ago. If I'm wrong, well, let's say our mea culpas and move on. The "oligopoly" theory and the corporate strategy that results from it - by now you know what I'm talking about - if you don't, look here and here - so let's move to the scorecard. As a first step in assessing the strategy, let's create a scorecard taking the strategic elements in order and assigning a letter grade: Capacity constraint - "A-". Is there any doubt in anyone's mind that the four entities of MIPO - Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), SK Hynix, Sanshiba, (SanDisk/Toshiba ( OTCPK:TOSBF )) and IMFT (Micron/Intel (NASDAQ: INTC )) - have bought into this strategic initiative with almost missionary fever? Against the backdrop of tech-node-advance wafer loss that is taking out 10-20% of DRAM wafers and 40-50% of NAND wafers per node, overall industry wafer additions have been relatively paltry. Samsung has its Xian NAND Fab going in and has announced a new (mostly logic and a little DRAM) Fab Line 17 in South Korea; SK Hynix has a new DRAM Fab under construction, Micron just announced its new Singapore 3-D NAND Fab 10 expansion, and Sanshiba is building out NAND Fab 5, but the overall effect of that building will be to barely replace the capacity lost. DRAM wafer output is expected to be flat or down this year. NAND wafer output will rise barely 5%. The only reason I give the strategy an "A-" is that with Samsung's smartphone business in rapid decline, it had some DRAM and (mostly) NAND output that was thrown onto the merchant market last year. While the net effect of this was that DRAM prices went up as demand surged and NAND was only marginally weaker in Q4, this still is a warning sign that Samsung's business model could in the future pose momentary strains on the memory industry's capacity management planning. Spot pricing - "B+" What "spot" pricing? Less and less of the industry's output is being made available out of contract, and this heretofore vital industry statistic will continue to fade. To the extent that it has any utility at all, it will be either as a measure of Samsung's consumer product business health, or as a resource for sellers and buyers of fab "seconds" and not yet qualified otherwise good product that needs a home out of contract. Made for inventory vs. made for order - "I" for incomplete. In this area, the signs are promising but it's too early to say for sure. More and more product - particularly mobile and server DRAM - is in short supply and is being allocated to contract customers. Past Micron conference calls have seen commentary that order periods are lengthening. Note in this regard the Samsung-Apple agreement for DRAM. Having been burned with the iPhone 6 DRAM debacle, Apple is clearly moving to ensure that it will have enough supply going into the next product generation. In the NAND technology, rumors abound that SanDisk lost Apple because it was not able (or willing) to ship enough product to meet Apple's needs. Poor planning breeds nasty surprises. We're still early in the transition, but over time both the suppliers and the customers will become accustomed to a forecast - make to forecast - managed from backlog business model. This is the inevitable result of manufacturing diverse and differentiated products in a capacity constrained market. Gross margins - "B-". Overall, the trend has been for margins to rise across the industry in DRAM, with the only real caution in my mind being the relatively short time frame we've had to analyze this trend. In NAND, the picture is decidedly more mixed, but SanDisk's move in its Long-Term Model to project higher NAND business gross margins ongoing is a reflection of its confidence in this strategic element, despite its mixed results over the last six quarters. Micron's DRAM margins have climbed consistently and its confidence in this projection was strongly reflected in the new Inotera deal just inked. Short term, we have certainly seen some downward movement. Though Micron's NAND margins climbed through most of 2014, the last quarter of the year and the first quarter of this year were projected to be weaker because of the NAND thrown on the market by Samsung's mobile division fail last year. Micron's NAND projections are decidedly more bullish from 2H 2015 onward as it corrects some glaring product issues. Revenues - "I" for Incomplete. We simply haven't had enough time to assess how this metric will behave because we are only one year into Micron's acquisition of Elpida. The initial data is certainly promising with DRAM, but its NAND business has been spotty because of its TLC problems. SanDisk's LTM, with its reference guide of 10% YOY for revenue growth, is a strong reflection of confidence on its part. Samsung is hard to assess as its conglomerate structure really doesn't give us good visibility into the revenue growth of its memory business. Gartner did take a stab at it: "As a group, DRAM vendors outperformed the rest of the semiconductor industry. This follows the trend seen in 2013 due to a booming DRAM market that saw revenue increase 31.7 percent during 2014 as the undersupply and stable pricing continued," said Andrew Norwood, research vice president at Gartner. "In contrast to 2013, which saw revenue decline in key device categories, including ASIC, discretes and microcomponents, all device categories saw positive growth in 2014, but none could match the growth of the memory market, which grew 16.9 percent in 2014." - Gartner Group - Market Share Analysis: Preliminary Total Semiconductor Revenue, Worldwide, 2014 [ED. Emphasis added] Ok. What do you think? If we consider the grades in aggregate it looks promising to me. Am I blinded by love here when I say I think the strategic case is holding? It's still a little early yet, I'll give you that, but reality seems to be proving out the theory. Bottom line, I see no reason to bash Micron's PE because of strategic factors relating to MIPO and I sure as heck don't see a special Micron exclusion anywhere in this. If anything, Micron's PE should be reacting favorably. It hasn't. The strategy is sound - it just isn't working for Micron. Let's look harder for a possible cause for the PE deficit. As I challenge myself to find a hole in this strategic case, there is only one area where I can find it potentially challengeable. It is: The strategic moat. The whole oligopoly argument stands or falls on MIPO remaining a small organization. The barriers to entry into this exclusive club must be ironclad and absolute. We must remember that this industry condition is a very recent event. Here's a slide from Dr. Jung-Bae Lee's presentation at Samsung's May Investor's Forum Event that says it all: Note the number of suppliers across the top. Micron, S.K. Hynix, and Samsung stand alone in DRAM. Along with Intel and the Japanese, they were the early players in the bloody DRAM game, and they have done everything up to and including price fixing (Micron wasn't punished for that because it ratted everybody out !) to stay alive in this business. Hynix, originally part of the Hyundai Electronics Group, went bankrupt in 2001 and reorganized with the help of the Korean government, and Samsung survived only because of support through the Chaebol. They have all the IP that is worth having (including Intel which shares it with Micron as a part of the IMFT agreement) and their R&D investments in future memory dwarf all the other companies by decimal orders of magnitude. Arguably, the moat gets wider by the day. I have discussed this topic in much greater detail here , but for now I want to focus on two points that need to be addressed that haven't been discussed before. The context of the first point requires us to step back and consider the industry we are discussing here. Many of you have heard Intel called "the most important company in the world". Through its fierce and unrelenting stewardship of Moore's Law, it has arguably been the engine of the ever expanding technological world that exists today. And that is all well and very good. As you know, we need to move only one short step away on that value chain from the processor to find memory. If Intel and now ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) and some others are the engine of our new digital economy, then MIPO makes the fuel those engines run on. Let's be very clear - without memory those new style processors and devices of amazing diversity and abundance don't go anywhere. Imagine some diabolical plot by a terrorist group that blows up the world's memory fabs. Want to take a shot at how world GDP estimates would change in reaction to that event? By any measure, semiconductor memory is one of the seminal products of the modern world. Please forgive if I seem to be belaboring the obvious, but sometimes it's the obvious thing that is the most difficult to see, and that is this: Micron operates in a "strategic" industry. It is now a strategically vital company from a US economic perspective. This formerly mongrel dog that was beaten, abused, chewed on and pummeled by the forces of technology and irresponsible state capital investments in the old DRAM industry over the course of close to 30 years - this same beast that has suffered so many near death experiences that it is eligible for the crash test dummy hall of fame; this same half-eared, one-eyed, scraggly-haired hound - still limping from the effects of its many battles over time - has anybody mentioned the converts or technology lag lately? - this very same animal is now a crown jewel in the American economy. Best (and only in US based DRAM) in the show! OK. What does this have to do with the moat? Just this - strategic industries and companies play by different rules. First off, nothing is going to happen very fast in regard to changes in the industry in either size or composition. As long as MIPO delivers great product in adequate quantities, none of the stakeholders in the industry will want to see any change. Micron is not going anywhere. We can invest in the company and be quite comfortable that if we want to buy the stock and "stick it in a drawer", it will still be there 10, 20 years hence when we open that drawer again. How can I be so confident of that? For one thing, it is now highly unlikely that it will be acquired. A non-US company will never be allowed to even try it. Even among US companies, the number of possible acquirers is small and getting smaller because of the horribly complex anti-trust issues that would be in play. As one of the few pure merchant memory providers (2 in DRAM and 3 in NAND), it is highly unlikely that say, Apple or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) could make a play for it without signing on to very restrictive "fair market" conventions. Having given this a lot of thought, the only ones I see that have a real shot at it are Intel - and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ). Even an Intel bid would face severe market concentration issues. Bottom line - Micron is with us for the long haul. Secondly, Micron's safe position behind the moat gives it defensive power that is truly formidable for any entity (state or private) that is thinking of entering the memory business in anything other than a boutique fashion. And it simply gets worse (from the prospective entrant's view) over time. Micron's increasing scale over the years will give it market power that is simply unassailable. LBJ used to warm up those New-Deal-loving Texas political crowds in the 30s with a little story about the power of the federal government to weigh in on behalf of the "little guy". They (the big guys) are going to find out, he would say, what it's like to be a hitchhiker caught out on the side of the road in a West Texas hailstorm - he can't run, he can't hide, and it won't go away. MIPO is that hailstorm, but with baseball-sized hail. No one is crossing that moat. We are less than two short years into this new era of oligopolistic power and companies on both sides of the transaction are still growing into full understanding of the new environment. Power relationships, and that IS what we are talking about, rarely change rapidly, but they do change. This Monopoly board that the new memory game is being played on doesn't have just two places for Boardwalk and Park Place, it has a whole Rodeo drive that occupies the entire right quadrant of the board. You will not pass go and you sure as heck will pay a lot more than $200 to traverse the fine piece of real estate that MIPO now owns. Get used to it. Micron will see a 60% DRAM gross margin next year and there's no reason NAND won't match that down the road. Thirdly, the whole idea of market share as a strategic goal of a memory firm (that bogey man that obsesses so many of the writers about this space) will fade into a well-deserved obscurity, never to be seen again. Why? Here's why. Oligopolies seek stability - share gains threaten stability and lack of stability is bad for business. The state powers that be will not allow the existence of their firms to be threatened. Share gains make everybody nervous, and beyond a few points of back and forth share trade over time, won't be tolerated. Want to test this idea? Go back a few years and review the "anti-dumping" campaign that Micron instigated to survive yet another year. The industry powers won't allow it. Memory is absolutely vital but small portion of their BOM. As much as the customers for memory would like lower costs in this area, cost of memory is not the main thing. They want assurance of supply and quality. They need stability in this vital area. Neither Apple, nor HP, or Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ), for that matter, will tolerate the existence of MIPO firms to be threatened. We have already witnessed how Intel and Apple together enabled Micron to acquire Elpida. As long as MIPO does an adequate job of maintaining supply, nothing is going to change that situation. The above is not intended to argue that over time the market share of the participants won't make slight adjustments - it will. But it will happen in much more granular ways than we have heretofore contemplated. The key point is that share change won't be a strategic goal of the firm because that goal will always be subordinate to capacity restraint. Competition will remain fierce, but it will be tactical in scope. There will be more and more product categories over time as the customers demand differentiated product. PC demand falling? - move more bits into mobile or server. Mobile LPDDR business getting tougher? - move production into the EMCP mobile offering with last generation LPDDR. And so on. Companies are not competing on price nearly as much as overall value to the customer. Packaging now plays a very large (and growing larger over time) role. In these specific market segments, share will change depending on the strength of the supplier's offerings. Each of the competitors has made it quite clear that they value revenue share over bit share - they want to sell the highest margin bits into the specific user application requirement. Each of them, however, are going at that goal in a different way. Here's Samsung's strategy, in another slide from Dr. Jung-Bae Lee's presentation at Samsung's May 2014 Investor's Forum Event. (Caution - those of you who have lived through the recent hysteria over the Apple/Samsung deal may detect an eerie connection to this recent news.) There it is - the Samsung/Apple deal in a nutshell. Whether Samsung got a premium price we don't know, but why wouldn't it? Whether or not Micron's margins are any less with LPDDR3 in an EMCP package to Xiaomi is also unknown. The point is though, that Samsung's goal is not bit share but revenue and profit share through superior innovation. Micron, in its turn, wants to be customer focused, achieving higher margins through leveraging the breadth of its product portfolio to meet specific customer requirements. Because of that Micron has found that EMCP has been a huge winner for it with the Chinese OEMs because of their cost and time-to-market focus. Out of that have come higher margins for its NAND and DRAM products as they are now being sold into these mobile environments where they weren't before - and the really important thing to remember is that this result has nothing, per se, to do with either DRAM or NAND - the sum was truly greater than the parts. Market share, measured in gross terms like DRAM or NAND share may change slightly, but none of the current MIPO members has any interest in a radical reshaping of the shares of the individual companies. There is one final nightmare possibility to assess that relates to market share: the "technology breakout" scenario. (Upfront apologies for this, but we did say we would consider EVERYTHING.) It goes something like this: Company "A" (oh hell with that - it's always Company "S" with the sky is falling crowd) - company "S" brings to market a "game-changing, disruptive", etc. etc. (plug in your favorite technology name here) that forever changes the face of computing as we know it, blah blah - you get the idea. The fact is, though, that historically nothing happens very fast in the memory business which is just now after 30+ years going to a new NAND technology and still hasn't turned over a new leaf in DRAM 40 years on. And the technology piece of this is just the beginning. Never forget - memory is a scale game. It's one thing to make one, but in an era when new fabs are going anywhere from $5B to $15B, it's an entirely different thing to make BILLIONS of this new game changing thing. The other thing to keep in mind - this next really, really big thing may have to wait on a redefinition on the semantics of computing. (See the HMC standards process for a good primer on this issue.) And then, failing that, there's that old standby - drum roll, please! - software - which has to be brought along and always will be just six months away from release. (Isn't it good to know that SOME things never change?) So, if the above is true, is there anything else out there that could threaten the moat? What power or conglomeration of powers could overcome MIPO's position - at least in the next decade? There are two that I have seen discussed on our Boards, so let's talk about them. First off: Personally, I don't see China Inc. as a factor for at least the balance of this decade. That being said, I am not so sure about 2020 and beyond. This is a very complex topic and I will devote a future article to it. Here's the bottom line though: A Chinese firm is not likely to cross the MIPO moat in any material way in the next 10 years. They simply do not have access to the IP and even then (say, with an acquisition of one of the boutique firms that has some next generation NVM IP) we're well into the next decade before the technology will be cost competitive. We should never say "never" with China, but there is no reason to think this factor should have an effect on MIPO companies' forward PEs. There is another entity that could have an effect, though, and that is: If you've been interested in the memory business in these SA pages, then you have certainly read Russ Fischer's thesis that Intel will likely reenter the memory business - most likely in NAND. Here's a recap of his arguments and my counter . In the interest of not making this already long article unacceptably long, here's my net position: Intel is already in the memory business through IMFT. In my view, it is quite possible that Intel will press to expand the IMFT charter and capability beyond the Lehi fab over the course of the next two years so that it has more supply of 3-D NAND to grow its SSD business. The "converged" architecture that is the future of computing, where memory and logic are close companions in a package, a la the HMC architecture, may be another factor that will lead Intel to expand its relationship in order to provision the next generation processor/memory package. Beyond that, I just don't see it going further, at least until the next big memory architecture swing is well underway and its impact is understood. This isn't going to happen until the early half of the next decade. Bottom line, a potential Intel move into the memory business is not in the cards. Back to the central point. There is no reason to believe that the MIPO moat will be challenged any time in the foreseeable future. No actor, inside or outside of MIPO, wants to challenge the stability of the status quo. The stakes are too high. Surveying the whole landscape, leaving no stone, however small, untouched. What have I missed? What are those fresh-faced Harvard MBA guys that slave away for the institutional investors seeing that I can't see? In what possible area could Micron disappoint investors over time? Maybe this one thing… Revenue. If you challenged me to identify one weak link, a point of paranoia, so to speak, it might be in revenue growth. After all, as good as the gross margins may become, if revenues don't grow, then Micron's story definitely isn't as attractive. And if the central strategy of the oligopoly is to restrain output - which it certainly is - then how can we be sure that there will be any revenue growth long term that is not directly attributable to margin expansion? This topic is particularly complex to analyze in an industry whose raison d'etre is to reduce unit prices as production volume increases. It may be very difficult ongoing to assume YOY 10-20% revenue increases. Now that didn't stop Judy Bruner, the super savvy CFO of SanDisk, from signing up for a 10% YOY revenue growth figure for the company's LTM model. And you gotta know that Sanjay Mehrotra (a shrewd operator if there ever was one) wouldn't have signed his name to that Model if he didn't think he could beat it. UPOD, right? Ultimately, it comes down to confidence in the NAND market for them. Of course, they ARE the best in this business, IMHO. Can we extend that confidence to those battle-scared survivors at Micron who depend on DRAM for 2/3s of their business? Maybe from an industry wide perspective the picture will become a little clearer. Fundamentally, we're looking for TAM (Total Addressable Market) expansion. If that's the case, and if we buy into the strategy tenet outlined above that market share expansion is not a goal of the individual companies in the oligopoly, then as night followeth day we should see all the individual companies grow with TAM growth. That should work, shouldn't it? Well, Houston, maybe we do have small problem here. DRAM TAM is in fact supposed to be declining beyond 2016. - Rambus - compiled from various industry forecasts (e.g. IHS, ABI Research) As it turns out, the chart above is misleading. As is so often the case in this complex business, new types of memory will be shipping in 2016 - on a time frame that adds considerable revenue to the overall "memory" TAM. In fact, there is zero evidence that the total memory market opportunity is going to do anything but generate strong TAM increases for the foreseeable future. It boils down to a bet on human creativity. Do you REALLY believe that there is any chance that human innovation won't always exceed our ability to provision it with computing power and memory? I don't, and with DRAM demand growing at 25% a year and NAND demand growing at 35-40% a year, I see ample opportunity for the MIPO crew to reduce prices at a rate that is less than cost reductions achieved through tech node advances as capacity grows at roughly a rate 5% less than demand increase. This will lead to very good revenue and profit increases through time. My estimate is for 20-25% YOY revenue gains on average through the end of this decade. It will be lumpy, though, and here's why. Capacity restraint will dictate very few new fabs being built and that means that all the suppliers will face retooling and conversion years like the one Micron is having this year in DRAM. Even with these bankable TAM increases, however, are we assured that all will be well for each of the MIPO companies? Well, no - not really. It's one thing to be shipping the same relative share of bits, but what if SanDisk is consistently better at getting a higher price for its NVM bits than, say, Micron? Micron could actually gain bit share in MIPO and lose revenue share if it fails to execute and it sees its ASPs decline more than bit quantities shipped increase. We are, after all, still talking about a very competitive industry - it's just that within the oligopoly structure the nature of the competition has changed. Price competition has reduced or eliminated, but VALUE and COST competition hasn't abated at all. In fact, it has gotten fiercer. Gross Margin growth will reflect both those factors, but for revenue growth we've got to consider how well the companies do in fashioning and executing value add strategies. That's pretty clear, right? Cost is no longer the driver of the competitive bus. Is it possible that a 3-member DRAM industry and a 4-member NVM industry will have stars and laggards? Nobody is going away, but maybe one or two of the firms just sort of limp along, albeit at a very comfortable level? Could it be that the real key to Micron's low PE is revealed in the company's conduct of its business? We're going to take a hard look at that in the next article in this series, so stay tuned. For now, though, let's conclude this piece on strategic threats to Micron's PE with a snapshot of the current PEs of another industry that through acquisition, bankruptcy and reorganization has become an oligopoly in the past two years - the airline business. This is the business that Warren Buffett said of a few years back - "If a capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk back in the early 1900s, he should have shot Orville Wright. He would have saved his progeny money." Of the list above, only Delta (NYSE: DAL ) came close to generating more free cash flow - $2.6B - in FY '14 than Micron at $3.04B. The next closest was Southwest (NYSE: LUV ) at $1.15B. Does oligopoly work to support a much higher PE for Micron? I rest my case. So why isn't the PE higher? The challenge must be on the operating side of the equation. I don't see anything in the strategic case that contradicts the "this time it's different" theory. More to come... and yeah, Col. Chaffee, I still want to know the "truth". Stay tuned... Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
