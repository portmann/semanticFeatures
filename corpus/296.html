How A Stabilizing Japanese Economy Is Benefiting The Yen | Seeking Alpha Japanese exports grew in January, reaching multi-year highs. Meanwhile, economic activity emerged from recession in the fourth quarter. As the Japanese economy improves in coming months, the yen could appreciate against European currencies moving towards negative interest rates. The Japanese yen has stabilized as exports and employment measures rose the last few months. CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSEARCA: FXY ) has traded sideways since December after tumbling over 14% in 2014, as is seen in the chart below. Japanese exports reached multi-year highs in recent months as a weaker currency spurred trade. In January, the exports figure grew by an annual pace of 17%, up from the previous month's reading of 12.9%, as well as exceeding estimates for 11.9%. After bottoming in 2009, exports have nearly doubled, shown below. The drastic increase in foreign trade buoyed economic activity as consumer spending and investment lag. "A pickup in shipments - which had been a soft spot in the economy - is welcome news for policymakers who hope exports will offset still-weak private consumption, and cheaper oil prices will spur firms to spend more on wages and investment, generating a virtuous growth cycle," according to Reuters. Additionally, as exports firmed in recent months, economic growth emerged from recession. In the fourth quarter, the economic growth figure came in at 2.2%, above the previous quarter's reading of -1.9%, as well as exceeding estimates for 3.7%. Since the financial crisis, economic growth in Japan has been very volatile, fluctuating between growth and contraction every few years, as is seen in the chart below. Analysts believe that although the growth figure remains low, it is headed in the right direction , which is a positive for its currency. "The recovery is still weak, particularly the domestic components. There was almost no growth in capital expenditure and private consumption also remains weak. However, the numbers are within are expectation - we still expect the economy to grow by 1-2% this year," IHS Global Insight principal economist Harumi Taguchi told CNBC. Lastly, an additional positive sign for the Japanese economy is the level of jobs to population growth. In December, the employment to population figure grew by an annual pace of 0.82%, slightly below the previous month's reading of 0.89%. The employment figure, however, has recovered to the pace of growth experienced prior to the financial crisis, as is seen below. This signals a firming in the labor market that may soon lead to increased consumer spending. With employment, exports, and economic growth all recovering in Japan, its currency has stabilized in recent months. While the long-term trend against the U.S. dollar may be lower as monetary policies diverge, the yen could appreciate against currencies like the euro and its European counterparts moving towards negative rates in coming months.
