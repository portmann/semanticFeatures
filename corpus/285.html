Sony's Change In Strategy: Insider Tom Rothman To Create Movie Magic - Sony Corporation (NYSE:SNE) | Seeking Alpha Out with Amy Pascal and in with Tom Rothman. It has been an ugly few months for Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE ). Last year's cyber-attacks crippled the company and brought forth a lot of shadows over the organization. Despite this, SNE has seen a nice climb in its stock price in the past few months. On Tuesday, the company signaled a time for change as it named a successor to Amy Pascal, former chairman of Sony's motion picture group. Her replacement will be Tom Rothman. Mr. Rothman was previously a leader at Sony's TriStar Pictures. Prior to working for Sony, Rothman spent 12 years working at Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ), as the co-head of its movie studio. Rothman will be reporting to Michael Lynton, Sony Entertainment Chief Executive, who just recently finished renewing his contract. Rothman graduated from Columbia Law School in 1980 as a James Kent Scholar, the school's highest academic. In 1981, he served on The United States Court of Appeals Second Circuit as a law clerk for the Honorable Walter Mansfield. Transferring to an attorney role in 1982, Rothman worked as an attorney at Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz. He co-produced his first film Down By Dawn and shortly after, Candy Mountain in 1986. Fox Films earned over $30 billion in box office, more than 150 Oscar nominations, three Best Picture Awards, and includes the two highest grossing films ever while Rothman worked there. Rothman resigned as chairman and chief executive of Fox Filmed Entertainment in 2012. Also in 2012, he was appointed an independent director of Priceline Group (NASDAQ: PCLN ). Rothman was brought into Sony by his predecessor, Ms. Pascal, a close friend. Amy Pascal's tenure at Sony was a battle of philosophies. Ms. Pascal herself was a heavy spender. Reports from the Financial Times accused her of having an assistant who made over $250,000 and used other company perks that many would consider outrageous and financially irresponsible. It was actively known that investor, Daniel Loeb, accused the senior management at Sony Pictures of financial mismanagement. In actuality, during the last few years of Pascal's rein, Sony Pictures was able to bring down spending and bring salaries of actors and directors in line with its peers, according to Ben Fritz from the Wall Street Journal. Rothman will be aliening his talents with Sony Pictures' existing goals. The industry is changing and many firms realize this. Sony has inspirations of starting and rebuilding existing franchises with an emphasis on films that will attract a large international audience. Sony chose Rothman for his success at revitalizing franchises at Fox. There were numerous other experienced potential hires, but Michael Lynton wanted the guy that could create some magic. Magic is what Rothman is going to have to create. A stuttering global economic recovery is expected to curve consumer demand around the globe. Thus, this makes Rothman's job more challenging. Sony Corp. as a whole, is undergoing a restructuring plan. This includes strengthening core businesses, turning around the television business, and expanding products into new markets. Of the last six years , SNE has had only one year with a positive net income, which was 2013. The movie industry in general has been suffering. On Tuesday, Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc. (NASDAQ: DWA ) announced a fourth quarter loss of $263.2 million. Similar to what Sony Pictures will be doing, DreamWorks recently underwent a restructuring, which will eliminate over 500 jobs and remove movies from its release schedule. Fazel Merchant, CFO of DreamWorks, has turned his focus to diversifying his company and vowing to turn the studio firm division around. As Rothman enters his new role, he will be taking control of the Motion Pictures Segment which accounted for 11% of SNE's revenue in 2014. If he can produce blockbuster hits as he did at FOX, Sony should see a nice addition to its overall revenue as a result of this segment. Only time will tell. Lynton said in a statement Tuesday that, "Tom knows this business inside and out like few others do." Hopefully he is right, Sony Corp. could use a movie franchise or two to generate large amounts of predictable revenue and cash flow for years to come.
