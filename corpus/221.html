4.4% Dividend Health Care REIT Provides Steady Growth And Income - Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN) | Seeking Alpha HCN had a 48.5% total return for FY2014. Unfortunately, that probably means it is a little overvalued. The REIT has had a long-term uptrend in place since 2000. HCN pays a consistently growing 4.4% dividend, and it may be a good place for long-term investors to ride out troubles. The fundamentals behind HCN are outstanding. Even if the stock price falls, it is sure to go back up; and the company will pay you to wait. Health Care REIT Inc. (NYSE: HCN ) is a real estate investment trust. It focuses on acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning, and monetizing real estate assets in the U.S. ( 87.5% ), Canada (5.3%), and the U.K. (7.2%). It primarily invests in senior living and healthcare properties. It focuses on superior properties in affluent, high-barrier-to-entry metropolitan markets. HCN partners with leading operators for senior housing and health systems that deliver superior value while maintaining above-average earnings. 94% of the company's medical office building portfolio is affiliated with a healthcare system. It has a portfolio of 1,328 properties in 46 states, Canada, and the U.K. It has a $37B enterprise value. It carries a Moody's rating of Baa2, a Fitch rating of BBB+, and an S&P rating of BBB. These are all solid investment-grade ratings. HCN's revenues come 87% from private pay sources (which are high-quality). For FY2014, HCN produced normalized FFO of $4.13 per share - an 8% increase year-over-year - and FAD (funds available for distribution) of $3.66 per share - a 9% increase year-over-year. Same-store NOI (net operating income) growth was +4.2% year-over-year. The senior housing operating portfolio was exceptionally productive, with +7.3% growth. The company completed $3.7B in new investments. It divested $900 million in non-strategic assets, in keeping with its long-term strategy of only keeping its best assets. For FY2014, HCN generated a 48.5% total return. HCN has had an average annual total return of 16.1% since inception, so it is likely to be a little overextended at the moment. For Q4 2014, the company produced normalized FFO of $1.03 (+4% YOY) and FAD of $0.91 (+6% YOY). HCN invested $1.8B in high-quality assets. The initial cash yield was 7.2% . It saw +3.5% NOI growth YOY (+5.7% in the hot senior housing operating portfolio). The Q4 2014 dividend was up +4% YOY to $0.825 per share from $0.795 per share in Q4 2013. The NOI (net operating income) table below for Q4 2014 shows just how important and how impressive HCN's senior housing operating portfolio was. As investors can see, the Senior Housing Operating Portfolio not only saw the best increase year-over-year of +5.7%; it was also the largest single component of HCN's core portfolio at 34.9%. The core portfolio excludes loans and assets held for sale. Investors should remember that the U.S. is in the early stages of the Baby Boomer retirement phase. Good to great growth in this area should continue for many years into the future. The charts below give investors an idea of just how good the demographics are. In addition to the above, the U.S. is expected to see incremental adds from the ACA (Obamacare). Medical facilities of all types should see good growth for this reason, at least through 2017. The fundamentals behind the company's growth and performance are extremely strong. HCN generated a 48.5% total return for FY2014. Senior Housing operating average NOI growth has been +8.2% for the last 15 quarters, although HCN's total portfolio has only averaged +4.0% growth over the same period. Although perhaps not as fiscally important, the above overview gives investors a good feel for what businesses HCN is managing. Guidance for FY2015 is for FFO of $4.25-4.35 per diluted share (a +3% to +5% increase). FAD is projected to be $3.83-3.93 per diluted share (a +5% to +7% increase year-over-year). Same-Store Cash NOI is projected to grow 3.0-3.5% for the year. The company also guided for sundry acquisitions and dispositions, including about $250 million for acquisitions for its Mainstreet Property Group collaboration. In Q1 2015 HCN has already successfully completed a stock offering of 19,550,000 shares at a price of $75.50 per share, for total gross proceeds of about $1.5B. HCN plans to use the net proceeds to repay advances under its primary unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including investing in healthcare and seniors housing properties. HCN expects to close on $2.2B in investments in Q1 2015. Obviously, the good growth is continuing, and the debt is not piling up overly quickly. This shows good management. The performance of HCN since 2000 has been good to great, with a strong, consistent upward trend. For the long term, the stock looks a bit overpriced, even after its recent pullback. However, the 50-day SMA appears to be a very strong support line. The fundamentals of HCN would also tend to confirm strong support at such a support point. HCN is probably buyable on the current pullback. It is far oversold at the moment, so technically, investors can buy it. However, the direction of the overall market may have more to do with the near-term performance; and HCN has a ways to go to reach a strong support point at the 50-day SMA (about $62-65 per share). I will not try to predict the market direction in this article. Such items as a possible Greek exit of the eurozone and the possibility that the Fed may raise its rates soon may play big factors. Investors should be comforted that HCN is a good long-term investment with a 4.4% dividend. HCN will pay you to wait for any rebound that may be needed; and the fundamentals are such that they almost guarantee a rebound (see the demographics charts above). For long-term income investors, HCN represents a relatively safe investment that will pay a dividend greater than the 30-year Treasury Bond yield ( 2.68% as of March 11, 2015). The dividend history shows that HCN's dividend has risen consistently since 2009, which is reassuring. The Price/Book ratio of 2.02 is reasonable for this type of investment. The PE of 51.09 seems a bit pricey, but the FPE of 16.1 is quite reasonable. Shorter-term investors will probably want to wait for a bigger pullback. Longer-term investors could buy now for the income. Traders might consider buying now on technicals. Traders will have to decide for themselves the near-term direction of the overall market.
