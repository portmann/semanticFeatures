While dissatisfaction with government is by no means a new issue to the American people, it has not in recent months been as clearly the leading problem as it is now, given that fewer Americans mention the economy. Meanwhile, satisfaction with the direction of the U.S. remains relatively upbeat compared with figures from recent years, but two-thirds of Americans continue to be dissatisfied. Thu, 03/12/2015 - 11:47 | 5881684 Greenskeeper_Carl Just wait another year or so when the economy tanks for real, it will shoot up, along with dissatisfaction with government. It's also refreshing to see that since it didn't even get 3%, global warming bullshit didn't even register, despite the endless propaganda people are bombarded with by the Obama regime and the media. Maybe the propaganda isn't as effective as I thought. As much as the cynic in me doesn't want to admit it, this poll ALMOST makes me a little optimistic Thu, 03/12/2015 - 11:52 | 5881717 lasvegaspersona Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:06 | 5881770 Mister Ponzi You have to add the 4% who mentioned 'Foreign Policy' as the most urgent problem to the 18% because it is actually the same problem - dissatisfaction with government (policy). I would say that yes, what americans think IS the #1 problem. Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:19 | 5881850 maskone909 critical thinking, reading comprehension, the follies of the common man.  or atleast we are lead to believe that.  trying to be a glass half full kinda guy today Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:49 | 5881984 Save_America1st Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:05 | 5882023 J S Bach I disagree.  To me, there is only ONE main problem with our global society.  That is: what kind of monetary system we have and who controls it.  All other issues (including government) are trickle-down results of the actions of the money masters who control us all.   With their pockets collecting the usurious interest on trillions of dollars, yen, euros, etc... they have complete autonomy over us.  With this power, they buy scum politicians and influence which shapes the course of all world events. Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:17 | 5882087 maskone909 youre right.  in socialist new world govenment, banks and government are one in the same.  that old saying, money is the root of all evil.  well, maybe it should have went something more like, "fiat money lent with interest is the root of all evil". actually can i redact all of my previous comments?  im now learning that the real reason for such vast discontent among the american populace is the discontinuation of the Mc Rib  sandwhich at mickey deez.  its all so blatantly clear now. The rise of Domestic Extremists like most ZHers who think they should have "freedumb" in their lives (ha ha) Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:50 | 5882196 crusty curmudgeon Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:21 | 5882102 Chief KnocAHoma Careful Bach... Jesus threw the money changers out of the Temple and was hanging on a cross within three days. They don't like when the righteous challenge their cash flow. You know those credit cards every one is offered, at 24%+ rates?  Thats usury. Its fascinating to me that THAT stuff used to get you killed, or at least exiled, in medieval times.  And these days, its just run of the mill!  Wonga etc can advertise on TV, and credit card companies can send you a credit card unsolicited, in the mail! Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:43 | 5882175 Miffed Microbio... Personally, asking general questions is useless in any polling. What I think about government is vastly different from my neighbor that retired at 55 and is grossing 15k a month gov. pension. Even those " job surveys" at work tho "improve" the work place are a farce. The last one I took had one area you could comment. The question was " tell how you feel this is the best place to work" I proceeded to do the opposite when I quickly ran out of characters and it automatically submitted with no way to return to change your answers. I just started drawing my 'pension' at age 56...$954.00/mo.....filled out the forms not 2 months ago, just got the first 2 checks allegedly deposited....figured I better get 'something' before some mudwhistler accountant stole it all.... Evidently I chose the wrong career path and went into American Manufacturing...was in a shitty, dark, unwholesome shop every morning on time at O dark for 30yrs straight...not missing a day ever, making shit out of heavy bars of steel...and I have at least 10 yrs to go!  What a fucking dope I am, on that we can all agree!  Save me Lord Jesus! I got involved in some local issues to see if there was indeed local control.

If you think deeper, and refrain shooting from the hip, you'll find the real culprits: 1. The Banksters: Currency & Banking Ponzi (fiat money + FRB) 2. The Body Politic: Hijacked Governance process (lobbying --> who runs and gets elected --> corruption of Checks & Balances) 3. The People: Too many Voters  are dumb, lazy and uniformed, to keep #1 and #2 in line.  "We have seen the enemy, and he is us". Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:52 | 5881995 RaceToTheBottom What about the FED?  Or is that mixed in with Government? I recognise that surveys have to be dumbed down, but I question whether any actionable data can be drawn from this... Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:16 | 5882059 A Nanny Moose The superstition that even more government will fix all those fuck-ups resulting from past demands for even more government. We never seem to learn. What is overlooked is any discussion on the need for government altogether. Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:10 | 5881791 armageddon addahere Goldman Sachs sold their shares in the carbon credit exchange 2 years ago. That was when I knew the big boys had abandoned that scam. There is still a raggedy ass band of true believers who will keep moaning about Global Warming or Climate Change until they die and so politicians will pay lip service but no one takes it seriously.

Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:27 | 5882126 Chief KnocAHoma Humans may have SOME effect on the environment, but just a few hours from my home is a very large vein of coal running through the foothills of the Appalacians. This vein was formed by shifting glaciers a very long time ago. Long before the automobile or even plastic bottles.  Thu, 03/12/2015 - 13:40 | 5882163 petroglyph Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:02 | 5881753 venturen 2. too many deadbeats that wont work or get an education 3. politicians are bought by big business and rewarded with favorable circumstances therefore undermining capitalism. losers now win, winners now lose. 4. governemnt propping up bullshit companies, tesla, solyndra, etc 5. too many people dont pay taxes and vote to take more stuff from the actual taxpayers 6. welfare underacheivers are out breeding alphas therefore lowering the bar 7. too many deadbeat parents that dont teach their children right from wrong, discipline, or the value of an education Thu, 03/12/2015 - 12:13 | 5881799 SethDealer Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 03-12 13:39: Zillow's (Z) Trulia unit could lose an appeal to block ListHub... 03-12 13:39: Garmin (GRMN) has adopted rule 10B5-1 plan in a USD 300mln share... 03-12 13:39: To note for Charter (CHTR), Bright House spokesperson reports that... 03-12 13:39: XOMA Corp (XOMA) upgraded from neutral to buy at Ladenberg 03-12 13:39: NGL Energy Partners (NGL) CEO Michael Krimbill bought 20,000 shares... 03-12 13:39: Hutchison Port price their USD 500mln 3y issuance at +127.5bps and... 03-12 13:39: Banking sources say Sabadell (SAB SM) is looking to raise... 03-12 13:33: Publicis acquires omni-channel services firm Expicient 03-12 13:33: Red Hat April volatility elevated into Q4 and outlook 03-12 13:57: NGL Energy CEO Krimbill Buys 20,000 Shares @$26.98/Share -Form 4 03-12 13:57: Spike in H&E Equipment Services May be Due to Tweet: 'PureData â€?@PureData_Report  3m3 minutes ago #Frankfurt #stocks: #Merger #Acquisition: H&E Equipment Services : Mar 2015 growth predicted as scant. http://dg-di.net/DI/GM2/03561.htm ...' 03-12 13:57: Publicis Acquires Expicient 03-12 13:57: Disney Announces Frozen Sequel 03-12 13:24: 30-Year Bonds Draw 2.681%, Allotted at High 98.37%, Bid/Cover 2.18 Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 03-12 12:09: What Americans Think Is The #1 US Problem 03-12 11:55: The Mystery Of America's Missing Wage Growth Has Been Solved 03-12 11:15: Why I Don't Want An Apple Watch (And It's Not Battery Life) 03-12 9:24: Are Alarm Bells Ringing Over Greece's Pivot To Russia? 03-12 7:45: Two Police Officers Shot Outside Ferguson Police Department: Shooting Caught On Tape 03-12 9:57: Is This Why Stocks Are Soaring, And Some Context For Today's Melt-Up 03-12 8:02: Fed Will Open "Pandora's Box" With Rate Hike, UBS Warns Make sure to read our " How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters] " Guide It would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .
