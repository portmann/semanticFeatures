Iâ€™m not disappearing.Â  Iâ€™m just relocating . But the Wealth Reportâ€™s success came mostly from its readers and commenters.

I'm getting sick and tired of WordPress because I've had issues with hackers and I'm looking at options for another platform. I would be awesome if you could point me in the direction of a good platform. Woah! I'm really digging the template/theme of this site. It's simple, yet effective. A lot of times it's very difficult to get that "perfect balance" between superb usability and visual appearance. I must say you have done a awesome job with this. In addition, the blog loads extremely fast for me on Opera. Outstanding Blog! Howdy, i read your blog occasionally and i own a similar one and i was just curious if you get a lot of spam remarks? If so how do you stop it, any plugin or anything you can advise? I get so much lately it's driving me insane so any assistance is very much appreciated.
