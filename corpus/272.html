NICE-Systems Still A Buy At All-Time Highs - NICE-Systems Limited (NASDAQ:NICE) | Seeking Alpha NICE has made an all-time high post fourth quarter earnings. Its analytic solutions are seeing huge demand around the globe. The share price of NICE-Systems (NASDAQ: NICE ), an Israeli company that provides software solutions to organizations for ensuring compliance, fighting financial crime and safeguarding assets, has recently moved to an all-time high of $55.70 post fourth quarter 2014 earnings. I believe the shares of NICE will continue to move higher as a result of the company's immense growth opportunities in the analytic solutions business across the globe. In this article I'll focus on the growth opportunities. NICE's analytic solutions allow companies to capture and analyze big data in real time to develop actionable insights. The data is primarily sourced from phone calls, social media, videos and mobile apps. The insights are applied to improve the companies' customer experience and business results. In addition, the insights also help companies ensure compliance and fight financial crime. For example, the company's voice biometric technology can identify legitimate customers calling a contact center. The technology can detect fraud attempts by matching a caller's voice print to an existing fraudster black list. Over 25,000 companies in more than 150 countries use NICE's solutions, which include more than 80 Fortune 100 companies. NICE is well-positioned to grow revenue from its analytic solutions business by leveraging its product leadership. The company said that going forward its revenues will come from three critical domains - viz., protecting people's money, ensuring their safety and improving their experiences - each of which represents a large addressable market for the company. I believe that from the current year NICE's revenues will see significant growth, which in turn will boost its share price. I'll discuss the company's valuation and projected share price in the following section. For full-year 2014, the company's revenue crossed $1 billion as a result of successful execution of the strategy it initiated in the first half of 2014. In fourth quarter of 2014, NICE generated revenues of $294 million, up 9% year-over-year. I believe the company's revenues will continue to grow at such a run rate for some more years, i.e., approximately at a CAGR of 10%. The company's 2015 revenue is expected to be around $1.1 billion or $18.30 per share with 60.10 million shares outstanding. The projected share price is $64.05 based on 3.5x 2015 revenue. The company's 2014 full-year earnings came in at $2.85 per share on a non-GAAP basis, and estimated non-GAAP earnings for the next fiscal year is $3.03 per share. At 25x next fiscal year earnings, the stock should trade at $75.75. However, my target price for the stock is $69.90, the average of the two prices deduced above. NICE EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts Low Barriers to Entry in Analytics Business Could be Risky Analytics constitute the major part of around 60% of NICE's business. The barriers to entry in the analytics business are relatively low and as a result competition could rise in the field going forward. Intensifying competition could negatively impact the company's growth opportunities. I believe this is the only downside for the stock. NICE announced that its CFO Dafna Gruber is leaving the company, which could be a significant loss for the management. However, I'm impressed with the management under the leadership of Barak Eilam, chief executive of the company. I believe management's focused initiative that was initiated earlier in 2014 coupled with improving execution will create significant value for NICE shareholders over the long-term.
